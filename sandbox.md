# Gen.1

Gen.1.1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

Gen.1.2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Gen.1.3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Gen.1.4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

# Gen.2

Gen.2.1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

Gen.2.2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

Gen.2.3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
