## Psalms 1

1. Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners and has not sat in the seat of scorners.

2. But his delight is only in the law of Jehovah, and he meditates in His law day and night.

3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivulets of waters, which will give its fruit in its seasons, and its leaf will not wither, and all which he does will prosper.   

4. Not so are the wicked, but they are only as chaff which the wind drives about.

5. On account of this the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6. For Jehovah is knowing the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.  

## Psalms 2

1. Why have the nations raged and the peoples are meditating on vanity?

2. The kings of the earth set themselves; yea, the rulers have plotted together against Jehovah and His anointed, saying ,

3. We will break their bands in two, and throw off their cords from us.

4. He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; Jehovah shall mock at them.

5. Then He will speak to them in His anger, and He will terrify them in His wrath;

6. Yea, I have set My king on My holy mount on Zion.   

7. I will declare concerning the statute of Jehovah: He said to Me, You are My Son. Today I have begotten You.

8. Ask of Me, and I will give the nations as Your inheritance; and the uttermost parts of the earth as Your possession.

9. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.   

10. Now, then, be wise, O kings; be taught, O judges of the earth:

11. Serve Jehovah with fear; yea, rejoice with trembling.

12. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Oh the blessings of all those who flee to Him for refuge!  

## Psalms 3

1.  A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom O Jehovah, how my adversaries have multiplied! Many are the ones who rise against me.

4. I cried to Jehovah with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy mountain. Selah.

5. I laid down, and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah kept me.

4. For You are not a God enjoying wickedness; nor shall evil live with You.

5. The boasters shall not set themselves before Your eyes. You hate all workers of iniquity.

6. You shall destroy those speaking lies; Jehovah will despise the man of blood and deceit.   

7. But I, in the plenty of Your grace, I will come into Your house. I will worship in Your fear toward Your holy temple, O Jehovah.

8. Lead me in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.

9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is engulfing ruin; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.

10. O God, hold them guilty; let them fall from their own counsels. Drive them away in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.

11. But let all who put their trust in You rejoice; let them shout for joy forever, because You cover them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.

12. For You, O Jehovah, will bless the righteous; You will surround him with favor, as with a shield.  

## Psalms 6

1.  To the chief musician, for eight-stringed instruments. A Psalm of David O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your anger; nor chasten me in the heat of Your fury;

3. My soul also is greatly troubled and You, O Jehovah, until when?

4. O Jehovah, return, deliver my soul; save me for Your mercy's sake.

5. For there is no memory of You in death; who shall give thanks to You in Sheol?

6. I am weary in my groaning; I shall make by bed swim in all the night; I melt my couch with my tears.

7. My eye is dim because of grief; it wastes away because of all my vexers.   

8. Depart from me, all workers of iniquity, for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.

10. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back, ashamed in a moment.  

## Psalms 7

1.  A song of David, which he sang to Jehovah on the words of Cush the Benjamite. O Jehovah my God, I seek refuge in You; save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me;

2. lest he tear my soul like a lion, ripping, and there be no one to deliver.

3. O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands:

4. if I have repaid evil to my friend or I have plundered my vexer without cause,

5. let the enemy pursue and overtake my soul; yea, trample down my life to earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; be lifted up at the rage of my vexers; and awake for Me! You have commanded judgment.

7. And the assembly of the peoples shall surround You, and over it You will return on high;

8. Jehovah will judge the people. O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity on me.

13. yea, He has fitted for him instruments of death. He will make ready His arrows for pursuers.

14. Behold, he writhes with iniquity and he will conceive mischief: and he has fathered falsehood;

15. he dug a pit and bored it, and has fallen into the ditch he made.

16. His mischief shall return on his own head, and his violence shall come down on his own crown.

17. I will thank Jehovah according to His righteousness, and will praise the name of Jehovah most high.

3. When I look upon Your heavens, the work of Your fingers: the moon and the stars which You have fixed;

4. what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man, that You visit him?

5. For You have made him lack a little from God; and have crowned him with glory and honor.

6. You made him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all under his feet,

7. all flocks and oxen, and also the animals of the field,

2. I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will praise Your name, O Most High.

3. When my enemies turn back, they will fall and perish before You.

4. For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging right.

5. You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have put out their name forever and ever.

6. The desolations of the enemy are ended forever; and You have uprooted the cities; their memory has perished with them.

8. And He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.

9. Jehovah also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of distress.

14. So that I may declare all Your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion; I will rejoice in Your salvation.

15. The nations have sunk into the pit they made; their foot is caught in the net they hid.

16. Jehovah has been known, He has executed judgment; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. A meditation, Selah.

17. The wicked shall be turned to Sheol, all the nations forgetting God.

18. For the needy shall not forever be forgotten; the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.

3. For the wicked boasts of his soul's desire, and he has blessed the covetous; he has despised Jehovah.

4. Through pride of his face, the wicked will not seek; there is no God in all of his schemes.

5. His ways are perverted at all times. Your judgments are high from his sight; as for all his vexers, he puffs at them.

6. He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved! From generation to generation never will I be in evil.

7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and injury; under his tongue are mischief and vanity.

8. He sits in the hiding places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent; his eyes watch against the poor.

9. He lies in wait secretly like a lion in his den; he lies in ambush to catch the poor; he seizes the poor, drawing him into his net;

10. and being crushed, he bows; and the poor have fallen by his strong ones.

11. He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will not see forever.   

12. Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up your hand; do not forget the lowly ones.

13. Why does the wicked one despise God? He has said in his heart, You will not inquire into us

14. You have seen, for You take note of mischief and vexation, to repay with Your hand. The poor leaves himself to You; You are the helper of the orphan.

16. Jehovah is king forever and ever; the nations have perished out of His land.

17. O Jehovah, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will prepare their heart. Your ear will hear,

18. judge the orphan and the crushed. No more shall the man of the earth continue to terrify.  

## Psalms 11

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. I sought refuge in Jehovah; how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to your hill.

## Psalms 12

1.  To the chief musician, on eight. A Psalm of David. Help, O Jehovah, for the saint ceases to be; for the faithful fail from among the sons of men.

3. Jehovah shall cut off all with flattering lips and the tongue that speaks great things;

4. Who say, We shall be strong by our tongue; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?

5. For the pain of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, I will now rise up, says Jehovah; I will set in safety; he pants for it.

2. Until when shall I set counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? Until when shall my enemy be lifted up over me?

3. Look! Answer me, O Jehovah, my God! Make my eyes gleam, lest I sleep the death;

4. lest my enemy say, I have overcome him and my foes rejoice when I am shaken.

5. But I have trusted in Your mercy. My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.

6. I will sing to Jehovah, because He has rewarded me.  

## Psalms 14

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They acted corruptly; they did hatefully in deeds; there is none doing good.

2. Jehovah looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind, to see if there were any discerning and seeking God:

3. they have all turned aside; together they have become filthy; there is none doing good; not even one!   

4. Have all evildoers not known, eating My people as they eat bread? They have not called on Jehovah.

5. There they were afraid of terror, for God is in the righteous generation.

6. You have shamed the counsel of the afflicted, for Jehovah is his refuge.

7. Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When Jehovah brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.

3.  He does not backbite with his tongue, nor do evil to his friend, nor lift up a reproach against his neighbor.

4. In his eyes, the reprobate has been despised, but he honors those who fear Jehovah: He has sworn to his hurt, and will not change it.

5.  He has not given his silver at interest; nor has he taken a bribe against the innocent; he who does these things shall not be shaken forever.  

## Psalms 16

1.  A Secret Treasure of David. Watch over me, O God, for I take refuge in You.

2.  Oh my soul you have said to Jehovah, You are my Lord; My goodness is nothing apart from You.

3. As for the saints in the earth, they are the excellent ones; all my delight is in them.

4. Their sorrows shall multiply if they run after another god . I will not pour out their drink offering of blood; and I will not take their names on my lips.

5. Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; You shall surely uphold my destiny.

6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places ; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.

7. I will bless Jehovah, who counseled me. My reins also teach me in the nights.   

8. I have set Jehovah always before me; for He is at my right hand: I shall not be shaken.

9. So my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; my flesh shall also rest in hope;

10. For You will not leave My soul in Sheol; You will not give Your Holy One to see corruption.

11. You will make Me know the way of life. In Your presence is fullness of joys; at Your right hand are pleasures forever.  

## Psalms 17

1.  A Prayer of David. O Jehovah, hear righteousness; listen to my cry; give ear to my prayer, for it is not in lips of deceit.

2. Let my judgment go out from Your face; Your eyes see uprightly.

5. My steps have kept in Your tracks, so that my strides have not slipped.

6. I have called on You, for You will answer me, O God; bow down Your ear to me and hear my word.

7. Set out your wonderful loving-kindness by Your right hand, O Savior of those who trust in You , from those rising against them .   

8. Keep me as the pupil, the daughter of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings,

9. from the face of the wicked who stripped me; against my soul, my enemies go all around me.

10. They are enclosed in their own fat; their mouth speaks proudly;

11. now they have hemmed in our steps; they set their eyes to cast me to the earth;

12. like a lion who longs to tear, and like a young lion sitting in hidden dens.

13. Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face and bow him down! Deliver my soul from the wicked, by Your sword,

14. from men, by Your hand, O Jehovah, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and their belly You fill with Your treasure; they are satisfied with sons, and will leave their riches to their babes.

15.  As for me, in righteousness I will look upon Your face; when I awaken, I shall be satisfied by Your image.  

## Psalms 18

1.  To the chief musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah, who spoke the words of this song to Jehovah in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his foes, and from the hand of Saul. And he said: I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.

2. Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress and my deliverer; my God, my Rock; I seek refuge in Him; He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.

3. I will call on Jehovah, who is to be praised; and I shall be saved from my enemies.

4. The cords of death hemmed me in; yea, the floods of ungodly men overwhelmed me;

5. cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.

6. In my distress I called on Jehovah and I cried to my God; He heard my voice out of His temple, and my cry went before Him, into His ears.

7. Then the earth shook and trembled; and the foundations of the mountains moved and were shaken, because it angered Him.

8. A smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire devoured out of His mouth; coals were kindled from it.

9. He bowed the heavens also and came down, and darkness was under His feet;

10. and He rode on a cherub, and He flew; yea He soared on the wings of the wind;

11. He made darkness His covering, His pavilion all around Him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

12. Out of the brightness before Him, His dark clouds passed through, hailstones and coals of fire.

13. Jehovah also thundered in the heavens; and the Highest uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.

14. Yea, He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He shot out lightnings and confounded them.

15. Then the stream beds of waters were seen, and the foundations of the earth were bared at Your rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.

16. He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters;

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from my haters; for they were stronger than I.

18. They went before my face in my day of calamity, but Jehovah was my support.

19. And He brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me;   

20. Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands, He has repaid me.

21. For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all His judgments were before me, and I did not turn away His statutes from me.

23. For I was upright with Him, and kept myself from my guilt.

24. And Jehovah has returned to me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands before His eyes.

25. With the merciful, You reveal Yourself as merciful; with an upright man, You reveal yourself as upright;

26. with the pure, You reveal Yourself as pure; and with the crooked, You appear perverse;

27. for You will save an afflicted people, but will bring down haughty eyes.

28. For You will light my lamp; Jehovah my God will make my darkness light.   

29. For through You I can run through a troop; and through my God I have leaped over a wall.

30.  As for God, His way is perfect; the word of Jehovah is purified; He is a shield to all who seek refuge in Him.

31. For who is God besides Jehovah? Or who is a Rock except our God?

32.  It is God who girds me with strength and gives my way to be perfect;

33. setting my feet like the deer, and making me stand on my high places;

34. teaching my hands to war, so that a bow of bronze is bent by my arms.

35. You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; and Your right hand holds me up; and Your condescension has made me great.

36. You have made a wide place under me for my steps, so that my ankles have not slipped.

37. I have pursued my enemies and have overtaken them; nor did I turn till they were consumed.

38. I have shattered them, and they cannot rise up; they fell under my feet.

39. And You have girded me with strength for the battle; You have bowed under me those rising against me.

40. And you have given me the neck of my enemies, that I might cut off my haters.

41. They cried, but no one is there to save; to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.

42. And I crushed them like the dust before the wind; I emptied them out like the mire of the streets.

43. You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me head of the nations; a people I have not known shall serve me.

44. At the hearing of the ear they listen to me; the sons of foreigners shall bow down to me.

45. The sons of foreigners shall faint and come trembling out of their strongholds.

46. Jehovah lives! And blessed be my Rock! And let the God of my salvation be exalted!

47.  He is the God who avenges me, and speaks to people under me.

48. He delivers me from my enemies; yea, You lift me up from among those rising up against me. You have delivered me from the violent man.

49. On account of this I will extol You, O Jehovah, among the nations. and I will sing praises to Your name,

50. magnifying salvations to His king, and working mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed forever.  

## Psalms 19

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens are recording the glory of God, and the expanse proclaim His handiwork.

2. Day by day they pour forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.

3.  There is no speech, nor are there words where their voice is not heard.

4. Their measuring line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world; in them He has set up a dwelling-place for the sun,

5. and he comes forth like a bridegroom from his canopy. He rejoices like a hero to run a race;

6. his going forth from the end of the heavens, and his orbit to their ends; and nothing is hidden from his heat.   

7. The law of Jehovah is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making the simple wise.

8. The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commands of Jehovah are pure, giving light to the eyes.

9. The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of Jehovah are true, they are righteous altogether.

10.  They are more precious than gold, even much fine gold, and sweeter than honey and drops from the honeycomb.

11. Also Your servant is warned by them; in keeping of them is great reward.

12. Who can discern errors? Acquit me from secret faults ,

13. also withhold Your servant from arrogant sins ; do not let them rule over me; then I shall be upright, and shall be innocent from great transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing before You, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.

4. He will give you according to your heart, and fulfill all your plans.

4. He asked life from You: You gave to him length of days forever and ever.

5. His glory is great in Your salvation; You have laid honor and majesty on him.

6. For You have set him blessings forever; You have rejoiced him in the joy of Your face.   

7. For the king trusts in Jehovah, and in the mercy of the Most High; he will not be shaken.

8. Your hand shall find out all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find out Your haters.

9. You shall set them as a fiery furnace in the time of Your presence; Jehovah will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire will devour them.

10. You shall destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from the sons of men.

12. for You shall make them turn the back; against their faces You shall make ready Your arrows on Your strings.

13. Be exalted, O Jehovah, in Your strength; we will sing, and sing psalms of Your power.  

## Psalms 22

1. To the Chief Musician, on the deer of the dawn. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me, and are far from my deliverance, from the words of my groaning?

2. O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer; and in the night, and there is no silence to me.

3. But You are holy, being enthroned on Israel's praises.

4. Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them.

5. They cried to You, and were delivered; they trusted in You, and were not ashamed.

6. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of mankind, and despised by the people.

7. All who see Me scornfully laugh at me; they open the lip; they shake the head, saying ,

8. He rolled on Jehovah, let Him deliver Him; let Him rescue Him, since He delights in Him.

9. For You are He , my Taker from the womb; causing me to trust on My mother's breasts.

10. I was cast on You from the womb, from My mother's belly, You are my God.   

11. Be not far from Me; for trouble is near; because no one is there to help.

12. Many bulls have circled around Me; strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded Me.

13. They opened their mouth on Me, like a lion ripping and roaring.

14. I am poured out like waters, and all My bones are spread apart; My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of My bowels.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and My tongue clings to My jaws;

16. and You appoint Me to the dust of death; for dogs have encircled Me; band of spoilers have hemmed Me in, piercers of My hands and My feet.

17. I count all My bones; they look, they stare at Me.

18. They divide My garments among them, and they made fall a lot for My clothing.

13. the Lord laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.

2. For Your arrows sink in me, and Your hand presses heavily on me.

3.  There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger; nor peace in my bones because of my sin.

4. For my iniquities have passed over my head, as a heavy burden too heavy for me.

5. My wounds have putrefied and rotted, because of my foolishness.

6. I am bent down, I am bowed down exceedingly; I went mourning all the day long.

7. For my loins are filled with a burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am exceedingly benumbed and crushed. I howl from the groanings of my heart.

9. My Lord, all my desire is before You, and my sighing is not hidden from You.

10. My heart throbs; my power forsakes me! And the light of my eyes, they also are not with me.

11. My lovers and my friends stand apart from my stroke, and my neighbors have stood far off.   

12. And those seeking my life lay a snare; yea, those seeking my evil speak ruin, and they utter deceits all the day long.

13. But like a deaf one I do not hear; and I am like a dumb one who does not open his mouth.

14. And I am as a man who is not hearing, and who has no rebukes in his mouth.

15. For I hope in You, O Jehovah; O Lord my God You will answer.

16. For I said, Lest they rejoice over me in the slipping of my foot; they exalt themselves over me.

17. For I am ready to fall and my pain is before me always.

22. Make haste to help me, O my Lord, my salvation.  

## Psalms 39

1.  To the chief musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will keep my ways from sinning with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me.

2. I became dumb, keeping still; from good I was silent, and my pain was stirred.

3. My heart was hot within me; while the fire burned I was meditating; I spoke with my tongue:

4. O Jehovah, make me to know my end and the limit of my days, what it is . Let me know how lacking I am .

5. Behold, like a handbreadth You gave my days, even my life was non-existence before You ;

6. surely every man walks about in shadow; surely they are in an uproar in vain; he heaps up and does not know who is gathering them.   

7. And now what do I await, Lord? My hope is in You.

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not set me forth as the reproach of the fool.

9. I was dumb; I did not open my mouth, because You had done it .

10. Remove Your stroke from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.

11. You correct a man with rebukes over perversity; and as a moth You consume what he desires. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears, for I am an alien with You, a pilgrim, as were all my fathers.

13. Look away from me and I will be cheerful before I go away and be no more.  

## Psalms 40

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. Waiting I have waited on Jehovah; and He bowed to me and heard my cry.

2. And He drew me up from the pit of tumult, out of the miry clay; He set my feet on a rock; He directed my steps.

3. And He put a new song of praise to our God in my mouth; many shall see and shall fear and shall trust in Jehovah.

4. Blessed is the man who sets Jehovah as his trust, and does not turn to the proud, or to those who turn to a lie.

5. Many things have You done, O Jehovah my God; Your works of wonder and Your purposes toward us; there is none to set in order to You; I will declare and I will speak; they are more than can be counted.   

6. Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; You have opened ears to Me. You have not asked burnt offering and sin offering.

7. Then I said, Lo, I come, in the roll of the Book it is written of Me;

8. I delight to do Your will, O My God; and Your law is within My inmost soul .

9. I have announced righteousness in the great assembly; behold, I will not restrain My lips; O Jehovah You know.

10. I have not concealed Your righteousness in My heart; I speak Your faithfulness and Your salvation. I have not hidden Your loving-kindness and Your truth for the great assembly.   

11. Do not withhold Your tender mercies from Me, O Jehovah; let Your lovingkindness and Your truth always watch over Me.

12. For evils have surrounded me until there is no number; my iniquities have taken hold on me and I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me.

13. Be pleased to deliver me, O Jehovah; hasten to my help.

14. Let be ashamed and humbled together those seeking my soul, to destroy it; let those delighting in my evil be driven back and disgraced.

15. Let them be desolate until it is the reward for their shame; for they are saying to me, Aha! Aha!

16. Let all who are seeking You be glad in You and always say, May Jehovah be magnified, those loving Your salvation.

17. But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay.  

## Psalms 41

1.  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he who acts wisely toward the poor; Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.

2. Jehovah will watch over him and keep him alive; he shall be blessed on the earth, and You will not deliver him to the soul of his enemies.

3. Jehovah will uphold him on the couch of sickness; You change all his bed in his sickness.

4. I said, O Jehovah be gracious to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.   

5. My enemies speak evil of me, saying , When will he die and his name perish.

6. And when he comes to see me he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity to itself; he goes outside and speaks.

7. All my haters whisper together against me; they plot evil against me,

8.  saying , A thing of ruin is poured out on him; and, He who lies down shall not rise again.

9. Even a man desiring my welfare, I trusted in him, eating of my bread; this one has lifted up his heel against me.

10. But You, O Jehovah, be gracious to me and raise me up, and I will repay them.

11. By this I know that You delight in me, because my enemy does not exult over me.

12. And I, in my integrity You uphold me, and You set your face before me forever.

13. Blessed be Jehovah God of Israel, even from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen!  

## Psalms 42

1.  To the chief musician. A Contemplation for the sons of Korah. As the deer pants after the channels of water, so my soul pants after You, O God.

2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?

3. My tears have been my food by day and by night, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God?

4. When I remember these things and I pour out my soul on me (for I passed over with the throng; I led them to the house of God with the voice of rejoicing and praise, a host keeping the feast).

5. Oh my soul, why are you cast down and moan within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet thank Him for the salvation of His presence.   

6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me; on account of this I remember You from Jordan-land and from the Hermons, from Mount Mizar.

7. Deep calls to deep through the voice of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows have passed over me.

8. Jehovah will command His loving-kindness by day, and His song shall be with me in the night, a prayer to the God of my life.

9. I will say to God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning when the enemy oppresses me?

10. My oppressors reproach me with crushing in my bones. when they say to me every day, Where is your God?

11. O my soul, why are you cast down? And why do you moan within me? Hope in God, for I yet thank Him for the salvation of my face and my God.  

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God, and strive for my cause against a nation not godly. Deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2. For You are the God of my strength. Why have You cast me off? Why do I go mourning when the enemy oppresses?

3. Oh send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me and bring me to the mount of Your holiness and to Your tabernacles.

4. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, the joy of my delight, and I will thank with the lyre, O God, my God.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why do you moan within me? Hope in God, for I will still thank Him, the salvations of my face, and my God.  

## Psalms 44

1.  To the chief musician. A Contemplation for the Sons of Korah. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work You did in their days, in the days of old.

2. You drove out nations with Your hand and planted them. You brought evil on peoples and expelled them.

3. For they did not inherit the land with their own sword; yea, their own arm did not save them. But it was Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your face, because You favored them.

4. You are He, my King, O God; command deliverances for Jacob.

5. Through You we will push our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me.

7. But You have saved us from our adversaries and have put to shame those who hate us.

8. We boast in God all the day long; and we praise Your name forever. Selah.   

9. Now You have cast us off and have shamed us. And You do not go forth with our armies.

10. You make us turn back from the oppressor; yea, our haters plunder for themselves.

11. You have given us like sheep for food and have scattered us among the nations.

12. For no gain You have sold Your people, and You are not increased by their price.

13. You made us a disgrace to our neighbors, a scorn and a mockery to those around us.

14. You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

15. My humiliation is before me all the day; yea, the shame of my face covers me,

16. because of the slanderer's voice and the blasphemer, before the face of the enemy and avenger.   

17. All this has come upon us, and we have not forgotten You nor dealt falsely with Your covenant.

18. Our heart has not turned back, and our steps have not swerved from Your way,

19. though You have crushed us in the place of jackals and covered us over with the death-shade.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, and have spread our hands to an alien god,

21. shall not God search out this? For He knows the secrets of the heart.

22. Yea, for Your sake we are slain all the day long; we are counted as sheep of slaughter.

23. Be aroused! Why do You sleep, O God? Awake! Do not cast us off forever.

24. Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and distress?

25. For our soul bows down to the dust; our belly holds fast to the earth.

26. Arise for our help and redeem us for the sake of Your mercy.  

## Psalms 45

1.  To the Chief Musician, Concerning the Lilies. For the sons of Korah. A Poem; a Song of the Beloved. My heart is overflowing with a good matter. I am speaking of my works to the King; my tongue is the pen of a rapid writer.

7. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; on account of this God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your fellows.

8. All Your garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of ivory palaces, by which they make You glad.

9. King's daughters are among Your precious ones; the queen stands at Your right hand in gold of Ophir.   

10. Listen, O daughter, and look, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father's house.

11. And the King will desire your beauty, for He is your Lord, and you shall worship Him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre will stroke Your face with a gift, the rich among the peoples.

13. The king's daughter is all glorious within, her clothing braided gold.

14. She shall be led to the King in embroidered work; her companions, the virgins, shall be brought to You after her.

15. They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing; they shall go in to the King's palace.

16. Your sons shall be in the place of your fathers; You will make them for rulers in all the earth.

17. I will make remembered Your name in every generation and generation; on this account people shall thank You forever and ever.  

## Psalms 46

7. Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is a refuge for us. Selah.

8. Come, behold the works of Jehovah, who sets ruins on the earth,

9. causing to cease wars to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts apart spears; He burns the chariots in the fire.

10. Be still and know that I am God! I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted in the earth.

11. Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is a refuge for us. Selah.

## Psalms 48

1.  A Song, A Psalm for the Sons of Korah. Great is Jehovah, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, His holy mountain.

2. Beautiful on high, the joy of all the earth, is Mount Zion, in the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

3. God is known in her strongholds for a refuge.

4. For, lo, the kings met together; they passed by together;

5. they saw, so they marveled; they were troubled and fled away.

6. Trembling and pain seized them there, like a woman in labor.

7. You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.   

8. As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God. God establishes it forever. Selah.

## Psalms 49

1.  To the chief musician, A Psalm for the Sons of Korah. Hear this all peoples listen, all inhabitants of the world.

2. Both sons of mankind and sons of man together, rich and poor:

3. My mouth shall speak wisdoms; and the thoughts of my heart shall be of understanding.

4. I will bow down my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying on the harp.

5. Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the perversity of my ambushers will surround me?   

6. Those who trust in their wealth, and in their many riches, boast themselves.

7. A man cannot at all redeem a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him,

8. for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceases forever,

9. for he shall yet live forever; he shall never see corruption.

10. For he sees wise men die; together the fool and the animal-like ones perish and leave their riches to others.

11. Their inward thought is that their houses shall last forever, their dwelling-places to all generations; they call lands after their own names.

12. But man shall not remain high in honor; he is like the animals; they shall be cut off.

13. This way of theirs is folly to them, yet their followers shall be pleased by their mouth. Selah.

15. But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol; for He will take me. Selah.

16. Do not be afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases;

17. for when he dies, he shall take nothing; his glory shall not go down after him.

18. For in his life he blessed his soul; yea, men praise you when you do well for yourself.

19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall not see light forever.

8. I will not reprove you for your sacrifices; yea, your burnt offerings are continually before Me;

9. I will take no bull out of your house, nor he-goats out of your folds,

10. for every beast of the forest is Mine; the cattle on a thousand hills;

11. I know all the birds of the mountains; and all moving in My fields are Mine;

12. if I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and the fullness of it.

13. Will I eat the flesh of mighty ones , and will I drink the blood of he-goats?

14. Offer thanksgiving to God; and pay your vows to the Most High.

15. And call on Me in the day of distress; and I will save you; and you shall glorify Me.   

16. But to the wicked, God says, What is it to you to proclaim My statutes, and to take up My covenant on your mouth?

17. Yea, you hate instruction, and toss My words behind you?

18. When you saw a thief, you were pleased with him; and you have taken part with adulterers.

19. You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.

20. You sit; you speak against your brother; the son of your mother; you give slander.

21. You have done these things , and I have kept silence; you thought that surely I would be like you; but I will rebuke you and set in order before your eyes.

22. Now think of this, you who forget God, lest I tear, and not any to deliver:

23. Whoever offers thanks glorifies Me; and he who prepares a way, I will show the salvation of God to him.  

## Psalms 51

1.  To the chief musician, A Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your loving-kindness, according to the multitude of Your tender mercies; blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me completely from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

3. For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me.

4. Against You, You only, I have sinned, and done evil in Your eyes; that You might be justified in Your speaking and be clear when You judge.

5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.

6. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden parts You teach me wisdom.   

7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8. Cause me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones You have crushed may rejoice.

9. Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

11. Do not cast me out from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.

12. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.

13.  Then I will teach transgressors Your ways; and sinners will turn back to You.   

14. Deliver me from the guilt of shedding blood, O God, O God of my salvation; my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.

15. O Lord, open my lips and my mouth shall declare Your praise.

16. For you do not desire sacrifice, or I would give it ; You do not delight in burnt offering.

17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

18. Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.

19. Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole offering; then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.  

## Psalms 52

1.  To the chief musician. A Contemplation. A Psalm of David when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast yourself in evil, O hero? The mercy of God is all the day.

2. Like a sharp razor, your tongue devises ruin, working deceit.

3. You love evil more than good; lying more than to speak righteousness. Selah.

4. You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!

5. God will likewise break you forever; He shall take you away, even pluck you from your tent, and uproot you out of the land of the living. Selah.   

6. And the righteous shall see and fear; yea, they will laugh over him, saying ,

7. Behold, the man who did not make God his strength; but he trusted in his many riches; he was strong in his destruction.

8. But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.

9. I will thank You forever, because You have done it ; and I will hope in Your name, for it is good before Your saints.  

## Psalms 53

1.  To the Chief musician on Mahalath. A Contemplation; A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They have done corruptly; they have committed abominable wickedness; there is not one doing good!

2. God looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind, to see if there was any discerning, who was seeking God:

3. Every one has turned away; together they are filthy; not one is doing good; not even one!

4. Have the workers of evil not known, eating up My people as they eat bread? They have not called on God.

5. There they dreaded with dread, where no dread was; for God has scattered the bones of the one who besieges you; you have put them to shame because God rejects them.

6. Who gives from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.  

## Psalms 54

1.  To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A Contemplation; A Psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself among us? Save me, O God, by Your name; and judge me by Your strength.

2. Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.

3. For strangers have risen up against me; and terrifying men seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.   

4. Behold, God is my helper. The Lord is with those who uphold my soul.

5. He shall reward evil to my enemies; cut them off in Your truth.

6. I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.

7. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; and my eye has seen its desire on my enemies.  

## Psalms 55

1.  To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A Contemplation. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and do not hide Yourself from my cry.

2. Pay attention to me, and answer me; I wander and I moan in my complaint,

3. from the voice of the enemy, from the oppression of the wicked; for they shake trouble over me, and in anger they hate me.

4. My heart is pained within me, and the terrors of death have fallen on me.

5. Fear and trembling come on me; and honor has covered me.

6. And I said, Who will give to me wings like a dove? I would fly away and be at rest.

7. I would rove far away, fleeing; I would lodge in the desert. Selah.

8. I would hasten to my escape from the rushing wind, from the tempest.   

9. Swallow up, O Lord; divide their tongue; for I see violence and strife in the city.

10. They go around her on her walls by day and night; and trouble and mischief are in her midst.

11. Covetings are in her midst; oppression and guile will not depart from her streets.

12. For it is not an enemy reproaching me, or I could bear it ; it is not one who hates me who is magnifying himself against me; or I would hide myself from him.

13. But it is you, a man of my rank, my friend and my associate.

14. We sweetened counsel together; we marched into the house of God with the throng.

15. Desolation be upon them! They go down into Sheol alive, for evils are among them in their dwelling.   

16. I, even I, will call to God, and Jehovah will save me.

17. Evening and morning, and at noon, I will complain and cry aloud; and He shall hear my voice.

18. He redeems my soul in peace from the war being waged against me for they were many with me.

19. God shall hear and answer them, even He who is enthroned of old. Selah. There are no changes to them; yea, they do not fear God.

20. He sent out his hand against those who wish him well; he polluted his covenant.

21. The butterings of his mouth were smooth, and war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, but they were as drawn swords.

22. Cast on Jehovah what He has given, and He will keep you; He will not give the righteous to waver, forever.

23. But You, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction; men of blood and deceit will not live out half their days; but I will trust in You.  

## Psalms 56

1.  To the chief musician. Concerning the silent dove, those far off. Of David, a secret treasure (when the Philistines seized him in Gath). Favor me, O God, for man snuffs me up; all the day fighting oppresses me.

2. My watchers panted for me all the day; for many are proudly fighting against me.

3. The day I am afraid, I will trust in You.

4. In God I will praise His word; in God I have trusted; I will not fear; what will flesh do to me?

5. All the day they pervert my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.

6. They stir up strife; they hide; they observe my footprints as they wait for my soul.

7. Is escape for them by iniquity? In anger the peoples cast down, O God.   

8. You have counted my wandering; O put my tears in Your bottle; are they not in Your Book?

9. Then my enemies will turn back in the day I call; this I know, for God is for me.

10. In God I will praise the Word; in Jehovah I will praise the Word.

11. In God I have trusted; I will not fear; what will man do to me?

12. On me, O God, are Your vows; I will render to You thank offerings.

13. For You have delivered my soul from death. Do You not keep my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?  

## Psalms 57

1.  To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for my soul trusts in You; yea, in the shadow of Your wings I will make my hiding place, until the great destruction passes by.

2. I will cry to God most High, to God who works for me.

3. He shall send from Heaven and save me; He will shame the one who crushes me. Selah. God shall send His mercy and His truth.

4. My soul is among lions; I lie among those on fire, the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

5. Be praised above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be over the whole earth.

6. They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me; they have fallen into it. Selah.   

7. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise.

8. Wake up my glory! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will stir the morning dawn with praise.

9. I will praise You among the peoples, O Lord, I will sing to You among the nations.

10. For Your mercy is great to the heavens, and Your truth to the clouds.

11. Be exalted above the heavens, O God; Your glory over the whole earth.  

## Psalms 58

1.  To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David. Will you indeed speak righteousness in silence? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?

2. Yes, in heart you work the evil, you weigh the violence of your hands in the land.

3. The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from the belly, speaking lies.

4. Their poison is like the poison of a snake; like the deaf adder, he stops his ear,

5. which will not hear the charmer's voice, skillful caster of spells.   

6. O God, break their teeth in their mouth; break out the big teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.

7. Let them melt away like waters; they flow off to them; he treads his arrows; let them be as though they were cut off;

8.  Let them be as a snail goes into melting, a miscarriage of a woman; they do not see the sun.

9. Before your pots can feel the thorns, whether green or glowing, He shall sweep it away.

10. The righteous shall rejoice when he sees vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

11. And man will say, Truly, a fruit is to the righteous; truly, there is a God judging in the earth.  

## Psalms 59

1.  To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A secret treasure of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; set me on high from the ones who rise up against me.

2. Deliver me from the workers of evil, and save me from bloody men.

3. For lo, they lie in wait for my soul, mighty ones gather against me; not for my transgression, and not my sin, O Jehovah.

4. Without my fault they run and prepare themselves; awaken to help me, and look on me .

5. And You, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel: Awake to visit all the nations; be not merciful to any plotting evil. Selah.

6. They return at evening; they howl like a dog, and go around the city.

7. Behold, they bellow with their mouth; swords are in their lips; for they say , Who hears?   

8. But You, O Jehovah, shall laugh at them; you shall mock at all the nations.

9. O my Strength, let me look to You; for God is my strong tower.

10. The God of my mercy shall meet me; God shall let me see my desire on my enemies.

11. Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and bring them down, O Jehovah our shield.

12.  For the sin of their mouth is the word of their lips, even let them be captured in their pride, and for cursing and the lying which they utter.

13. Consume them in Your anger; consume, so that they may not be; and they shall know that God is ruling in Jacob, to the ends of the earth. Selah.

14. Yes, they shall return at evening; let them howl like the dog and go around the city;

15. let them wander up and down for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.

16. But I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing of Your mercy in the morning. For You have been my strong tower, and my hiding place in the day of my trouble.

17. To You, O my strength, I will sing; for God is my strong tower, the God of my mercy.  

## Psalms 60

1.  To the chief musician. On the Lily of Testimony. A secret treasure of David, to teach; when he struggled with Aram-naharaim, and with Aram-zobah; when Joab returned, and struck twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. O God! You cast us off; You broke us; You who were angry; take us back.

2. You made the earth tremble; You tore it; heal its breaks, for it is shaking.

3. You have shown Your people hardship; You made us drink the wine of trembling.

4. You have given a banner to those who fear You, to lift it up because of the truth. Selah.

5. Save with Your right hand and answer me, that Your beloved may be delivered.   

6. God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is the strength of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;

8. Moab is My washpot; over Edom I will cast out My shoe; over me, Philistia, shout in triumph.

9. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?

10. Have not You, O God, cast us aside? And will You not go forth with our armies, O God?

11. Give us help against our foe, for vain is the deliverance of man.

3. Until when will you break in against a man? You will shatter him, all of you, like a bowing wall, a tottering fence.

4. Surely, they plotted to cast him down from his excellent dignity; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart. Selah.

5. Only be silent to God, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.

6. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my strong tower; I shall not be shaken.

7. On God is my salvation and my glory; my strong rock, my refuge is in God.   

8. Trust in Him at every time, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.

9. Surely the sons of men are vanity, the sons of man are a lie; they go up in the scales; they are higher than vanity together.

10. Trust not in oppression, and do not be vain in robbery; if riches increase to you, do not set your heart on them.

3. For Your loving-kindness is better than life; my lips give praise to You.

4. So I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.

14. which my lips have opened, and my mouth has spoken in my trouble.

## Psalms 69

1.  To the chief musician. Concerning the Lilies. Of David. Save me, O God, for the waters have come in to my soul.

2. I sink in deep mire, and there is no standing; I have come into deep waters where the floods overflow me.

3. I am weary from my crying, my throat is scorched; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.

4. They who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they who would destroy me are mighty, my lying enemies; then I restored what I did not take by violence.

5. O God, You know my foolishness, and my guiltiness is not hidden from You.

6. O Jehovah of hosts, do not let those who wait on You be ashamed for my sake; let not the ones who seek You be ashamed for my sake, O God of Israel.

7. Because I suffered reproach for Your sake, shame has covered my face.

8. I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother's children.

9. For the zeal of Your house has consumed Me; and the reproaches of the ones who reproach You have fallen on Me.

10. When I humbled my soul with fasting, it also was to my reproach;

11. I also made sackcloth my clothing, and I became a mockery to them.

12. They who sit in the gate spoke of me; and I was the song of drunkards.   

13. But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Jehovah, at a time of favor, O God! in the plentitude of Your mercy answer me, in the truth of Your salvation.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, that I may not sink; let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Let not the flood waters overflow me, nor let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut its mouth on me.

16. Hear me, O Jehovah, for Your mercy is good; in the plentitude of Your tender mercies, turn toward me.

17. And do not hide Your face from Your servant; for I am distressed; hear me quickly;

18. draw near my soul; redeem it; ransom me because of my enemies.

19. You know my reproach and my shame, and my dishonor; my enemies are all before You.

20. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am faint; and I waited for one to show pity, but there was no one; and for comforters, but I found none.

21. They also gave Me gall in my food; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.   

22. Let their table be a trap before them, and to those at ease a snare.

23. Let their eyes be darkened from seeing, and cause their loins to quiver continually.

24. Pour out Your wrath on them; and let the glow of Your anger overtake them.

25. Let their home be made desolate; let no one dwell in their tents.

26. For whom You have stricken, they have persecuted; and they gossip to the pain of those You pierced.

27. Put iniquity to their iniquity, and do not let them enter into Your righteousness.

28. Blot them out from the Book of Life; yea, let them not be written with the righteous.

29. But I am poor and in pain; O God, Your salvation shall set me on high.   

30. I will praise God's name in a song; and I will magnify Him with thanks.

31. And it shall please Jehovah more than bulls, horned or hoofed bull.

32. The humble have seen and are glad; you who seek God, your heart shall live.

33. For Jehovah hears the needy, and He does not despise His prisoners.

34. Let the heavens and the earth praise Him; the seas, and everything that moves in them.

35. For God will save Zion; and He will build the cities of Judah, and they shall live there and possess it.

36. And His servants' seed shall inherit; and they who love His name shall live in it.  

## Psalms 70

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O God, deliver me! Hurry, O Jehovah, to help me!

2. Let those who seek after my soul be ashamed and turned pale; let them be turned backward and shamed, those who desire my evil.

3. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame, those who say, Aha, aha!

4. Let all those who seek You rejoice, and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation forever say, Let God be magnified.

5. But I am poor and needy, come quickly to me, O God; You are my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, do not wait any longer.  

## Psalms 71

1. I put my trust in You, O Jehovah, let me not be put to shame forever.

2. In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; bow down Your ear to me and save me.

3. Be a rock of strength for me, to which I may always go; You have given a command to save me; for You are my rock and my fortress.

4. O my God, deliver me out of the hand of the wicked, and out of the palm of the unjust and the ruthless.

5. For You are my hope, O Lord Jehovah, my trust from my youth.

6. I have rested on You from the belly; You are He who took me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of You.

7. I am like a wonder to many, but You are my strong tower.

8. My mouth is filled with Your praise, with your glory all the day long.

9. Do not cast me off now at the time of my old age. Do not forsake me when my strength fails.

10. For my enemies speak against me; and those who lurk for my soul plot together.

11. And they say, God has forsaken him; pursue him and take him, for there is no one to deliver.

12. O God, do not be far from me; Oh my God come quickly to help me.

13. Let them be ashamed; let those who are enemies of my soul be consumed; let them be covered with reproach, and let those seeking evil for me be dishonored;   

14. and I will hope without ceasing, and I will add more on all Your praise.

15. My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness and Your salvation all the day; for I do not know the numbers.

16. I will come in the strength of the lord Jehovah; I will speak of Your righteousness, of Yours alone.

17. O God, You have taught me from my youth; and until now I have declared Your wonders.

18. And now that I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not leave me until I have manifested Your strength to the generation, Your power to everyone who is to come.

19. And, Your righteousness, O God, is to the heights, You who have done great things. O God, who is like You?

20. Who has shown me great and evil distresses; You will turn me ; You will make me live; and You will bring me up from the depths of the earth.

21. You will multiply my greatness and surround and comfort me.

22. I will also thank You with a harp, O my God; I will sing Your truth; I will sing to You with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips shall shout for joy, for I will sing praise to You; also my soul which you have redeemed.

24. And my tongue shall muse on Your righteousness all the day; because those seeking my evil are disgraced; they are put to shame.  

## Psalms 72

1.  Of Solomon. Give the King Your judgments, O God; and Your righteousness to the King's son.   

2. Your people He shall judge in righteousness, and Your poor in justice.

3. The mountains will lift up peace to the people; and the little hills through righteousness.

4. He shall judge the poor of the people; and He shall save the sons of the needy; and He shall crush the oppressor.

5. They shall fear You with the sun, and before the moon in all generations.

6. He shall descend like rain on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.

7. In His days the righteous shall flourish, and plenty of peace, till the moon is not.

8. He shall also rule from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

9. Those dwelling in the desert will bow before Him, and His enemies will lick the dust.

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

11. Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him.

12. For He shall save the needy who cries, and the poor with no helper.

13. He shall have pity on the poor and needy; and He saves the souls of the needy ones.

14. He shall redeem their souls from oppression and violence; and their blood shall be precious in His eyes.

15. And He shall live, and the gold of Sheba shall be given to Him; and prayer shall be made for Him continually; He shall bless Him all the day long.

16. A fullness of grain shall be in the earth on top of the mountains; its fruit shall shake like Lebanon; and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.

17. His name shall be forever; His name shall continue before the sun; and they shall bless themselves by Him; all nations shall call Him blessed.   

18. Blessed is Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things.

19. And blessed is His glorious name forever; and the whole earth is filled with His glory! Amen and amen!

20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse have ended.  

## Psalms 73

1.  A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are of a pure heart.

2. And as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps nearly made to slip.

3. For I was jealous of the proud; I looked upon the peace of the wicked.

4. For there are no pangs to their death; but their body is fat.

5. They are not in the misery of mortal man; and with men they are not touched.

6. So pride enchains them; violence covers them like a robe.

7. Their eyes go out with fatness; they have passed the imaginations of the heart.

8. They scoff and speak in malice; from on high they speak cruelty.

9. They set their mouth in the heavens; and their tongues walk through the earth.

10. Because of this His people shall return here; and waters of a full cup shall be drained by them.

11. And they say, How does God know? And, Is there knowledge in the Most High?

12. Behold! These are the ungodly who are always at ease; they increase their riches.

13. Surely I have purified my heart in vain; and I have washed my hands in innocence.

14. For all the day long I was touched; and my chastening is at the mornings.   

15. If I say, This is the way I will speak; behold, I would deceive a generation of Your sons.

16. And although I thought, that I might understand this, it was painful in my eyes,

17. until I went into the sanctuary of God; now I understood their end.

18. Surely, You will set their feet in slippery places; You will make them fall into ruin.

19. How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away with terrors!

20. Like a dream at the time from dreaming, O Lord, in awaking You will despise their image.   

21. For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pierced in my reins.

22. And I was brutish and did not know; I was like animals with You.

23. Yet I was continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand.

24. You shall guide me by Your counsel; and afterward You will take me to glory.

25. Whom have I in Heaven? And I have no desire on earth besides You.

26. My flesh and my heart waste away; God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.

27. For, lo, those who are far from You shall be lost; You have cut off all who go whoring away from You.

28.  As for me, it is good for me to draw near to God; I have made my refuge in the Lord Jehovah, to declare all Your works.  

## Psalms 74

1.  A Lesson, of Asaph. O God, have You cast us off forever; will Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?

2. Remember Your congregation; You purchased them in days before; You redeemed us as the rod of Your inheritance, this Mount Zion in which You have dwelt.

3. Lift up Your steps to the perpetual desolations, the enemy who has done all evil in the sanctuary.

4. Your vexers have roared in the middle of Your congregation; they set up their own signs for signs.

5. He is known as one bringing axes in on high, against the thick trees.

6. And now together they break down its carved work with the axe and hammers.

7. They have cast fire in Your sanctuary; they have polluted the place where Your name dwells on the earth.

8. They said in their hearts, Let us rage against them together; they have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.

9. We did not see our signs; there is no longer a prophet; nor any among us who knows until when.

10. O God, until when shall the enemy defame You ? Shall the enemy scorn Your name forever?

11. Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? From out of Your bosom, consume them .   

12. For God is my King of old, who works salvation in the midst of the land.

13. You broke the sea by Your strength; You burst the heads of sea-monsters in the waters.

14. You cracked open the heads of leviathan; You gave him to be food for the people of the wilderness.

15. You divided the fountain and the torrent; You dried up mighty rivers.

16. The day is Yours, the night is also Yours. You have established the light and the sun.

17. You have fixed the boundaries of the earth; You have formed the summer and winter.   

18. Remember this: the enemy has defamed, O Jehovah; and a foolish people have scorned Your name.

19. Do not give the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beasts; You will not forever forget the life of Your afflicted ones.

20. Look to Your covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full, the abodes of violence.

21. O let not the ill-treated ones turn back ashamed; let the poor and needy praise Your name.

22. Arise, O God, contend for Your cause; remember Your reproach from the fool all the day.

23. Do not forget the voice of Your enemies; the noise of those rising up against You is going up continually.  

## Psalms 75

1.  To the chief musician. Do not destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. We have given thanks to You, O God; we have given thanks; for Your name is near; Your wonderful works have been told.

2. When I take the appointed time, I shall judge in uprightness.

3. The earth and all of its inhabitants are melting away; I set firm its pillars. Selah.

4. I said to the boastful, Do not boast; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn.

5. Do not lift up your horn on high; do not speak with a stiff neck.   

6. For exaltations are not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert;

7. but God is the judge; He puts down this one and lifts up this other .

8. For a cup is in the hand of Jehovah; and the wine foams; it is fully mixed, and He pours out from it; surely all the wicked of the earth must drain its dregs and drink.

9. But I will witness forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. And I will cut off all the horns of the wicked; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.  

## Psalms 76

1.  To the chief musician. For stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song of Praise. God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.

2. And His abode is in Salem; and His dwelling-place in Zion.

3. There He broke the fiery arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

4. You are glorious, more excellent than the mountains of prey.

5. The stouthearted have been stripped; they slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.

6. By Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the horse and chariot have sunk into a sleep.   

7. You, even You, are terrifying; and who can stand before You when You are angry?

8. You have caused judgment to be heard from Heaven; the earth feared and was stilled;

9. when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

10. For the wraths of man thank You; You encircle Yourself with the wraths left over.

11. Vow and pay to Jehovah your God; let all that are around Him bring presents to the Fearful One.

12. He shall cut off the spirit in princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.  

## Psalms 77

1.  To the chief musician. On Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. My voice is to God, and I cry; my voice is to God, and He listened to me.

2. In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; my hand was open in the night and did not grow numb; my soul refused to be comforted.

3. I remember God and am troubled; I meditate and my spirit faints. Selah.

4. You seized the watches of my eyes; I am troubled, and I cannot speak.

5. I thought upon the days of old, the years of bygone ages.

6. I will remember my song in the night; I will speak with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.

7. Will the lord cast off forever; and will He not add to be pleased any more?

8. Is His mercy gone forever? Has His word failed for all generations?

9. Has God forgotten to be gracious; has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah.

10. And I said, This is my sickness, the years of the right hand of the Most High;   

11. I will remember the works of Jehovah; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.

12. I will also meditate on all Your works and muse of Your doings.

13. O God, your way is in holiness; who is a God great like God?

14. You are the God who does wonders; You have revealed Your strength among the peoples.

15. You have redeemed Your people with Your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

16. The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You; they were afraid; yea, the deeps trembled.

17. The clouds poured out water; the skies uttered a voice; and Your arrows flew out.

18. The voice of Your thunder in the tempest; lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked!

19. Your way is in the sea; and Your path is in the great waters; and Your footsteps are not known.

20. You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.  

## Psalms 78

1.  A Lesson of Asaph. O my people, listen to my law; bow your ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will pour forth dark sayings of old,

3. those which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

4. We will not hide them from their sons; to declare to the coming generation the praises of Jehovah; yea, His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.

5. For he raised a testimony in Jacob, and set a law in Israel; which he commanded our fathers, to teach them to their sons;

6. So that a coming generation may know; sons shall be born; they shall rise up and tell their sons,

7. so that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments.

8. And they shall not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that prepared not its heart; yea, whose spirit was not faithful with God.   

9. The sons of Ephraim, armed shooters of bows, turned back in the day of battle.

10. They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to walk in His law.

11. And they forgot His works and His wonders which He had shown them;

12. He did wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea and passed them through; and He caused the waters to stand in a heap.

14. And He led them by a cloud in the day, and all the night with a light of fire.

15. He split the rocks in the wilderness and made them drink, as from great floods.

16. And He brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like torrents.

17. Yet they sinned still more against Him, to provoke the Most High in the desert.

18. And they tested God in their heart, by asking food for their souls.

19. And they spoke against God, saying, Shall God be able to set a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold! He struck the rock and the waters gushed out, and the torrents overflowed. Can He also give bread? Will He provide flesh for His people?

21. So Jehovah heard and He was made furious; and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and also anger went up against Israel,

22. because they did not believe in God and trusted not in His salvation.

23. And He commanded the fine clouds above; and He opened the doors of the heavens;

24. and He rained on them manna to eat; and He gave the grain of the heavens to them.

25. Man ate the bread of the mighty; He sent them food to the full.

26. He made an east wind blow in the heavens; and He led out the south wind by His power.

27. Yea, He rained flesh on them like dust, and winged birds as the sand of the seas.

28. And He made them fall amidst their camp, all around to their tents.

29. They ate and were filled full; for their own lust He brought to them.

30. They were not estranged from their lust; their food was still in their mouths,

31. and God's wrath came on them and killed the fattest of them; and He struck down the choice ones of Israel.

32. In all this they sinned still, and did not believe in His wonderful works;

33. and He ended their days in vanity, and their years in sudden terror.

34. When He killed them, then they sought Him; and they turned and searched for God.

35. So they remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their Redeemer.

36. But they flattered Him with their mouths, and with their tongues lied to Him.

37. For their heart was not steadfast with Him; and they were not faithful in His covenant.

38. But He being merciful atoned for iniquity and did not destroy; and He added to turn away His anger, and did not stir up all his wrath.

39. For He remembered that they were flesh, a breath passing away, and not returning.   

40. How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness, angering Him in the desert!

41. Yea, they turned back and tested God, and pained the Holy One of Israel.

42. They did not remember His hand, on the day He redeemed them from the enemy;

43. who set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan.

44. He turned their rivers into blood, also their streams that they might not drink.

45. He sent swarms of flies against them, and they devoured them; also frogs, and they destroyed them.

46. He also gave their crops to the stripping locust, and their labor to the locust.

47. He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with sleet.

48. He gave their cattle up to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.

49. He sent the heat of His anger on them, fury and indignation and distress, a sending of angels of evils.

50. He leveled a path for His anger; He did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague.

51. And he struck all the first-born in Egypt, the firstfruits of strength in the tents of Ham;

52. and He led His people forth like sheep; and He led them like a flock in the wilderness.

53. And he led them on safely, and they did not fear; but the sea flooded over their enemies.

54. He brought them to the border of His holy place; this mountain that His right hand had gained.

55. And He cast out the nations before them; and by a line He made a possession fall to them; and He made the tribes of Israel to live in their tents.

56. Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God; and they did not keep His testimonies;

57. but they turned back and betrayed, like their fathers; they veered aside like a deceitful bow.

58. For they enraged Him with their high places; and they provoked Him to jealousy with their molten images.

59. When God heard, He was angry, and He utterly rejected Israel.

60. And He left the tabernacle of Shiloh; the tent He dwelt in among men;

61. and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy's hands.

62. And He gave His people to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.

63. The fire burned up their young men; and their virgins were not praised.

64. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows were not able to weep.

65. Then the Lord awoke, as one asleep, like a mighty man rejoicing with wine.

66. And He drove His enemies backward; He put them to a never-ending shame.

67. And He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and He did not elect the tribe of Ephraim;

68. But He chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which He loved.

69. And He built His sanctuary like high places, like the earth He has founded forever.

70. He also chose His servant David, and took him from the sheepfolds;

71. He brought him in from the suckling ewes ; He brought him to feed His people Jacob, and His inheritance, Israel.

72. And he fed them in the integrity of his heart; and guided them in the skillfulness of his hands.  

## Psalms 79

1.  A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

2. They have given the bodies of Your servants as food for the birds of the heavens; the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.

3. They have shed their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one burying.

4. We have become a shame to our neighbors a scorn and a mockery to those who are around us.

5. Until when, O Jehovah? Will You be angry with us forever? Shall Your jealousy burn like fire?   

6. Pour out Your wrath on the nations who have not known You, and on the kingdoms who have not called on Your name.

7. For they have eaten up Jacob, and laid waste to his dwelling-place.

8. Oh do not remember for us the sins of our first ones; let Your tender mercies meet us speedily, for we have been brought very low.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the matter of the glory of Your name; and deliver us and atone for our sins, for Your name's sake.

10. Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let Him be known among the nations before our eyes, the avenging of the blood of Your servants that has been poured out.

11. Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your arm, preserve the sons of death.

12. And reward our neighbors sevenfold, Give into their bosom their curse with which they have cursed You, O Lord.

13. Then we Your people, and sheep of Your pasture, will give thanks to You forever; we will declare Your praise to all generations.  

## Psalms 80

1.  To the chief musician. A Testimony. Concerning the Lilies. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You leading Joseph like a flock; shine forth, You dwelling between the cherubs.

2. Stir up Your might before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, and come for salvation.

3. O God, turn us again, and make Your face shine, and we will be saved!

4. O Jehovah God of Hosts, until when will You smoke against the prayer of Your people?

5. You made them eat with the bread of tears; yea, You made them drink with tears a third time.

6. You make us a strife for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh to themselves.

7. O God of hosts, turn us again, and cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.   

8. You have led a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations, and have planted it.

9. You cleared before it, and You have rooted its roots; and it has filled the land.

10. The hills were covered with its shadow; and its boughs were as the cedars of God.

11. It was sending its boughs out to the sea, and its branches to the River.

12. Why have You broken down its walls, so that it is plucked by all who pass by the way?

13. A boar out of the forest wastes it, and the beast of the field feeds on it.

14. O God of hosts, we beg You, return! Look down from Heaven and see and visit this vine,

15. and the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and on the Son You made strong for Yourself.

16.  It is burned with fire, cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Your face.

17. Let Your hand be on the Man of Your right hand; on the Son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.

18. So we will not backslide from You; make us live, and we will call on Your name.

19. O Jehovah, God of hosts, turn us again! Cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved.  

## Psalms 81

1.  To the chief musician. On Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob.

2. Lift up a song, and the timbrel, the pleasing lyre with the harp.

3. Blow the ram's horn in the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.

4. For this was a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

5. This He ordained as a testimony in Joseph, when He went out over the land of Egypt; I heard a lip I did not understand.

6. I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.

7. You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.   

8. My people, listen, and I will testify against you, whether you will listen to Me:

9. There shall be no strange god among you; nor shall you worship a foreign god.

10. I am Jehovah your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But My people would not listen to My voice, and Israel did not consent to Me.

12. So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their own hearts; they walked in their own conceits.

13. Oh if My people had listened to me! If Israel had walked in My ways,

14. I would have subdued their enemies in a little; and I would have turned My hand against their foes.

15. the haters of Jehovah shall be found untrue to Him, and their time is forever.

16. Yea, He would have caused them to eat from the fat of the wheat; and I would have satisfied you with honey out of the rock.  

## Psalms 82

1.  A Psalm of Asaph God stands in the assembly of God; He judges in the midst of the gods.

2. Until when will you judge unjustly, and lift up the faces of the wicked? Selah.

3. Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.

4. Deliver the poor and needy; save out of the hand of the wicked.

5. They neither know nor will understand; they walk in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.   

6. I have said, You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High.

7. But you shall die as men, and fall like one of the rulers.

8. Rise, O God, judge the earth; for You shall inherit in all the nations.  

## Psalms 83

1.  A Song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God do not keep silence to Yourself; do not be speechless; yea, do not be still, O God.

2. For lo, Your enemies are roaring; and those who hate You have lifted up their head.

3. They take shrewd counsel against Your people; they plot against Your hidden ones.

4. They have said, Come, and we will cut them off from being a nation; and, The name of Israel will not be recalled again.

5. For they plotted to together with one heart; they have cut a covenant against You;

6.  even the tents of Edom, and of the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagarites;

7. Gebal and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.

8. Also Assyria has joined with them; they were an arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.   

9. Do to them as to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin at the torrent Kishon.

10. At Endor they were destroyed; they became dung for the ground.

11. Make their nobles as Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;

12. who said, Let us take possession of God's pastures for ourselves.

13. O my God, make them as whirling dust, as the stubble before the wind.

14. As the fire burns a forest, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,

15. so pursue them with Your tempest, and frighten them with Your storm.

16. Fill their faces with shame and they will seek Your name, O Jehovah.

17. Let them be ashamed and terrified for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish.

18. And let them know Your name is Jehovah, that You alone are the Most High over all the earth.  

## Psalms 84

1.  To the chief musician. On Gittith. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How lovely are Your dwellings, O Jehovah of hosts!

2. My soul longs and even faints for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.

3. Even the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, on Your altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.

4. Blessed are they who dwell in Your house; they will always be praising You.

5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in You; Your ways are in their hearts.

6. Passing through the valley of weeping, they will make it a fountain; even the early rain covers with blessings.

7. They go from strength to strength, being seen in Zion before God.   

8. O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; listen, O God of Jacob. Selah.

9. Behold, O God, our shield; and look upon the face of Your anointed.

10. For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand; I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For Jehovah God is a sun and shield; Jehovah will give grace and glory; He will withhold nothing good from those who walk in integrity.

12. O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in You!  

## Psalms 85

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. O Jehovah, You have been gracious to Your land; You have turned back the captivity of Jacob.

2. You have taken away the iniquity of Your people; You covered all of their sins. Selah.

3. You gathered all of Your wrath; You turned from the heat of Your anger.

4. O God of our salvation, turn us, and break up Your anger with us.

5. Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?

6. Will You give us life anew, so that Your people may rejoice in You?

7. Cause us to see Your mercy, O Jehovah, and give us Your salvation.   

8. I will hear what Jehovah God will say; for He will speak peace to His people, and His saints; but let them not turn again to folly.

9. Surely His salvation is near to fearers of Him, for glory to dwell in our land.

10. Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace kissed each other .

11. Truth shall sprout out of the earth, and righteousness looks down from Heaven.

12. Yea, Jehovah shall give good, and our land shall give its produce.

13. Righteousness shall go before Him and shall make a way for His footsteps.  

## Psalms 86

1.  A Prayer of David O Jehovah, bow down Your ear, answer me, for I am poor and needy.

2. Guard my soul, for I am godly; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.

3. Be gracious to Me, O Lord, for I cry to You daily.

4. Give joy to the soul of Your servant; for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

5. For You, O Lord, are good and ready to forgive, and rich in mercy to all who call on You.

6. O Lord, give ear to my prayer; listen to my voice of supplications.

7. I will call on You in the day of my trouble, for You will answer me.   

8. None among the gods is like You, O Lord, and none are like Your works.

9. All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You; yea, Lord, they shall glorify Your name.

10. For You are great and do wonderful things; You alone are God.

11. Teach me Your way, O Jehovah; I will walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.

12. With all my heart I will thank You, O Lord my God; and I will glorify Your name forevermore.

13. For Your mercy toward me is great; and You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

14. O God, the proud have risen against me; and the troop of the violent have sought after my life, and have not set You before their eyes.

15. But You, O God, are God, full of pity; and gracious, longsuffering and rich in mercy and truth.

16. O turn to me and be gracious to me; give Your strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your handmaid.

17. Show me a token for good, that those who hate me may see and be ashamed, O Jehovah, because You have helped me and comforted me.  

## Psalms 87

1.  For the Sons of Korah. A Psalm. A Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2. Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the tents of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.   

4. I will mention Rahab and Babylon to those who know me; behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia; this man was born there.

5. And it shall be said to Zion, This man and that man was born in her; and the Highest Himself shall establish her.

6. In recording the peoples Jehovah shall mark down, This man was born there. Selah.

7. And the singers, the players of the pipe: all my springs are in You.  

## Psalms 88

1.  A Song. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah, to the chief musician on Mahalath, to make humble. A Poem of Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah God of my salvation, I have cried in the day, in the night before You.

2. Let my prayer come before You; bow down Your ear to my cry.

3. For my soul is full with evils, and my life touches Sheol.

4. I am counted with those who go down to the Pit; I have been like a feeble man,

5. free among the dead, as pierced ones lying in the grave, whom You remember no more; yea by Your hand they are cut off.

6. You have laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places; in the deeps.

7. Your fury has lain hard upon me, and You afflict me with all Your waves. Selah.

8. You have taken my friends away from me; You have made me a hateful thing to them; I am shut up, I will not go out.

9. My eye mourns because of affliction; O Jehovah, I have called on You every day; I have spread out my hands to You.   

10. For will You do wonders to the dead? Or shall the departed spirits rise and thank You? Selah.

11. Shall Your mercy be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness amidst ruin?

12. Shall Your wonders be known in the dark, and Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

13. But to You I have cried, O Jehovah; and in the morning my prayer shall go before You.

14. O Jehovah, why do You cast off my soul; why do You hide Your face from me?

15. I am afflicted and dying from childhood; I suffer Your terrors; I am distracted.

16. Your fierce wrath goes over me; Your terrors have cut me off.

17. They surrounded me like waters all the day long; they have come together around me.

18. You have taken lover and friend far from me, he who knows me, into darkness.  

## Psalms 89

1.  A Poem of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of Jehovah forever; I will declare with my mouth Your faithfulness to all generations.

2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever; You shall establish Your faithfulness in the heavens.

3. I have cut a covenant with My chosen; I have sworn to David My servant,

4. I will establish Your seed forever, and build up Your throne to all generations. Selah.   

5. And the heavens shall thank Your wonders, O Jehovah; also Your faithfulness in the assembly of the saints.

6. For who in the sky shall be ranked with Jehovah, who among the sons of the mighty is like Jehovah?

7. God is greatly to be feared in the congregation of the saints, and to be adored by all around Him.

8. O Jehovah God of hosts, who is a strong Jehovah like You? And Your faithfulness is all around You.

9. You rule the pride of the sea; when its waves rise high, You still them.

10. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one slain; You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.

11. The heavens are Yours, and the earth is Yours; the world and its fullness, You founded them.

12. You have created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name.

13. You have a mighty arm; Your hand is strong, Your right hand is high.

14. Justice and righteousness are Your throne's foundation; mercy and truth go before Your face.   

15. Blessed is the people knowing the joyful sound; O Jehovah, they shall walk in the light of Your face.

16. They shall rejoice in Your name always; and they are exalted in Your righteousness.

17. For You are the glory of their strength; and by Your favor You lift up our horn.

18. For Jehovah is our shield, yea, the Holy One of Israel our King.   

19. Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one; and You said, I have laid help on a mighty one. I have exalted a chosen one from the people.

20. I have found My servant David; I have anointed him with My holy oil.

21. My hand shall be fixed with him; and My arm shall make him strong.

22. An enemy will not exact against him; nor the son of iniquity afflict him.

23. And I will beat down his foes before him, and plague those hating him.

24. But My faithfulness and My mercy is with him; and his horn shall be exalted in My name.

25. And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.

26. He shall cry to Me, My Father, You are My God, and the rock of my salvation.

27. And I will make him My first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.

28. I will keep My mercy for Him forever, and My covenant shall hold fast with Him.

29. And I have established his Seed forever, and His throne as the days of the heavens.

30. If his children forsake My law and do not walk in My judgments;

31. if they profane My statutes and do not keep My commandments;

32. then I will visit their transgressions with the rod, and their sins with stripes.

33. But I will not annul My mercy from him, and I will not be false in My faithfulness.

34. I will not profane My covenant, nor change what goes from My lips.

35. Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David.

36. His seed shall be forever, and his throne as the sun before Me.

37. Like the moon, it shall be forever; and a faithful witness in the sky. Selah.   

38. But You have cast off and rejected us ; You have been angry with Your anointed.

39. You have turned away from the covenant of your servant; You have defiled his crown on the ground.

40. You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

41. All who pass by the way plunder him; he is a curse to his neighbors.

42. You have set up the right hand of his enemies; You have made all his enemies rejoice.

43. And you have turned back the edge of his sword, and have not held him up in battle.

44. You have made his glory to cease and have hurled his throne to the ground.

45. You have shortened the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah.

46. O Jehovah, until when will You hide Yourself? Shall Your wrath burn like fire forever?

47. Remember, I pray, the time of life; for what vanity have you created all the sons of men?

48. What man lives and never sees death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of Sheol? Selah.

49. Lord, where are Your former kindnesses that You swore to David in Your faithfulness?

50. Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, my bearing in my bosom the insults of the many peoples;

51.  with which Your enemies have cursed, O Jehovah; with which they have cursed the footsteps of Your anointed.

52. Blessed be Jehovah forever. Amen and amen!  

## Psalms 90

1.  A Prayer of Moses, the Man of God. O Lord, You have been our dwelling-place in all generations.

2. Before the mountains were born, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting You are God.

3. You turn man to dust, and say, Return, O sons of men.

4. For a thousand years in Your eyes are as yesterday when it passes, and as a watch in the night.

5. You flooded them away; they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass growing;

6. in the morning it sprouts and shoots up; in the evening it withers and dries up.   

7. For we are consumed by Your anger, and we are troubled by Your wrath.

8. You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your face.

9. For all our days pass away in Your wrath; we finish our years like a murmur.

10. The days of our years are seventy; and if any by strength live eighty years, yet their pride is labor and vanity; for it soon passes, and we fly away.

11. Who knows the power of Your anger? And as Your fear is, so is Your fury.   

12. So teach us to number our days, so that we may bring a heart of wisdom.

13. Return, O Jehovah! Until when? And give pity to Your servants.

14. O satisfy us in the morning with Your mercy, and we will be glad and rejoice all our days.

15. Make us glad according to the days of our affliction, the years in which we have seen evil.

16. Let Your work appear to Your servants, and Your majesty to their sons.

17. And let the delight of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish the works of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands, establish it!  

## Psalms 91

1. He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shade of the Almighty.

2. I will say to Jehovah: My Refuge and my Fortress, my God; I will trust in Him.

3. For He delivers you from the fowler's trap, from destruction's plague.

4. With His feathers He will cover you, and under His wings you shall seek refuge; His truth is a shield and buckler.

5. You shall not fear the terror of night, of the arrow that flies by day;

6. of the plague that walks in darkness, of the destruction laying waste at noonday.

7. A thousand shall fall by your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; it shall not come near you.

8. Only with your eyes you shall look, and see the reward of the wicked.   

9. Because You, O Jehovah, are My refuge; if you make the Most High your habitation,

10. no evil shall happen to You, nor shall any plague come near Your tent.

11. For He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You in all Your ways.

12. They shall bear You up in their hands, that You not dash Your foot on a stone.

13. You shall tread on the lion and adder; the young lion and the serpent You shall trample under foot.

14. Because he has set his love on Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set Him on high because He has known My name.

15. He shall call on Me and I will answer Him; I will be with Him in distress; I will rescue Him and honor Him.

16. I will satisfy him with length of days and will make him see My salvation.  

## Psalms 92

1.  A Psalm, A Song for the Sabbath Day. It is good to give thanks to Jehovah, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;

2. to make Your mercy known in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night;

3. on the ten strings , and on the harp; on the lyre with sounding music.

4. For You have rejoiced me with Your work, O Jehovah; I will shout in the works of Your hands.

5. O Jehovah, Your purposes are very deep. How great are Your works!

6. An animal-like man does not know; a fool does not understand this.   

7. When the wicked flourish like grass, and all the evildoers blossom, it is for them to be destroyed forever.

8. But You, O Jehovah, are exalted forever.

9. For, lo, Your enemies, O Jehovah; for, lo, Your enemies shall perish; all the evildoers shall be scattered.

10. But You will lift up my horn as the wild ox, and I will be anointed with fresh oil.

11. And my eye shall look on my enemies; my ears shall hear the evildoers who rise up against me.

12. The righteous shall flourish as the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13. Those planted in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of our God, shall flourish.

14. They shall bear fruit in old age; they shall be fat and fresh,

15. to declare that Jehovah is upright, my Rock! And in Him is no evil.  

## Psalms 93

1. Jehovah reigns! He is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; He girded Himself; and the world is established; it shall not be shaken.

2. Your throne is established from then; You are from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up; O Jehovah, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods have lifted their roaring waves.

4. Jehovah on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, than the mighty waves of the sea.

5. Your testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes Your house to length of days, O Jehovah.  

## Psalms 94

1. O Jehovah, God of vengeance; O God of vengeance, shine forth!

2. Lift up Yourself, O judge of the earth; give a just repayment on the proud.

3. Until when shall the wicked, O Jehovah, until when shall the wicked exult?

4. They gush, they speak impudent things; all the workers of evil speak proudly.

5. O Jehovah, they crush Your people and afflict Your inheritance.

6. They kill the widow and the stranger, and murder the orphan.

7. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see, nor shall the God of Jacob observe.

8. Understand you beastly ones among the people; yea, you fools, when will you be wise?

9. He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see?

10. He who chastises the nations, shall He not punish, He who teaches man knowledge?

11. Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, that they are vain.   

12. Blessed is the man You chasten, O Jehovah, You teach him out of Your law;

13. to give him rest from troubled days, until the pit is dug for the wicked.

14. For Jehovah will not leave His people; nor will He forsake His inheritance.

15. For judgment shall turn to righteousness; and all the upright in heart shall follow after it.

16. Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of evil?

17. Unless Jehovah had been my help, my soul would almost have dwelt in silence.

18. If I said, My foot slides, O Jehovah, Your mercy has held me up.

19. In the multitude of my inward thoughts, Your comforts delight my soul.

20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with You, devising mischief for a statute?

21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the blood of the innocent.

22. But Jehovah is my tower of defense; and my God is the rock of my refuge.

23. And He shall turn their own iniquity upon them; and He shall cut them off in their evil, Jehovah our God shall cut them off!  

## Psalms 95

1. O come, let us sing to Jehovah; let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation.

2. Let us come before His face with praise; let us shout for joy to Him with songs.

3. For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

4. The deep places of the earth are in His hand; the summits of the mountains also are His.

5. The sea is His, and He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.

6. O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.   

7. For He is our God; and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice,

8. do not harden your heart as in the day of strife, as in the day of testing in the wilderness;

9. When your fathers tempted Me, they tested Me and they saw My work.

10. For forty years I was disgusted with this generation; and I said, They are a people who err in heart; and, They do not know My ways,

11. to whom I swore in My anger, They shall not enter into My rest.  

## Psalms 96

1. O sing to Jehovah a new song; sing to Jehovah, all the earth.

2. Sing to Jehovah; bless His name, bear news of His salvation day by day.

3. Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonders among all people.

4. For Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.

5. For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but Jehovah made the heavens.

6. Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.

7. Give to Jehovah, O families of the people; give to Jehovah glory and might.

8. Give to Jehovah the glory due His name; bring an offering and come in to His courts.

9. Oh worship Jehovah in the beauty of holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.   

10. Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns; and, The world shall be established, it shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.

11. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it.

12. Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it; then the trees of the forest shall rejoice

13. before Jehovah; for He comes; for He comes to judge the earth; He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His faithfulness.  

## Psalms 97

1. Jehovah reigns! Let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of islands be glad.

2. Clouds and darkness are all around Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.

3. A fire goes before Him and burns up His enemies all around.

4. His lightnings lit up the world; the earth saw and trembled.

5. The mountains melted like wax before the face of Jehovah, before the face of Jehovah of the whole earth.

6. The heavens declare His righteousness and all the people see His glory.

7. All who serve graven images are shamed, those who boast themselves in idols; all gods bow down before Him.   

8. Zion heard and was glad; yea, the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O Jehovah.

9. For You, Jehovah, are exalted above all the earth; You are lifted on high far above all gods.

10. You who love Jehovah, hate evil. He keeps the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

12. Be glad in Jehovah, O righteous ones; give thanks to the memory of His holiness.  

## Psalms 98

4. Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth; break out and rejoice and sing praise.

5. Sing praise to Jehovah with the lyre; with the lyre and the voice of a song.

6. With trumpets and the sound of a horn, make a joyful noise before Jehovah the King.

7. Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it; the world, and those who live in it.

8. Let the rivers clap their hands; let the heights shout for joy together

9. before Jehovah; for He comes to judge the earth; with righteousness He shall judge the world, and the peoples in uprightness.  

## Psalms 99

1. Jehovah reigns; let the peoples tremble; He sits between the cherubs; let the earth quake.

2. Jehovah is great in Zion; and He is high above all the peoples.

3. They shall thank Your great and fearful name; it is holy.

4. The king's strength also loves judgment; You establish uprightness; You worked judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

5. Exalt Jehovah our God and worship at His footstool; He is holy.   

6. Moses and Aaron were among His priests; and Samuel was among those who called on His name; they called to Jehovah, and He answered them.

7. He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the law that He gave to them.

8. You answered them, O Jehovah our God; to them You were a God who forgives, but taking vengeance on their works.

9. Exalt Jehovah our God and worship at His holy hill; for Jehovah our God is holy.  

## Psalms 100

## Psalms 101

2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way; O when will You come to me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house.

3. I will set no wicked thing before my eyes; I have hated the work of those who turn aside; it shall not fasten upon me.

4. A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know evil.

5.  Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, I will cut him off; I will not endure him who has high eyes and a proud heart.

6. My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, so that they may dwell with me; he who walks in a perfect way shall serve me.

7.  He who works falsely shall not live inside my house; he who speaks lies shall not be established before my eyes.

8. In the mornings I will cut off all the wicked of the land, so that I may cut off all the evil workers from the city of Jehovah.  

## Psalms 102

1.  A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before Jehovah. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and let my cry come to You.

2. Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my trouble; bow down Your ear to me in the day I call; answer me quickly.

3. For my days are finished in smoke, and my bones glow like a firebrand.

4. My heart is stricken and dried like grass, so that I forget to eat my bread.

5. Because of the voice of my sighing, my bones cleave to my flesh.

6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.

7. I watch and am like a sparrow alone on the housetop.

8. My enemies curse me all the day long; those who rave against me have sworn against me.

9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and have mixed my drink with weeping;

10. because of Your anger and Your wrath; for You have lifted me and cast me down.

11. My days are like a shadow stretched out, and I wither like grass.   

12. But You, O Jehovah, shall dwell forever, and Your memory to generation and generation.

13. You shall arise; have mercy on Zion; for the time to pity her, yea, the appointed time has come.

14. For Your servants take pleasure in its stones, and pity its dust.

15. So nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth Your glory.

16. When Jehovah shall build up Zion, He shall appear in His glory.

17. He will turn to the prayer of the destitute, and will not despise their prayer.

18. This shall be written for the generation to come; and people to be created shall praise Jehovah.

19. For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; Jehovah looked from Heaven to the earth;

20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner, to set free the sons of death;

21. to declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem;

22. when the peoples and the kingdoms are gathered together to serve Jehovah.   

23. He diminished my strength in the way; He shortened my days.

24. I said, O my God, do not take me up in the half of my days; Your years are through the generation of generations.

25. You have laid the foundation of the earth of old; and the heavens are the work of Your hands.

26. They shall perish, but You shall endure; yea, all of them shall become old like a garment; You shall change them like clothing, and they shall be changed.

27. But You are He, and Your years shall not be ended.

28. The sons of Your servants shall dwell; and their seed shall be established before You.  

## Psalms 103

1.  Of David. Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all within me, bless His holy name.

2. Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all His rewards;

3. who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases;

4. who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with kindness and tender mercies;

5. who satisfies your desire with good; your youth is renewed like the eagle's.   

6. Jehovah works righteousness and judgments for all the oppressed.

7. He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel.

8. Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and of much mercy.

9. He will not always chasten, nor will He keep His anger forever.

10. He has not done to us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

11. For as the heavens are above the earth, so is His mercy mighty over those who fear Him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.

13. As the pity of a father over his sons, so Jehovah pities those who fear Him.

14. For He knows how we are made, remembering that we are dust.

15.  As for man, his days are as grass; as the flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16. For the wind passes over it, and it is not; and its place never knows it again.

17. But the mercy of Jehovah is from everlasting, even to everlasting, on those who fear Him; yea, His righteousness is to the sons of sons;

18. to those who keep His covenant, and to those who remember His commandments, to do them.   

19. Jehovah has prepared His throne in Heaven; and His kingdom rules over all.

20. Bless Jehovah, O angels of His; mighty in strength; doing His word; listening to the voice of His word.

21. Bless Jehovah, all His hosts, ministers of His, doing His will.

22. Bless Jehovah, all His works in all the places of His dominion; bless Jehovah, O my soul.  

## Psalms 104

1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! O Jehovah my God, You are very great; You have put on honor and majesty,

2. covering Yourself with light like a cloak, and stretching out the heavens like a curtain;

3. who lays beams in the waters of His upper rooms; setting thick clouds as His chariots; walking on the wings of the wind.

4. He makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire.

5. He founded the earth on its foundations; it shall not be shaken forever and ever.

6. You have covered the deep as with a robe; the waters stood above the mountains.

7. From Your rebuke, they flee; from the sound of Your thunder, they hurry away.

8. They go up the mountains; they go down the valleys to the place which You founded for them.

9. You have set a boundary they may not pass over; they shall not return to cover the earth.   

10.  He sends springs into the valleys; they flow between the hills;

11. they give drink to every animal of the field; wild asses break their thirst;

12. over them the birds of the heavens dwell; they give voice from between the branches.

13.  He waters the hills from His upper rooms; the earth is satisfied from the fruit of Your works.

14.  He causes the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for the service of man, to bring food out of the earth.

15. And wine cheers the heart of man; oil makes his face shine, and bread sustains the heart of man.

16. The trees of Jehovah are satisfied the cedars of Lebanon that He planted;

17. there where the birds nest; the fir trees are the house of the stork;

18. high hills are for the wild goats; rocks are a refuge for the badgers.   

19. He made the moon for seasons; the sun knows its going down.

20. You put darkness, and it is night; in it all the forest animals creep.

21. The young lions roar for prey, and to seek their food from God.

22. The sun rises; they are gathered, and go to their dens to lie down.

23. Man goes out to his work, and to his labor until the evening.

24. O Jehovah, how many are Your works! You have made all of them in wisdom; the earth is full of Your riches.

25. This is the sea, great and wide on both hands; there are creeping things even without number; living things, small and great.

26. There the ships go; You formed this great sea-animal to play in it.

27. All of them wait for You to give them their food in due season.

28. You give to them; they gather; You open Your hand, and they are filled with good.

29. You hide Your face, and they are troubled; You gather their breath, and they expire and return to their dust.

30. You send out Your Spirit, and they are created; and You renew the face of the earth.   

31. The glory of Jehovah shall be forever; Jehovah shall rejoice in His works.

32. He looks to the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke.

33. I will sing to Jehovah during my life; I will sing praise to my God while I exist.

34. My thoughts on Him shall be sweet; I will be glad in Jehovah.

35. Let sinners perish from the earth and let the wicked be no more; bless Jehovah, O my soul; praise Jehovah!  

## Psalms 105

1. O give thanks to Jehovah; call on His name; make His deeds known among the peoples.

2. Sing to Him; sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.

3. Glory in His holy name; let the heart of those who seek Jehovah rejoice.

4. Seek Jehovah and His strength; seek His face without ceasing.

5. Remember His wonders that He has done, His miracles, and the judgments of His mouth,

6. O seed of His servant Abraham; O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones,

7. He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth;   

8. He has remembered His covenant forever; the word He commanded to a thousand generations;

9. which He cut with Abraham, and His oath to Isaac;

10. and He established it to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for a perpetual covenant;

11. saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, the portion of your inheritance;

12. when they were a few men of number; very few, and strangers in it.

13. And they went about from nation to nation; from one kingdom to another people.

14. He allowed no man to oppress them; yea, He reproved kings for their sakes;

15.  saying , Touch not My anointed; and, Do My prophets no harm.

16. And He called a famine on the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.

17. He sent a man before them, Joseph, being sold for a slave;

18. they hurt his feet with chains; his soul came into iron;

19. until the time His word came, the word of Jehovah refined him;

20. the king, the ruler of peoples, sent and released him; even set him free;

21. he made him lord of his house, and ruler over all he owned;

22. to bind his leaders at his will, and to teach his elders wisdom.

23. Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. And He increased His people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies.   

25. He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.

26. He sent His servant Moses and Aaron whom He had chosen.

27. They put things of His signs among them; yea, miracles in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness and made it dark; and they did not rebel against His word.

29. He turned their waters into blood and killed their fish.

30. Their land swarmed with frogs in the rooms of their kings.

31. He spoke, and fly swarms came; gnats in all their borders.

32. He gave hail for their rain, flaming fire in their land.

33. He struck their vines also, and their fig trees; and He broke the trees of their borders.

34.  He spoke, and locusts came; and larvae without number;

35. and they ate up all the plants in the land; yea, ate the fruit of their ground.

36. He also struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruit of all their vigor.

37. And He led them out with silver and gold; and among their tribes, not one was stumbling.

38. Egypt was glad when they went out, for their dread had fallen on them.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.

40. He asked, and He brought quail; and satisfied them with the food from the heavens.

41. He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they went in the dry places like a river.

42. For He remembered His holy word and His servant Abraham;

43. and He brought His people out with joy; His chosen ones with gladness.

44. And He gave to them the lands of the nations; and they inherited the labor of the peoples;

45. so that they might observe His statutes and keep His laws. Praise Jehovah!  

## Psalms 106

1. Praise Jehovah! Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy endures forever.

2. Who can express the mighty deeds of Jehovah, or cause all His praise to be heard?

3. Blessed are those keeping judgment, he who does righteousness in every season.

4. Remember me, Jehovah, with the favor of Your people; O visit me with Your salvation,

5. to see the good of Your chosen ones to rejoice in the joy of Your nation, to glory with Your inheritance.   

6. We have sinned with our fathers; we did iniquity; we did wrong.

7. Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Egypt; they did not remember Your many mercies, and they rebelled at the sea, at the Sea of Reeds.

8. But He saved them for His name's sake, to make known His might.

9. And He rebuked the Sea of Reeds; and it dried up; and He made them go through the depths as through the wilderness.

10. And He saved them from the hand of the hater, and ransomed him from the hand of the enemy;

11. and waters covered their enemies; not one of them was left.

12. Then they believed His words; they sang His praise.   

13. They hurried and forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel;

14. and they greedily lusted in the wilderness, and tested God in the desert.

15. And He gave their request to them, but sent wasting into their soul.

16. And they were jealous of Moses the saint of Jehovah in the camp of Aaron;

17. the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; and covered the company of Abiram.

18. And a fire burned in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, and fell down before the casted image;

20. and they changed their Glory into the image of an ox eating grass.

21. They forgot God their deliverer, doing great things in Egypt;

22. wonders in the land of Ham; awesome things by the Sea of Reeds.

23. And He said to destroy them; except Moses His chosen one had stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath from destroying them .

24. They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His word.

25. And they murmured in their tents, not listening to the voice of Jehovah;

26. and He lifted up His hand to them, to make them fall in the wilderness;

27. to make their seed fall also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

28. They also were joined to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead;

29. and provoked Him with their deeds; and a plague broke out among them.

30. Then Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was stayed;

31. and it was counted to him for righteousness to generation and generation, forever.

32. And they angered Him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill for Moses because of them;

33. for they provoked his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.   

34. They did not destroy the peoples, as Jehovah said to them,

35. but mixed with the nations, and learned their works.

36. And they served their idols, and they became a snare to them.

37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;

38. and they shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. And the land was defiled with the blood.

39. And they were unclean with their works, and went whoring in their acts.

40. And the anger of Jehovah burned against His people; and He detested His inheritance.

41. And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and those who hated them ruled over them.

42. And their enemies oppressed them and they were humbled under their hand.

43. Many times He delivered them, but they rebelled in their plans, and sank in their iniquities.

44. And He looked on their affliction when He heard their shout;

45. He remembered His covenant for them, and breathed a sigh, according to His many mercies.

46. And He gave them to tender mercies before all their captors.

47. Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name, to exult in Your praise.

48. Blessed is Jehovah God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen! Praise Jehovah!  

## Psalms 107

1. Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy endures forever.

2. Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so , whom He redeemed from the hand of the foe;

3. and gathered them from the lands; from east and from west; from north and from south.

4. They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert way; they found no city of dwelling;

5. hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them;

6. and they cried to Jehovah in their distress; He delivered them from their straits.

7. And He guided them in the right way; to go to a city of dwelling.

8. Let them thank Jehovah for His mercy, and His wonders to the sons of man.

9. He satisfies the thirsty soul, and He fills the hungry soul with good.   

10. Those who live in the darkness, and in the shadow of death, being prisoners in affliction and iron,

11. because they rebelled against the words of God, and despised the counsel of the Most High;

12. and He humbled their heart by toil; they stumbled, and none were helping;

13. and they cried to Jehovah in their distress; He saved them out of their distresses;

14. He brought them out from darkness and the shadow of death; and He broke their bands apart.

15. Let them thank Jehovah for His mercy, and His wonders to the sons of man.

16. For He has broken the gates of bronze; and He cut bars of iron in two.   

17. Fools are afflicted from the way of their rebellion, and from their iniquities;

18. their soul hates every food; and they touch the gates of death;

19. and they cried to Jehovah in their distress; He saved them from their straits;

20. He sent His word and healed them; and delivered them from all their pitfalls.

21. Let them thank Jehovah for His mercy, and His wonders to the sons of man.

22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and recount His works with rejoicing.   

23. They who go down to the sea in ships, who work in the great waters;

24. these see the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep.

25. For He speaks, and He raises stormy wind, and makes its waves high;

26. they go up to the heavens; they go down to the depths; their soul is melted because they are in evil;

27. they reel and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom is swallowed up;

28. and they cry to Jehovah in their distress, and He saves them out of their straits.

29. He settles the storm to a whisper, so that its waves are still;

30. and they are glad, because they are quiet; and He led them to their desired haven.

31. Let them thank Jehovah for His mercy, and His wonders to the sons of mankind;

32. and exalt Him in the congregation of the people; and praise Him in the seat of the elders.   

33. He sets rivers to a wilderness, and watersprings to thirsty ground;

34. a fruitful land to a salty desert; because of the wickedness of those who live in it.

35. He puts the wilderness into waterponds; and dry land into water-springs;

36. and He makes the hungry live there, and they may prepare a city of dwelling.

37. And they sow the fields, and plant vineyards, and make fruits of produce.

38. He also blesses them, so that they multiply greatly; and He does not allow their cattle to diminish;

39. but they are diminished and humbled, from coercion, evil and grief.

40. He pours scorn on nobles, and causes them to wander in a desert; there is no path.

41. But He raises the poor up from affliction, and He sets families like a flock.

42. The upright shall see and be glad; and all iniquity shuts its mouth.

43. Whoever is wise and will observe these things , they shall discern the mercies of Jehovah.  

## Psalms 108

1.  A Song. A Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing; yea, I will sing songs even with my glory.

2. Awake, harp and lyre! I will awake early;

3. I will thank You, O Jehovah, among the peoples; and I will sing to You among the nations.

4. For Your mercy is great above the heavens; and Your truth reaches to the clouds.

5. Be lifted up, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth;   

6. O that Your beloved may be delivered; save by Your right hand and answer me.

7. God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice; I will portion out Shechem; and I will measure out the valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead is Mine; and Manasseh is Mine; and Ephraim is the fort of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;

9. Moab is My washpot; I will throw My shoe out over Edom; I will shout in triumph over Philistia.

10. Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will lead me over Edom?

11. O God, have You not cast us off? And, O God, will You not go out with our armies?

12. Give help to us from distress; for the deliverance of man is vain.

13. In God we shall do mighty things, for He shall trample our foes.  

## Psalms 109

1.  To the chief musician, A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, do not be silent;

2. for the mouth of the wicked, and the deceitful mouth, are opened against me; they spoke against me with a lying tongue.

3. And they hemmed me in with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

4. In return for my love, they are my enemies; but I am in prayer.

5. And they put on me evil for good; and hatred for my love.   

6. Set a wicked man over him; and let an adversary stand at his right hand;

7. when he is judged, let him go out wicked; and let his prayer become sin;

8. let his days be few; and let another take his office;

9. his sons be orphans, and his wife a widow;

10. and let his sons always beg and wander, and seek food out of their ruins;

11. let the moneylender lay a snare for all that is his; and let strangers plunder his labor;

12. let there be none giving mercy to him; nor any to have pity on his orphans;

13. let his posterity be cut off; let their name be blotted out in the following generation;

14. let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered to Jehovah; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out;

15. let them be always before Jehovah, so that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;

16. because he did not remember to do mercy; and persecuted the poor and needy man; even to kill the broken-hearted.

17. Yea, he loved cursing, and it came to him; he also had no pleasure in blessing, and it was far from him.

18. As he clothed himself with cursing, as with a robe, even it came into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

19. Let it be to him as a garment he wraps in, and for a girdle that he always girds on.

20. This is the reward of my foes from Jehovah, and of those who speak evil against my soul.   

21. But You, O Jehovah the Lord, work with me for Your name's sake; deliver me because Your mercy is good.

22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is pierced within me.

23. As a shadow when it stretches out, I am gone; I am shaken off like the locust.

24. My knees stumble from fasting, and my flesh grows lean from fatness.

25. And I have become a reproach to them; they looked at me; they shook their heads.

26. O Jehovah my God, help me; save me according to Your mercy;

27. and they will know that this is Your hand; that You, O Jehovah, have done it.

28. They will curse, but You will bless; they rise up and are ashamed; but Your servant will be glad.

29. Let those who accuse me be clothed with shame; and cover themselves in their shame as with a robe.

30. I will greatly thank Jehovah with my mouth; yea, I will praise Him in the midst of the multitude.

31. For He shall stand at the right hand of the needy; to save from those judging his soul.  

## Psalms 110

1.  A Psalm of David. A statement of Jehovah to my Lord: Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.

2. Jehovah shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion; rule in the midst of Your enemies.

3. Your people shall be willing in the day of Your power; in holy adornment from the womb of the dawn, to You is the dew of Your youth.

4. Jehovah has sworn and will not repent: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.   

5. The Lord at Your right hand shatters kings in the day of His anger.

6. He shall judge among the nations; He shall fill with dead bodies; He shall shatter heads over much land.

7. He shall drink out of the torrent on the way; therefore, He shall lift up the head.  

## Psalms 111

1. Praise Jehovah! I will thank Jehovah with all my heart; in the council of the upright, and of the assembly.

2. The works of Jehovah are great, sought out by all those desiring them.

3. His work is honorable and glorious; and His righteousness is standing forever.

4. He has made a memorial for His wonders; Jehovah is gracious and full of pity.

5. He has given food to those who fear Him; He will always remember His covenant.   

6. He has shown to His people the power of His works, to give to them inheritance of the nations.

7. The works of His hands are truth and all His commandments are true,

8. standing firm forever and ever; they are done in truth and uprightness.

9. He sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.

10. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; all who practice them have a good understanding; His praise is standing forever!  

## Psalms 112

1. Praise Jehovah! Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, delighting greatly in His commands.

2. His seed shall be mighty on the earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed;

3. wealth and riches in his house; and his righteousness is standing forever.

4. Light rises in the darkness to the upright; he is gracious and full of pity, and of righteousness.

5. Good is a man showing favor and lending; he will nourish his matters with equity.   

6. For he shall not be shaken forever; the righteous shall be for a memorial forever.

7. He shall not be afraid of evil news; his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.

8. His heart is upheld; he shall not be afraid though he looks on his foes.

9. He has scattered; he has given to the needy; his righteousness is standing forever; his horn shall be lifted up with honor.

10. The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash his teeth and melt; the desire of the wicked shall perish.  

## Psalms 113

1. Praise Jehovah! Praise, O servants of Jehovah; praise the name of Jehovah.

2. Blessed is the name of Jehovah from now on and forevermore.

3. From the rising of the sun to its going, Jehovah's name is to be praised.

4. Jehovah is high above all nations; His glory above the heavens.

5. Who is like Jehovah our God, who sits on high to dwell;

6. Who humbles Himself to consider all in the earth and the heavens!

7. He raises up the poor from the dust; He lifts the needy out of the dunghill;

8. in order to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.

9. He causes the barren to live in the house as the joyful mother of sons. Praise Jehovah!  

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel came out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

2. Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His kingdom.

3. The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back;

4. the mountains skipped like rams; the little hills like lambs!

5. What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?

6. O mountains, that you skip like rams? O little hills, like lambs?

7. Tremble, O earth, from the face of the Lord, from the face of the God of Jacob;

8. who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.  

## Psalms 115

1. Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, but to Your name give glory; for Your mercy; because of Your truth.

2. Why do the nations say, Where is their God now?

3. But our God is in Heaven; He has done all that He has pleased.

4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of man's hands;

5. they have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;

6. they have ears, but they do not hear; they have a nose, but they do not smell;

7. their hands do not feel; their feet do not walk; they do not mutter through their throat.

8. The ones who make them are like them, and everyone trusting in them.   

9. O Israel, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.

10. O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.

11. You who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.

12. Jehovah remembers us; He will bless; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;

13. He will bless those who fear Jehovah, the small and the great.

14. Jehovah will add on to you; on you and on your sons.

15. You are blessed to Jehovah, He who makes heavens and earth.

16. The heavens; the heavens are Jehovah's, but He has given the earth to the sons of men.

17. The dead do not praise Jehovah, nor all those who go down into silence;

18. but we will bless Jehovah, from now on and forever. Praise Jehovah!  

## Psalms 116

1. I love Jehovah because He hears my voice, my prayers.

2. Because He has bowed His ear to me, I will also call in my days.

3. The cords of death hemmed me in; and the pains of Sheol found me; I find distress and sorrow;

4. then I call on the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech You, deliver my soul!

5. Jehovah is gracious and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

6. Jehovah keeps the simple; I was low, but He saved me.

7. Return to your rest, O soul; for Jehovah has blessed you.

13. I will lift up the cup of salvation, and I will call on the name of Jehovah.

7. Jehovah is for me among those who help me, and I shall see my desire on those who hate me.

8.  It is better to trust in Jehovah than to trust in man;

9.  it is better to trust in Jehovah than to trust in princes.

10. All the nations surround me; but surely I will destroy them in the name of Jehovah.

11. They surround me; yea, they surround me; I surely will destroy them in the name of Jehovah.

12. they surround me like bees; they are quenched like the fire of thorns; for surely I will cut them off in the name of Jehovah.

13. Pushing, you pushed me to fall; but Jehovah helped me.

14. Jehovah is my strength and my song; and He is my salvation.

15. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of Jehovah works mightily.

16. The right hand of Jehovah is exalted; the right hand of Jehovah acts mightily.

17. I shall not die, but I shall live and declare the works of Jehovah.

18. Jehovah has grievously chastened me, but He has not given me to death.   

19. Open the gates of righteousness to me, I will enter into them; I will thank Jehovah.

20. This is the gate of Jehovah, the righteous shall enter into it.

21. I will thank You, for You answered me, and are my salvation.

84. As what are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment on my persecutors?   

85. The proud have dug pits for me which are not according to Your law.

86. All Your commands are faithful; they persecute me with lying; help me!

124. Deal with Your servant by Your mercy; and teach me Your statutes.

125. I am Your servant; make me consider and I will know Your testimonies.   

126.  It is time for Jehovah to work; they have broken Your law.

140. Your word is pure and Your servant loves it.   

141. I am small and despised; I do not forget Your precepts.

157. My persecutors and enemies are many; I do not turn from Your testimonies.   

158. I saw the traitors and was grieved, because they did not keep Your word.

172. My tongue shall answer Your word, for all Your commands are righteousness.   

173. Let Your hand help me; for I have chosen Your precepts

174. I have longed for Your salvation, O Jehovah; and Your law is my delight.   

175. Let my soul live and it will praise You; and let Your judgments help me.   

176. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant; for I do not forget Your commandments.  

## Psalms 120

4. Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of broom!   

5. Woe is me that I sojourned in Meshech; I dwell with the tents of Kedar!

7. I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

4. Our soul is exceedingly filled for itself with the contempt of those who are at ease, the scorn of the proud.  

## Psalms 124

1.  A Song of Ascents, of David. Except that it was Jehovah who was for us, O may Israel say;

2. except that it was Jehovah who was for us when men rose up against us,

3. then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger glowed against us.

4. Then the waters would have flowed over us; the torrent would have covered our soul;

5. then the raging waters would have passed over our soul.   

6. Blessed be Jehovah, who did not give us as a prey to their teeth.

## Psalms 126

1.  A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah turned back the captivity of Zion, we were like those who dream.

3. Behold! Children are an inheritance of Jehovah; the fruit of the womb is His reward.

## Psalms 129

1.  A Song of Ascents. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now say;

2. they have afflicted me from my youth many times, yet they have not prevailed over me.

3. The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long.

4. Jehovah is righteous; He severs the cords of the wicked.   

5. Let them be ashamed and turned back, all those who hate Zion;

6. let them be like the grass on the rooftops, which dries up before it draws out;

7. with which the reaper does not fill his palm, nor the binder of sheaves his bosom.

8. And those who pass by have never said, The blessing of Jehovah be on you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah.  

## Psalms 130

3. Let Israel hope in Jehovah, from now and till forever.  

## Psalms 132

1.  A Song of Ascents. O Jehovah, remember David with all his afflictions;

2. how he swore to Jehovah; he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,

3. If I will go into the tent of my house, if I go up on the couch of my bed,

4. if I give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids,

5. until I search out a place for Jehovah, dwellings for the Mighty One of Jacob.

6. Lo, we have heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the fields of the forest;

7. we will enter into His tabernacles; we will worship at His footstool.

8. Arise, O Jehovah, into Your rest; You, and the ark of Your strength;

9. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints shout for joy.

10. For Your servant David's sake do not turn away the face of Your anointed.   

11. Jehovah has sworn to David in truth; He will not turn from it; I will set one of the fruit of your body on the throne for you.

12. If your sons will keep My covenant and My testimonies which I will teach them, their sons shall also sit on your throne till forever.

13. Jehovah has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling-place.

14. This is My rest till forever; I will dwell here; I have desired it.

15. I will surely bless her food; I will satisfy her poor with food.

16. And I will clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall surely shout.

## Psalms 133

1.  A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold! How good and how pleasant is the living of brothers, even in unity.

2.  It is like the precious oil on the head that ran down on the beard, Aaron's beard, going down to the mouth of his garments;

3. like the dew of Hermon coming down on the mountains of Zion; for there Jehovah commanded the blessing: life till everlasting.  

## Psalms 134

5. For I know that Jehovah is great, and our Lord is above all gods.

6. Every thing which Jehovah was pleased to do, He did, in the heavens and in the earth; and in the seas and all deep places.

7. He causes the vapors to rise from the end of the earth; He makes lightnings for the rain; He brings the wind out of His storehouses;

8.  He who struck the first-born of Egypt, from man to animal;

9.  who sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, on Pharaoh and on all his servants;

10. who struck great nations, and killed mighty kings;

11. Sihon king Of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.

12. And He gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to His people Israel.

13. O Jehovah, Your name endures forever; O Jehovah, Your memorial is from generation and generation.

14. For Jehovah will judge His people; and He will have pity on His servants.   

15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands;

16. they have mouths, but they say nothing; they have eyes, but they see nothing;

17. they have ears, but they hear nothing; yea, there is no breath in their mouths.

18. Those who make them are like them, everyone who is trusting in them.

19. Bless Jehovah, O house of Israel; bless Jehovah, O house of Aaron;

20. Bless Jehovah, O house of Levi; you who fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah.

21. Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, He who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise Jehovah!

## Psalms 137

1. There by the rivers of Babylon we sat down; also we wept when we remembered Zion.

2. We hung our lyres on the willows in its midst.

3. For there our captors asked us the words of a song; yea, our plunderers asked joy, saying , Sing to us a song of Zion.

4. How shall we sing the song of Jehovah on a foreign soil?

5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget;

6. let my tongue cleave to my palate, if I do not remember you, if I do not bring up Jerusalem above the head of my joy.   

7. O Jehovah, remember for the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Make it bare! Make it bare even to its foundation!

8. O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one! Blessed is he who shall repay to you your reward which you rewarded to us.

9. Blessed is he who seizes your little ones and dashes them against the stone!

## Psalms 139

1.  To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, You have searched me and known me .

2. You know my sitting down, and my rising up; You understand my thought from afar off.

3. You sift my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.

4. For not a word is on my tongue, but, lo, O Jehovah, You know it all.

5. You have closed me in behind, and in front, and Your hand is laid on me.

6.  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is set on high; I am not able to reach it.   

7. Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from Your face?

8. If I go up to Heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there !

9.  If I take the wings of the morning, dwelling in the uttermost part of the sea,

10. even there Your hand shall lead me; and Your right hand shall seize me.

11. If I say: Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light around me.

12. Even the darkness will not be dark from You, but the night shines as the day; as is the darkness, so is the light.

13. For You have possessed my inward parts; You wove me in the womb of my mother.

14. I will thank You, for with fearful things I am wonderful; Your works are marvelous, and my soul knows it very well.

15. My bones were not hidden from You when I was made in secret; when I was woven in the depths of the earth.

16. Your eyes saw my embryo; and in Your book all my members were written the days they were formed, and not one was among them.   

17. And how precious are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!

18.  If I should count them, they are more than the sand; when I awake I am still with You.

19. Surely You will slay the wicked, O God; and bloody men, depart from me.

20. Who will maliciously speak against You? Your enemies are lifted up with vanity.

21. O Jehovah, do not I hate those hating You? And am I not detesting those rising against You?

22. I hate them with a perfect hatred; they have become my enemies.

23. Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;

24. and see if any wicked way is in me; and lead me in the way everlasting.  

## Psalms 140

4. O Jehovah, keep me from the wicked's hands; keep me from the violent man who plans to trip up my steps.

6. I said to Jehovah, You are my God; O Jehovah, hear the voice of my prayers.

7. O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of armor.   

8. O Jehovah, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not promote his plan, lest they be exalted. Selah.

9.  As for the leaders of those around me, let the evil of their own lips cover them.

10. Let burning coals fall on them; let them fall on coals of fire; make them fall into deep pits so that they do not rise again.

11. Do not let a man of tongue be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man, thrust upon thrust.

12. I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, the justice of the poor.

13. Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence.  

## Psalms 141

1.  A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, I cry to You; hasten to me; hear my voice when I cry to You.

2. Let my prayer be established before You as incense; the lifting up of my palms as the evening sacrifice.

3. O Jehovah, set a guard to my mouth; keep watch on the door of my lips.

4. Do not let my heart turn aside to any evil thing, to practice deeds in wickedness with men who do evil; and do not let me eat of their delicacies.   

5. Let the righteous strike me; it is a mercy; and he rebuking me, it is oil of the head, let not my head refuse it ; for yet my prayer also shall be against their evils.

6. Their judges have been dashed against the rock; they shall hear my words for they are pleasant.

7. As when one plows and tears the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

8. But my eyes are on You, O Jehovah, my Lord; in You I take refuge; do not make my soul naked.

9. Keep me from the hands of the trap they laid for me, and from the snares of the workers of evil.

10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets at the same time; I even shall pass by.  

## Psalms 142

1.  An Instruction of David, a Prayer, in his being in the cave. I cry to Jehovah with my voice; I pray to Jehovah with my voice.

2. I pour out my musing before Him; I declare my distress before Him.

3. When my spirit faints within me, then You know my path; they have hidden a snare for me in the path in which I walk.   

4. I look to the right hand and see, and no one recognizes me; every escape is hidden from me; no one inquires for my soul.

5. I cried to You, O Jehovah; I said, You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.

6. Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from those who pursue me; for they are stronger than I.

7. Bring my soul out from prison to give thanks to Your name; the righteous shall gather around me; for You shall deal bountifully with me.  

## Psalms 143

1.  A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah give ear to my supplications; answer me in Your faithfulness, in Your righteousness;

2. and do not enter into judgment with Your servant; for not anyone living is just in Your sight.

3. For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has beaten my life to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of old.

4. And my spirit within me has fainted; my heart within me is stunned.

5. I remember the days of old. I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands.

6. I spread out my hands to You; my soul thirsts to You like a thirsty land. Selah.   

7. O Jehovah, answer me quickly; my spirit is failing; do not hide Your face from me lest I be like the ones who go down to the Pit.

8. Cause me to hear Your mercy in the morning, for I do trust in You; cause me to know the way I should walk, for I lift up my soul to You.

9. O Jehovah, deliver me from my enemies; to You I have hidden.

10. Teach me to do Your will; for You are my God; Your Spirit is good; lead me into the land of justice.

11. O Jehovah, because of Your name, enliven me; in Your righteousness, bring my soul out of distress.

12. And in Your mercy cut off my enemies; and destroy all those who afflict my soul; for I am Your servant.

3. O Jehovah, what is man that You know him; the son of man, that you esteem him?

4. Man is like to vanity; his days are like a shadow that passes.

5. Bow down Your heavens, O Jehovah; and come down; touch the mountains and they shall smoke.

6. Flash out lightning and scatter them; send out Your arrows and confound them.

7. Send Your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of a foreigner's sons,

8. whose mouths have spoken vanity; and their right hand is a right hand of lies.   

9. I will sing a new song to You, O God; I will sing praises to You on a harp of ten strings ,

10. You who gives salvation to kings, who delivers His servant David from the evil sword.

11. Rescue me and deliver me from the foreigners' sons, those whose mouths have spoken vanity; and their right hand is a right hand of lies;

12. so that our sons may be like plants grown up in their youth; and our daughters like corner-stones hewn like a palace building;

13.  and our storehouses may be full, furnishing kind to kind; our flocks may breed thousands and ten thousands outside,

14. our oxen laden; there is no break and no going out, and no crying in our plazas.

15. Blessed are the peoples that are so; blessed are the peoples whose God is Jehovah!

2. While I live I will praise Jehovah; I will sing praises to my God while I have being.

3. Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, for there is no salvation in him.

4. His breath will go out, he returns to the earth; his thoughts perish in that day.   

5. Blessed is he who has the God of Jacob in his help; his hope is on Jehovah his God;

6. who made the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;

7. who executes judgment for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry; Jehovah sets free the prisoners;

8. Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raises those bowed down; Jehovah loves the righteous;

9. Jehovah watches over the strangers; He relieves the orphan and the widow, but He warps the way of the wicked.

10. Jehovah shall reign forever; O Zion, your God from generation and generation. Praise Jehovah.  

## Psalms 147

1. Praise Jehovah; for it is good to sing praise to our God; because praise is delightful and becoming.

2. Jehovah builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.

3.  He heals the broken-hearted and binds up their sorrows.

4. He appoints the number of the stars; He calls to them all by names.

5. Our Lord is great and of great might; there is no limit to His understanding.

6. Jehovah relieves the meek; He throws the wicked down to the ground.

7. Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving; sing praise on the lyre to our God,

8. who covers the heavens with clouds; who prepares rain for the earth; who makes grass to grow on the mountains.

9.  He gives the animals their food, to the young ravens that cry.

10. He takes no delight in the strength of the horse, nor any pleasure in the legs of a man.

11. Jehovah takes pleasure in those who fear Him, those who hope in His mercy.   

12. Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.

13. For He has made strong the bars of your gates; He has blessed your sons within you.

14. He makes peace in your border, He satisfies you with the fat of the wheat.

15. He sends His command out on the earth; His word runs very swiftly;

16. He gives snow like wool; He scatters the white frost like ashes;

17. He casts out His ice like crumbs; who can stand before His cold?

18. He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.

19. He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.

20. He has not done so with any nation; and they have not known His judgments. Praise Jehovah!

4. Praise Him, O heavens of heavens; and O waters that are above the heavens.

5. Let them praise the name of Jehovah; for He commanded, and they were created.

6. And He established them forever and ever; He gave a decree that they not pass away.   

7. Let the sea-monsters and all deeps praise Jehovah from the earth,

8. fire and hail, snow and smoke, stormy wind fulfilling His word,

9. mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,

10. beasts and all livestock, creeping things and birds of the wing,

11. kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the earth,

12. young men and virgins too, old men and youths.

13. Let them praise the name of Jehovah; for His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and heavens.

14. He also lifts up the horn of His people, the praise of all His saints, of the sons of Israel, a people near to Him, Praise Jehovah.

2. Let Israel rejoice in His Makers; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their Kings.

3. Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praise to Him with the timbrel and lyre.

4. For Jehovah takes pleasure in His people; He beautifies the meek with salvation.

5. Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud on their beds.   

6.  Let the exaltation of God be in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand,

7. to execute vengeance on the nations, punishment on the peoples;

8. to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with iron bands;

9. to execute on them the judgment written; this is an honor for all His saints. Praise Jehovah!
