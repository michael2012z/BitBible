# Romans

## Romans 1

1. Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God,

2. which He promised before through His prophets in holy Scriptures,

3. concerning His Son who came of the seed of David according to flesh,

4. who was marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

5. by whom we received grace and apostleship to obedience of faith among all the nations, for His name's sake,

6. among whom are you also, called-out ones of Jesus Christ;

7. to all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called-out saints, Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.   

8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of in all the world.

9. For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how without ceasing I make mention of you

10. always at my prayers, beseeching if by any means now at length I shall be blessed by the will of God to come to you.

11. For I long to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, for the establishing of you;

12. and this is to be comforted together among you, through the faith in one another, both yours and mine.

13. But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I purposed to come to you, and was kept back until the present, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other nations.

14. I am a debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise, and to foolish,

15. so as far as in me lies , I am eager to preach the gospel to you in Rome also.   

16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone believing, both to Jew first, and to Greek;

17. for in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; even as it has been written, "But the just shall live by" "faith." Hab. 2:4

18. For God's wrath is revealed from Heaven on all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, holding the truth in unrighteousness,   

19. because the thing known of God is clearly known within them, for God revealed it to them.

20. for the unseen things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things made, both His eternal power and Godhead, for them to be without excuse.

21. Because knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful. But they became vain in their reasonings, and their undiscerning heart was darkened.

22. Professing to be wise, they became foolish

23. and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into a likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.

24. Because of this, God gave them up to impurity in the lusts of their hearts, their bodies to be dishonored among themselves,

25. who changed the truth of God into the lie, and worshiped and served the created thing more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

26. Because of this, God gave them up to dishonorable passions, for even their females changed the natural use to that contrary to nature.

27. And likewise, the males also forsaking the natural use of the female burned in their lust toward one another, males with males working out shamefulness, and receiving back within themselves the reward which was fitting for their error.

28. And even as they did not think fit to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do the things not right,

29. having been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, iniquity, covetousness, malice, being full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, evil habits, becoming whisperers,

30. slanderers, God-haters, insolent, proud, braggarts, devisers of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31. without discernment, perfidious, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful,

32. who knowing the righteous order of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also applaud those practicing them .  

## Romans 2

1. Therefore, O man, you are without excuse, everyone who judges, for in that in which you judge the other, you condemn yourself; for you, those judging, practice the same things.

2. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth on those that practice such things.

3. And, O man, the one judging those practicing such things, and doing them, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?

4. Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, and the forbearance and the longsuffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?

5. But according to your hardness and your impenitent heart, do you treasure up to yourself wrath in a day of wrath, and revelation of a righteous judgment of God?

6.  He "will give to each according to his works:" LXX-Psa. 61:13; MT-Psa. 62:12

7. everlasting life truly to those who with patience in good work are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibility;

8. but to those even disobeying the truth, out of self interest, and obeying unrighteousness, will be anger and wrath,

9. trouble and pain on every soul of man that works out evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek.

10. But glory and honor and peace will be to everyone that works out good, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek.

11. For there is no respect of persons with God.

12. For as many as sinned without Law will also perish without Law. And as many as sinned within Law will be judged through Law.

13. For not the hearers of the Law are just with God, but the doers of the Law shall be justified.

14. For when nations not having Law do by nature the things of the Law, they not having Law are a law to themselves,

15. who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience witnessing with them , and the thoughts between one another accusing or even excusing,

16. in a day when God judges the hidden things of men, according to my gospel, through Jesus Christ.   

17. Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the Law, and boast in God,

18. and know the will, and approve the things excelling, being instructed out of the Law,

19. and persuading yourself to be a guide of blind ones, a light to those in darkness,

20. an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law.

21. Then the one teaching another, do you not teach yourself? The one preaching not to steal, do you steal?

22. The one saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one detesting the idols, do you rob temples?

23.  You who boast in Law, do you dishonor God through transgression of the Law?

24. For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations through you, even as it has been written: Isa. 52:5

25. For indeed circumcision profits if you practice the Law, but if you are a transgressor of Law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.

26. If, then, the uncircumcision keeps the demands of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

27. And will not the uncircumcision by nature by keeping the Law judge you, the one who through letter and circumcision becomes transgressor of Law?

28. For he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that outwardly in flesh;

29. but he is a Jew that is one inwardly, and circumcision is of heart, in spirit, not in letter; of whom the praise is not from men, but from God.  

## Romans 3

1. What then is the superiority of the Jew? Or what the profit of circumcision?

2. Much every way. For first, indeed, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.

3. For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief destroy the faith of God?

4. Let it not be! But let God be true, and every man a liar; even as it has been written, "That You should be justified in Your words, and will overcome in Your being judged." LXX-Psa. 50:6; MT-Psa. 51:4

5. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who lays on wrath? I speak according to man.

6. Let it not be! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?

7. For if in my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I yet judged as a sinner?

8. And not (as we are wrongly accused, and as some report us to say), Let us do bad things so that good things may come, the judgment of whom is just.

9. What then? Do we excel? Not at all! For we have charged both Jews and Greeks before, all with being under sin;

10. according as it has been written, "There is none righteous, not one!"

11. There is none that understands, there is "not one that seeks after God.

12. All turned away, they became worthless together, not one is doing goodness, not so much as one!" LXX-Psa. 13:1 -3

13. "Their throat is an opened grave;" "they used deceit with their tongues; the poison of asps is under their lips;

14. whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.

15. Their feet are swift to shed blood;

16. ruin and misery are in their way;

17. and they did not know a way of peace;

18. there is no fear of God before their eyes." LXX-Psa. 5:10; 139:4; 9:28; Isa. 59:7, 8; Psa. 35:2; MT-Psa. 14:1 -3; 5:9; 140:3; 10:7; Isa. 59:7, 8; Psa. 36:1   

19. But we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those within the Law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God.

20. Because by works of law not one of all flesh will be justified before Him, for through law is full knowledge of sin. Psa. 143:2

21. But now a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,

22. even the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ toward all and upon all those believing; for there is no difference,

23. for all sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

24. being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus,

25. whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, for a showing forth of His righteousness through the passing by of the sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God,

26. for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, for His being just and justifying the one that is of the faith of Jesus.

27. Then where is the boasting? It was excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through a law of faith.

28. Then we conclude a man to be justified by faith without works of law.

29. Or is He the God of Jews only, and not also of the nations? Yes, of the nations also,

30. since it is one God who will justify circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

31. Then do we make law of no effect through faith? Let it not be! But we establish law.  

## Romans 4

1. What then shall we say our father Abraham to have found according to flesh?

2. For if Abraham was justified by works, he has a boast, but not with God.

3. For what does the Scripture say? "And Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness." Gen. 15:6

4. Now to one working, the reward is not counted according to grace, but according to debt.

5. But to the one not working, but believing on Him justifying the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

6. Even as also David says of the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:

7. "Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;

8. blessed the man to whom the Lord will in no way charge sin." LXX-Psa. 31:1, 2; MT-Psa. 32:1, 2   

9.  Is this blessedness then on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say the faith "was counted to Abraham for righteousness." Gen. 15:6

10. How then was it counted? Being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision!

11. And he received a sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith while in uncircumcision, for him to be a father of those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be counted to them also,

12. and a father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but also to those walking in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.

13. For the promise was not through law to Abraham, or to his seed, for him to be the heir of the world, but through a righteousness of faith.

14. For if those of Law are heirs, faith has been made of no effect, and the promise has been destroyed.

15. For the law works out wrath; for where no law is, neither is transgression.

16. On account of this, it is of faith, that it be according to grace, for the promise to be made sure to all the seed, not to that of the Law only, but also to that of the faith of Abraham, who is father of us all,   

17. according as it has been written, "I have appointed you a father of many nations;" before God, whom he believed, the One making the dead live, and calling the things that are not as if they were. Gen. 17:5

18.  He against hope believed in hope, for him to become a father of many nations, according to what has been said, "So shall your seed be." Gen. 15:5

19. And being about a hundred years old , not weakening in faith, he did not consider his body to have died already, nor yet the death of Sarah's womb,

20. and did not stagger by unbelief at the promise of God, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God,

21. and being fully persuaded that what He has promised, He is also able to do.

22. Because of this, "it was also counted to him for righteousness." Gen. 15:6   

23. But it was not written for him only, that it was counted to him,

24. but also on account of us, to whom it is about to be counted, to the ones believing on Him who has raised our Lord Jesus from the dead,

25. who was delivered because our offenses and was raised because of our justification.  

## Romans 5

1. Then being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

2. through whom also we have had access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we glory on the hope of the glory of God.

3. And not only so, but we glory also in afflictions, knowing that affliction works out patience,

4. and patience works out proven character; and proven character, hope.

5. And the hope does not put us to shame, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit given to us;   

6. for we yet being without strength, in due time Christ died for ungodly ones.

7. For with difficulty one will die for a just one, (for perhaps one even dares to die for the sake of the good one),

8. but God commends His love to us in this , that we being yet sinners, Christ died for us.

9. Much more then, being justified now by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.

10. For if while being enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life;

11. and not only so , but also glorying in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we now received the reconciliation.

12. Because of this, even as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death passed to all men, inasmuch as all sinned.

13. For sin was in the world until Law, but sin is not charged where there is no law;

14. but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even on those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of the coming One .

15. But the free gift shall not be also like the offense. For if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace, which is of the one Man, Jesus Christ, did abound to the many.

16. And the gift shall not be as by one having sinned; for indeed the judgment was of one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.

17. For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who are receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall rule in life by the One, Jesus Christ.

18. So then, as through one offense it was toward all men to condemnation, so also by one accomplished righteousness toward all men to justification of life.

19. For as through the one man's disobedience the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many shall be constituted righteous.

20. But Law came in beside, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace much more abounded,

21. that as sin ruled in death, so also grace might rule through righteousness to everlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.  

## Romans 6

1. What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

2. Let it not be! We who died to sin, how shall we still live in it?

3. Or are you ignorant that all who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?

4. Therefore, we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.

5. For if we have been joined together in the likeness of His death, so also shall we be in the resurrection,

6. knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him , that the body of sin might be nullified, so that we no longer serve sin.

7. For the one that died has been justified from sin.

8. But if we died with Christ, we believe that also we shall live with Him,

9. knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death no longer lords it over Him.

10. For in that He died, He died to sin once for all; but in that He lives, He lives to God.

11. So also you count yourselves to be truly dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

12. Then do not let sin rule in your mortal body, to obey it in its lusts.

13. Neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as one living from the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God.

14. For your sin shall not lord it over you, for you are not under law, but under grace.

15. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Let it not be!

16. Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves to whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or obedience to righteousness?

17. But thanks be to God that you were slaves of sin, but you obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine to which you were delivered.

18. And having been set free from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness.

19. I speak as a man on account of the weakness of your flesh. For as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and to lawless act unto lawless act, so now yield your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.

20. For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as to righteousness.

21. Therefore what fruit did you have then in the things over which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

22. But now being set free from sin, and being enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end everlasting life.

23. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is everlasting life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

## Romans 7

1. Or are you ignorant, brothers, (for I speak to those knowing law), that the law lords it over the man for as long a time as he lives?

2. For the married woman was bound by law to the living husband; but if the husband dies, she is set free from the law of the husband.

3. So then, if the husband is living, she will be called an adulteress if she becomes another man's. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so as for her not to be an adulteress by becoming another man's.

4. So that, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, for you to become Another's, to One raised from the dead, so that we may bear fruit to God.

5. For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin were working in our members through the law for the bearing of fruit unto death.

6. But now we have been set free from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so as for us to serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.   

7. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Let it not be! But I did not know sin except through law; for also I did not know lust except the law said, "You shall not lust." Ex. 20:17

8. But sin taking occasion through the commandment worked every lust in me; for apart from law, sin is dead.

9. And I was alive apart from law once, but the commandment came, and sin came alive, and I died.

10. And the commandment which was to life, this was found to be death to me;

11. for sin taking occasion through the commandment deceived me, and through it killed me .

12. So indeed the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.

13. Then that which is good, has it become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear to be sin, having worked out death to me through the good, in order that sin might become excessively sinful through the commandment.   

14. For we know that the law is spiritual, and I am fleshly, having been sold under sin.

15. For what I work out, I do not know. For what I do not will, this I do. But what I hate, this I do.

16. But if I do what I do not will, I agree with the law, that it is good.

17. But now I no longer work it out, but the sin dwelling in me.

18. For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good. For to will is present to me, but to work out the good I do not find.

19. For what good I desire, I do not do. But the evil I do not desire, this I do.

20. But if I do what I do not desire, it is no longer I working it out, but sin dwelling in me.

21. I find then the law, when I desire to do the right, that evil is present with me.

22. For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;

23. but I see another law in my members having warred against the law of my mind, and taking me captive by the law of sin being in my members.

24. O wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

25. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then I myself with the mind truly serve the law of God, and with the flesh the law of sin.  

## Romans 8

1.  There is therefore now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to Spirit.

2. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus set me free from the law of sin and of death.

3. For the law being powerless, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,

4. So that the righteous demand of the law might be fulfilled in us, those not walking according to flesh, but according to Spirit.

5. For the ones that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh. And the ones according to Spirit mind the things of the Spirit.

6. For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;

7. because the mind of the flesh is enmity towards God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be .

8. And those being in the flesh are not able to please God.

9. But you are not in flesh, but in Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, this one is not His.   

10. But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

11. But if the Spirit of the One having raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the One having raised the Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies live through the indwelling of His Spirit in you.

12. So, then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh,

13. for if you live according to flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.

14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.

15. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery again to fear, but you received a Spirit of adoption by which we cry, Abba! Father!

16. The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.   

17. And if children, also heirs; truly heirs of God, and joint-heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer together, that we may also be glorified together.

18. For I calculate that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to compare to the coming glory to be revealed in us.

19. For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God.

20. For the creation was not willingly subjected to vanity, but through Him subjecting it , on hope;

21. that also the creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption to the freedom of the glory of the children of God.

22. For we know that all the creation groans together and travails together until now.

23. And not only so , but also we ourselves having the firstfruit of the Spirit, also we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly expecting adoption, the redemption of our body;

24. for we were saved by hope, but hope being seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope?

25. But if we hope for what we do not see, through patience we wait eagerly.   

26. And likewise the Spirit also joins in to help our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray as we ought, but the Spirit Himself pleads our case for us with groanings that cannot be uttered.

27. But the One searching the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.

28. But we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose;   

29. because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, for Him to be the First-born among many brothers.

30. But whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; but whom He justified, these He also glorified.   

31. What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?

32. Truly He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not freely give us all things with Him?

33. Who will bring any charge against God's elect? God is the One justifying!

34. Who is he condemning? It is Christ who has died, but rather also is raised, who also is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.

35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

36. Even as it has been written, "For Your sake we are killed all the day; we are counted as sheep of slaughter." Psa. 44:22

37. But in all these things we more than conquer through Him loving us.

38. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

39. nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, our Lord.  

## Romans 9

1. I tell the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,

2. that my grief is great, and a never ceasing pain is in my heart,

3. for I myself was wishing to be a curse from Christ on behalf of my brothers, my kinsmen according to flesh,

4. who are Israelites, whose are the adoption and the glory, and the covenants, and the Lawgiving, and the service, and the promises;

5. whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to flesh, He being God over all, blessed forever. Amen.   

6. Not, however, that God's word has failed. For not all those of Israel are Israel,

7. nor because they are Abraham's seed are all children, but "In Isaac a Seed shall be called to you." Gen. 21:12

8. That is: Not the children of flesh are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted for a seed.

9. For the word of promise is this, According to this time I will come, and a son will be to Sarah. Gen. 18:10

10. And not only so, but also Rebekah conceiving of one, our father Isaac,

11. for the children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of the One calling,

12. it was said to her, "The greater shall serve the lesser;" Gen. 25:23

13. even as it has been written, "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau." Mal. 1:2, 3   

14. What then shall we say? Is there not unrighteousness with God? Let it not be!

15. For He said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will pity whomever I will pity." Ex. 33:19

16. So, then, it is not of the one willing, nor of the one running, but of the One showing mercy, of God.

17. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very thing I raised you up, so that I might show forth My power in you, and so that My name might be publicized in all the earth." Ex. 9:16

18. So, then, to whom He desires, He shows mercy. And to whom He desires, He hardens.

19. You will then say to me, Why does He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?

20. Yes, rather, O man, who are you answering against God? Shall the thing formed say to the One forming it , Why did You make me like this? Isa. 29:16

21. Or does not the potter have authority over the clay, out of the one lump to make one vessel to honor, and one to dishonor? Jer. 18:6

22. But if God, desiring to show forth wrath, and to make His power known, endured in much long-suffering vessels of wrath having been fitted out for destruction,

23. and that He make known the riches of His glory on vessels of mercy which He before prepared for glory,

24. whom He also called, not only us, of Jews, but also out of nations.   

25. As also He says in Hosea, I will call those not My people, My people! And those not beloved, Beloved! Hosea 2:23

26. "And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there they will be called, Sons of the living God." LXX-Hos. 2:1; MT-Hos. 2:23

27. But Isaiah cries on behalf of Israel, "If the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant will be saved."

28. For He is bringing the matter to an end, and having been cut short "in righteousness," "because the Lord" "will do a thing cut short" "on the earth." Isa. 10:22, 23

29. And as Isaiah has said before, "Except the Lord of hosts left a seed to us, we would have become as Sodom, and we would have become as Gomorrah." Isa. 1:9   

30. What then shall we say? That the nations not following after righteousness have taken on righteousness, but a righteousness of faith;

31. but Israel following after a law of righteousness did not arrive at a law of righteousness?

32. Why? Because it was not of faith, but as of works of Law. For they stumbled at the Stone-of-stumbling,

33. as it has been written, "Behold, I place in" "Zion a Stone-of-stumbling," "and a Rock-of-offense," "and everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame." LXX and MT-Isa. 28:16; MT-Isa. 8:14  

## Romans 10

1. Brothers, truly my heart's pleasure and supplication to God on behalf of Israel is for it to be saved.

2. For I testify to them that they have zeal to God, but not according to knowledge.

3. For being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to the righteousness of God.

4. For Christ is the end of law for righteousness to everyone that believes.

5. For Moses writes of the righteousness which is of the law: "The man doing these things shall live by them." Lev. 18:5

6. But the righteousness of faith says this: "Do not say in your heart, Who will go up into Heaven?" (that is, to bring down Christ);

7. or, "Who will go down into the abyss?" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)

8. But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith which we proclaim) Deut. 9:4; 30:12-14 .

9. Because if you confess the Lord Jesus with your mouth, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

10. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses unto salvation.

11. For the Scripture says, "Everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame." Isa. 28:16   

12. For there is no difference both of Jew and of Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich toward all the ones calling on Him.

13. For everyone, "whoever may call on the name of the Lord will be saved." Joel 3:5

14. How then may they call on One in whom they have not believed? And how may they believe One of whom they have not heard? And how may they hear without preaching?

15. And how may they preach if they are not sent? Even as it has been written, "How beautiful" "the feet of those announcing the gospel of peace, of those announcing the gospel of good things." Isa. 52:7

16. But not all obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" Isa. 53:1

17. Then faith is of hearing, and hearing through the Word of God.

18. But I say, Did they not hear? Yes, rather, "into all the earth their voice went out, and to the ends of the world their words." LXX-Psa. 18:5; MT-Psa. 19:4

19. But I say, Did not Israel know? First, Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy by a not-nation, by an unwise nation I will anger you." Deut. 32:21

20. But Isaiah is very bold and says, "I was found by those not seeking Me; I became known to those not inquiring after Me." Isa. 65:1

21. But to Israel He says, "All the day I stretched out My hands to a disobeying and contradicting people." Isa. 65:2  

## Romans 11

1. I say then, Did not God thrust away His people? Let it not be! For I also am an Israelite, out of Abraham's seed, of the tribe of Benjamin.

2. "God did not thrust away His people" whom He foreknew. Psa. 94:14 Or do you not know what the Scripture said in Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,

3. Lord, "they killed Your prophets," "and they dug down Your altars," "and only I am left, and they seek my life." 1 Kg. 19:10

4. But what does the Divine answer say to him, "I reserved to Myself seven thousand men who did not bow a knee to Baal." 1 Kg. 19:18

5. So then, also in the present time a remnant according to election of grace has come into being. Isa. 29:10, Deut. 29:4

6. But if by grace, no longer is it of works; else grace no longer becomes grace. But if of works, it is no longer grace; else work is no longer work.

7. What then? What Israel seeks, this it did not obtain, but the election obtained it , and the rest were hardened;

8. even as it has been written, "God gave to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not seeing and ears not hearing" until this day. Isa. 29:10; Deut. 29:4

9. And David said, "Let their table become for a snare and a trap, and for a stumbling block," and a repayment to them;

10. "let their eyes be darkened, not to see, and their back always bowing." LXX-68:23, 24; MT-Psa. 69:22, 23

11. I say, then, Did not they stumble that they fall? Let it not be! But by their slipping away came salvation to the nations, to provoke them to jealousy.

12. But if their slipping away is the riches of the world, and their default the riches of the nations, how much more their fullness?

13. For I speak to you, the nations, since I am an apostle of the nations, (I glorify my ministry),

14. if somehow I may provoke to jealousy my flesh, and may save some of them.

15. For if their casting away is the reconciliation of the world, what the reception, except life from the dead?

16. Now if the firstfruit is holy, also the lump. And if the root is holy, also the branches.

17. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree were grafted in among them, and became a sharer of the root and the fatness of the olive tree,

18. do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, it is not you that bears the root, but the root bears you.

19. You will say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.

20. Well! For unbelief they were broken off. And you stand by faith. Do not be highminded, but fear.

21. For if God did not spare the natural branches, fear that it may be He will not spare you either.

22. Behold, then, the kindness and severity of God: On those having fallen, severity. But on you, kindness, if you continue in the kindness. Otherwise, you will also be cut off.

23. And those also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.

24. For if you were cut out of the natural wild olive tree , and against nature were grafted into a good olive tree , how much more these being according to nature will be grafted into their own olive tree?

25. For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be wise within yourselves, that hardness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the nations comes in;

26. and so all Israel will be saved, even as it has been written, "The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.

27. And this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins." Isa. 59:20, 21

28. Indeed, as regards the gospel, enemies for you, but as regards the election, beloved for the sake of the fathers.

29. For the free gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.

30. For as you then also disobeyed God, but now have obtained mercy by the disobedience of these,

31. so also these now have disobeyed, so that they also may obtain mercy by your mercy.

32. For God shut up all in disobedience, that He may show mercy to all.   

33. O the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!

34. "For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who became His counselor?" Isa. 40:13

35. "Or who first gave to Him, and it will be repaid to him?" Job 41:11

36. Because of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.  

## Romans 12

1. Therefore, brothers, I call on you through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.

2. And be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, in order to prove by you what is the good and pleasing and perfect will of God.

3. For through the grace which is given to me, I say to everyone being among you, not to have high thoughts beyond what is right to think. But set your mind to be right-minded, even as God divided a measure of faith to each.

4. For even as we have many members in one body, but all members do not have the same function,

5. so we the many are one body in Christ, and each one members of one another,

6. but having different gifts according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith;

7. or ministry, in the ministry; or the one teaching, in the teaching;

8. or the one exhorting, in the encouragement; the one sharing, in simplicity; the one taking the lead, in diligence; the one showing mercy, in cheerfulness.

9.  Let love be without dissimulation, shrinking from evil, cleaving to the good,

10. in brotherly love to one another, loving fervently, having gone before one another in honor;

11. in diligence, not slothful, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;

12. in hope, rejoicing; in affliction, enduring; in prayer, steadfastly continuing;

13. imparting to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.

14. Bless those persecuting you; bless, and do not curse.

15. Rejoice with rejoicing ones, and weep with weeping ones;

16. minding the same thing toward one another, not minding high things, but yielding to the lowly. Do not become wise within yourselves.

17. Repay no one evil for evil, having provided right things before all men. Prov. 3:4

18. If possible, as far as is in you, seeking peace with all men;

19. not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to wrath, for it has been written, "Vengeance is Mine," "I will repay," says the Lord. Deut. 32:35

20. Then "if your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him drink; for doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head." Prov. 25:21, 22

21. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome the evil with good.  

## Romans 13

1. Let every soul be subject to higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, but the existing authorities have been ordained by God.

2. So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves.

3. For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it;

4. for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil.

5. Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.

6. For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing.   

7. Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.

8. Do not continue to owe anything, except to love one another. For the one loving the other has fulfilled the law.

9. For, "Do not commit adultery," "do not murder," "do not steal," do not bear false witness, "do not lust," Ex. 20:13-15, 17 and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Lev. 19:18

10. Love does not work evil to the neighbor. Then love is the fulfillment of law.   

11. Also this, knowing the time, that it is now the hour for you to be aroused from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.

12. The night is far gone, and the day has drawn near; then let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the weapons of the light.

13. Let us walk becomingly, as in the day, not in carousings and drunkennesses, not in co-habitation and lustful acts, not in fighting and envy.

14. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.  

## Romans 14

1. And receive the one who is weak in the faith, not to judgments of your thoughts.

2. One indeed believes to eat all things, but being weak, another one eats vegetables.

3. The one eating, do not despise the one not eating. And the one not eating, do not judge the one eating, for God received him.

4. Who are you judging another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.

5. One indeed judges a day above another day; and another one judges every day alike . Let each one be fully assured in his own mind.

6. The one minding the day, he minds it to the Lord. And the one not minding the day, he does not mind it to the Lord. The one eating, he eats to the Lord; for he gives thanks to God. And the one not eating, he does not eat to the Lord, and gives thanks to God.

7. For no one of us lives to himself and no one dies to himself.

8. For both if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Then both if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.

9. For this Christ both died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord over both the dead and the living.

10. But why do you judge your brother? Or why also do you despise your brother? For all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

11. For it has been written, " As I live, says the Lord, that every knee will bow to Me, and every tongue confess to God." Isa. 49:18; 45:23

12. So then each one of us will give account concerning himself to God.

13. Then let us no longer judge one another, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling-block or an offense toward a brother.

14. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing by itself is common; except to the one counting anything to be common, it is common.

15. But if your brother is grieved because of your food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not by your food destroy that one for whom Christ died.

16. Then do not let your good be spoken evil of.

17. For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

18. For the one serving Christ in these things is pleasing to God, and approved by men.

19. So then let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another.

20. Do not by your food undo the work of God. Truly, all things are clean, but it is bad to the man who eats through a stumbling-block.

21.  It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.

22. Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is the one not condemning himself in what he approves.

23. But the one doubting, if he eats, he has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.  

## Romans 15

1. But we, the strong ones, ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to please ourselves.

2. For let each one of us please his neighbor for good, to building up.

3. For also Christ did not please Himself, but even as it has been written, "The curses of those cursing You fell on Me." LXX-Psa. 68:10; MT-Psa. 69:9

4. For whatever things were written before were written for our instruction, that through patience and encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.   

5. And may the God of patience and encouragement give to you to mind the same thing among one another according to Christ Jesus,

6. that with one accord and with one mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.   

7. Because of this, receive one another as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.

8. And I say, Jesus Christ has become a minister of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers,

9. and for the nations to glorify God for mercy, even as it has been written, "Because of this I will confess to You in the nations, and I will give praise to Your name." Psa. 18:49

10. And again He says, "Rejoice, nations, with His people." Deut. 32:43

11. And again, "Praise the Lord, all the nations, and praise Him all the peoples." Psa. 117:1

12. And again Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse shall be, and He rising up to rule the nations; on Him nations will hope." Isa. 11:10   

13. And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, for you to abound in hope, in power of the Holy Spirit.   

14. But, my brothers, I myself also am persuaded concerning you, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge, being able to warn one another.

15. But I wrote to you more boldly, brothers, as reminding you in part, because of the grace given to me by God,

16. for me to be a minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, sacredly ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.   

17. Therefore I have boasting in Christ Jesus as to the things pertaining to God.

18. For I will not dare to speak of anything which Christ did not work out through me for the obedience of the nations in word and work,

19. in power of miracles and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God, so as for me to have fulfilled the preaching of the gospel of Christ from Jerusalem and in a circle as far as Illyricum.

20. And so eagerly striving to preach the gospel where Christ was not named, so that I should not build on another's foundation,

21. but even as it has been written, "They shall see, to whom nothing was announced concerning Him; and the ones that have not heard shall understand." Isa. 52:15   

22. Because of this I also was much hindered from coming to you,

23. but now having no more place in these regions, and having a longing to come to you for many years,

24. whenever I may go into Spain, I will come to you; for I hope in traveling through to see you and to be set forward there by you, if first I may be filled of you in part.

25. But now I am going to Jerusalem, doing service to the saints.

26. For Macedonia and Achaia thought it good to make certain gifts to the poor of the saints in Jerusalem.

27. For they thought it good, also being debtors of them; for if the nations shared in their spiritual things, they ought also to minister to them in the fleshly things.

28. Then completing and having sealed this fruit to them, I will go through you into Spain.

29. And I know that I will come to you in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ when I come.   

30. But I exhort you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,

31. that I be delivered from the disobedient ones in Judea, and that my ministry, which is to Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints,

32. that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and that I may be refreshed with you.

33. And the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.  

## Romans 16

1. But I commend our sister Phoebe to you, being a servant of the church in Cenchrea,

2. that you may receive her in the Lord, as is worthy of the saints, and may assist her in whatever thing she may need of you. For she also became a helper of many, and of myself.

3. Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

4. who laid down their neck for my soul, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the nations.

5. And greet the church at their house, and my beloved Epenetus, who is a firstfruit of Achaia for Christ.

6. Greet Mary, who did much labor for us.

7. Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and fellow prisoners, noted among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

8. Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

9. Greet Urbanus, our helper in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.

10. Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ; Greet those of Aristobulus.

11. Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of Narcissus, those being in the Lord.

12. Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those laboring in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has labored in many things in the Lord.

13. Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

14. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers with them.

15. Greet Philologus and Julias, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.

16. Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.   

17. And brothers I exhort you to watch those making divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.

18. For such ones do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by smooth speaking and flattering they deceive the hearts of those without guile.

19. For your obedience reached to all; therefore, I rejoice over you. But I desire you to be truly wise as to good, but simple toward evil.

20. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.   

21. Timothy, my fellowworker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, greet you.

22. I, Tertius, the one writing the epistle, greet you in the Lord.

23. Gaius, the host of all the church and me, greets you. Erastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus the brother, greet you.

24. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.   

25. Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the proclaiming of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery having been kept unvoiced during eternal times,

26. but now has been made plain, and by prophetic Scriptures, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations;

27. to the only wise God through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever. Amen.
