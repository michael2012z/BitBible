# Joshua

## Joshua 1

1. And it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,

2. My servant Moses is dead. And now rise up, cross over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.

3. Every place on which the sole of your foot shall tread, I have given it to you, as I spoke to Moses.

4. From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun, shall be your border.

5. No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor will I forsake you.

6. Be strong and brave. For you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.

7. Only be strong and very brave, so that you may take heed to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may act wisely wherever you go.

8. This hook of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, and you shall meditate on it by day and by night, so that you shall be on guard to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall prosper your way, and then you shall act wisely.

9. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and brave. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for Jehovah your God is with you in all places where you go.   

10. Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

11. Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare food for you. For within three days you are crossing this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you, to possess it.

12. And Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, saying,

13. Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has given you rest, and He has given to you this land;

14. your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses has given to you beyond the Jordan. But you shall cross over armed before your brothers, all the mighty warriors, and shall help them,

15. until Jehovah has given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and they, even they have possessed the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them Then you may return to the land of your possession, and may possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to you beyond the Jordan toward the rising of the sun.   

16. And they answered Joshua, saying, We will do all that you command us; and we will go everywhere you shall send us.

17. According to all we heard from Moses, so we will listen to you. Surely Jehovah your God is with you, as He has been with Moses.

18. Whoever rebels against your mouth, and will not listen to +your commands in all that you say to him, he shall be put to death. Only, be strong and brave.  

## Joshua 2

1. And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men out of Shittim to spy secretly, saying, Go look over the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a woman, a harlot; and her name was Rahab. And they lay down there.

2. And it was reported to the King of Jericho saying, Behold, men have come here tonight from the sons of Israel, to search the land.

3. And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come in to you, who have come into your house. For they have come in to search out all the land.

4. And the woman took the two men and hid them, and said, This way the men came in to me, but I did not know from where they were.

5. And it happened as the gate was to be shut at dark, even the men went out. I do not know where they have gone. You go after them, and hurry, for you may overtake them.

6. But she made them go up on the roof, and hid them with stalks of flax, which she arranged on the roof.

7. And the men went after them the way of the Jordan, by the fords. And they shut the gate afterwards, when the pursuers had gone after them.   

8. And before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof.

9. And she said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given the land to you, and that your terror has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you.

10. For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds before you, as you were going out of Egypt; also that which you have done to two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan; to Sihon, and to Og, whom you destroyed.

11. And we have heard, and our heart has melted, and there not still rises spirit in any man, because of you. For Jehovah your God, He is God in the heavens above, and in the earth below.

12. And now, please swear by me by Jehovah, since I have dealt with you in kindness, that you will also deal with my father's house in kindness, and shall give to me a true token;

13. and shall keep alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they own and shall deliver our souls from death.

14. And the men said to her, Our life is yours. If you do not tell this business of ours, then it shall be, when Jehovah gives this land to us that we shall deal with you in kindness and truth.

15. Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was in the side of the wall, and she lived in the wall.

16. And she said to them, Go to the mountain lest the pursuers come upon you. And you shall hide there three days until the pursuers return; and afterward you shall go on your way.

17. And the men said to her, We will be guiltless from this oath of yours which you made us swear.

18. Behold, we are coming into the land; you shall bind this scarlet thread of line in the window by which you have let us down. And you shall gather your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's house to you, to the house.

19. And it shall be, anyone who goes outside from the doors of your house his blood shall be on his head, and we shall be innocent. And anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.

20. But if you reveal this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless from your oath which you make us swear.

21. And she said, Let it be according to your words. And she sent them away. And they went. And she bound the line of scarlet thread in the window.   

22. And they departed and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. And the pursuers searched in all the way, but did not find them .

23. And the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and crossed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and reported to him all that had happened to them.

24. And they said to Joshua, Surely Jehovah has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land have melted before us.  

## Joshua 3

1. And Joshua rose up early in the morning. And they moved from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel. And they stayed there before they crossed over.

2. And it happened, at the end of three days, the officers passed into the midst of the camp.

3. And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, and the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place and shall go after it.

4. Only, keep a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. You shall not come near it, so that you may know the way in which you are to go. For you have not crossed over this way yesterday and the day before.

5. And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.

6. And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and go before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.   

7. And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel, so that they shall know that as I was with Moses, I am with you.

8. And you shall command the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan you shall stand still in the Jordan.

9. And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Come near here and hear the words of Jehovah your God.

10. And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living God is among you. And He shall certainly expel from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

11. Behold, the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of all the earth shall pass over before you into the Jordan.

12. And now, take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel one man for each tribe.

13. And it shall be, when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters which come down from above. And they shall stand in one heap.   

14. And it happened, as the people moved from their tents to cross over the Jordan, and as the priests bore the ark of the covenant before the people,

15. and as those bearing the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the waters (and the Jordan was full, over all its banks all the days of harvest),

16. that the waters stood still, those coming down from above rose up into a heap, very far above the city Adam, which is beside Zaretan; and those going down by the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite to Jericho.

17. And the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan. And all Israel crossed over on dry ground until all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan.  

## Joshua 4

1. And it happened, when all the nation had completely crossed over the Jordan, Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,

2. Take twelve men for you out of the people, one man of each tribe.

3. And charge them, saying, Take twelve stones from this place, from the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the feet of the priests were fixed. And you shall carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place which you stay the night.

4. And Joshua called to the twelve men whom he had readied from the sons of Israel, one man out of each tribe.

5. And Joshua said to them, Cross over before the ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each man of you lift up one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,

6. that this shall be a sign among you, when your children ask hereafter, saying, What are these stones to you?

7. You shall say to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as it crossed over into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones are for a memorial to the sons of Israel all the days.

8. And the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and crossed over with them to the lodging place, and laid them down there;

9. even the twelve stones that Joshua lifted up in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant stood firm. And they are there until this day.   

10. And the priests bearing the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished everything that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastened and crossed over.

11. And it happened, when the people had finished crossing over, the ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over before the people.

12. And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them;

13. about forty thousand armed men of the army crossed over before Jehovah for battle, to the plains of Jericho.

14. In that day Jehovah made Joshua great in the sight of all Israel. And they feared him all the days of his life, even as they feared Moses.

15. And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,

16. Order the priests who carry the ark of the testimony, that they rise out of the Jordan.

17. And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Rise out of the Jordan.

18. And it happened when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the feet of the priests had been lifted to the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as before.

19. And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and camped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.   

20. And the twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan were raised up in Gilgal by Joshua.

21. And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, When your sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What do these stones mean ?

22. Then you shall make your sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land,

23. because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you crossed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which He dried up before you until we crossed over;

24. so that all the people of the land shall know that the hand of Jehovah is strong, so that you may fear Jehovah your God all the days.  

## Joshua 5

1. And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan, toward the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the sea, heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel, until they crossed over, their heart was melted. And there was not any more spirit in them before the sons of Israel.

2. At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make for yourself flint knives, and again circumcise the sons of Israel, the second time.

3. And Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

4. And this is the reason Joshua circumcised: All the people who had come out of Egypt, who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness, in the way, as they came out of Egypt.

5. For all the people who had come out were circumcised. And all the people who were born in the wilderness, in the way, as they came out from Egypt, had not been circumcised.

6. For the sons of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who had come out of Egypt were consumed, those who did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah had sworn to them not to show them the land which Jehovah swore to their fathers, to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey; these were consumed.

7. And He raised their sons up in their place. Joshua circumcised them, for they had been uncircumcised; for they had not been circumcised in the way.

8. And it happened, when all the nation had finished being circumcised, they remained in their places in the camp until they revived.

9. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Today I have rolled the reproach of Egypt off of you. And he called the name of that place Gilgal to this day.   

10. And the sons of Israel camped in Gilgal, and prepared the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho.

11. And they ate the old grain of the land on the morrow of the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain , in this same day.

12. And the manna ceased on the next day after they ate of the old grain of the land. And there was no more manna to the sons of Israel, but they ate the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.   

13. And it happened, when Joshua was beside Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked. And, behold! A Man stood in front of him, and His drawn sword was in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us, or for our foes?

14. And He said, No, for I now come as the Commander of the army of Jehovah. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped. And he said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His slave?

15. And the Commander of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua, Take your shoe off your foot, for the place on which you are standing is holy. And Joshua did so.  

## Joshua 6

1. And Jericho was closed, and was shut in from the face of the sons of Israel; no one going out, and no one coming in.

2. And Jehovah said to Joshua, See I have given Jericho and its king, mighty warriors, into your hand.

3. And you shall go around the city, all the men of battle, going around the city once; so you shall do six days.

4. And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark. And on the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

5. And it shall be, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the ram's horn, all the people shall shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat; and the people shall go up, each man in front of him.   

6. And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of Jehovah.

7. And he said to the people, Pass on, go around the city, and he who is shall go on before the ark of Jehovah.

8. And it happened, when Joshua spoke to the people, the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the ram's horns before Jehovah passed on and blew with the ram's horn. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.

9. And he who was armed went before the priests blowing the ram's horns. And the rear guard after the ark, going on and blowing with the trumpets.

10. And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor shall there go from your mouth a word until the day I say to you, Shout! Then you shall shout.

11. And the ark of Jehovah went around the city, going around one time. And they came into the camp, and remained in the camp.

12. And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests bore the ark of Jehovah.

13. And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the ram's horns were walking before the ark of Jehovah, going on, and were blowing with the rams' horns. And he who was armed went before them. And the rear guard went behind the ark of Jehovah, going on and blowing with the rams' horns.

14. And they circled the city on the second day one time, and returned to the camp. So they did six days.

15. And it happened on the seventh day, they rose early, at the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in the same way. Only on that day they circled the city seven times.

16. And it happened at the seventh time the priests blew with the rams' horns. And Joshua said to the people, Shout! For Jehovah has given you the city.   

17. And the city shall be devoted to Jehovah, it and all that are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.

18. And you shall certainly keep clear of the cursed things, that you not become accursed by taking from the cursed things, and shall make the camp of Israel become accursed, and trouble it.

19. And all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, they are holy to Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.

20. And the people shouted, and blew with the ram's horns, and it happened, when the people heard the sound of the ram's horn, the people shouted a great shout. And the wall fell under it; and the people went up into the city, each man in front of him; and they captured the city.

21. And they destroyed all that was in the city, from man even to woman, from young even to aged, and to ox, and sheep, and ass, by the mouth of the sword.

22. And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring the woman out from there, and all whom she has, as you have sworn to her.

23. And the young men, the spies, went in and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all whom she had; yea, they brought all her family, and set them outside the camp of Israel.

24. And they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they gave the silver and the gold, and the vessels of bronze, and of iron, to the treasury of the house of Jehovah.

25. And Joshua kept alive Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father, and all whom she had. And she lives in the midst of Israel to this day. For she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

26. And at that time Joshua adjured, saying, Cursed be the man who rises up before the face of Jehovah and builds this city of Jericho. He shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and he shall set up its doors in his youngest son.

27. And Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.  

## Joshua 7

1. And the sons of Israel committed a sin in the cursed thing. And Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah took the cursed thing. And the anger of Jehovah glowed against the sons of Israel.

2. And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.

3. And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Do not let all the people go up. Let about two thousand men, or about three thousand men, go up, and they shall strike Ai. Do not cause all the people to labor there, for they are few.

4. And about three thousand men of the people went up there And they fled before the men of Ai.

5. And the men of Ai struck about thirty six men of them, and pursued them before the gate to Shebarim. And they struck them in the descent. And the heart of the people was melted, and became as water.   

6. And Joshua tore his clothing, and fell on his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they threw dust on their heads.

7. And Joshua said, Oh Lord Jehovah, why have You at all caused this people to cross over the Jordan to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? And, Oh that we have been willing, and that we had dwelt beyond the Jordan!

8. Oh Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned its back before its enemies?

9. And the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear, and shall come around against us, and shall cut off our name out of the earth. And what shall You do for Your great name?   

10. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Get up! Why do you fall on your face this way?

11. Israel has sinned, and they also have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them, and have also taken of the cursed things, and have also stolen, and also deceived, and also put it among their stuff.

12. And the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before their enemies; they have turned the back before their enemies because they have become cursed. I will not be with you again if you do not destroy the cursed things from among you.

13. Rise up, sanctify the people, and you shall say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. For so says Jehovah, the God of Israel, A cursed thing is among you, Israel; you are not able to stand before your enemies until you take away the cursed thing from among you.

14. And you shall be brought near in the morning, by your tribes. And it shall be, the tribe which Jehovah takes shall draw near by families. And the family which Jehovah takes shall draw near by households. And the household which Jehovah takes shall draw near by men.

15. And it shall be, he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah and because he has committed folly in Israel.   

16. And Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near by its tribes. And the tribe of Judah was taken.

17. And he brought the family of Judah near; and he took the family of the Zarhites. And he brought near the family of the Zarhites by men, and Zabdi was taken.

18. And he brought near his household by men, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

19. And Joshua said to Achan, My son, I beg you, give glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and give thanks to Him, and please tell me what you have done. Do not hide it from me.

20. And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Truly I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and this I have done:

21. When I saw among the spoil a goodly robe of Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold, one of fifty shekels in weight, then I lusted after them, and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the earth, in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.

22. And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent, and the silver under it.

23. And they took them out of the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.

24. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the robe, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his ass, and his flock, and his tent, and all that he had. And they made them go up to the valley of Achor.

25. And Joshua said, How you have troubled us! Jehovah shall trouble you today! And all Israel threw stones at him, and they burned them with fire, and they stoned them with stones.

26. And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. And Jehovah turned back from the heat of His anger. On this account the name of that place is The Valley of Grief until this day.  

## Joshua 8

1. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not fear, nor be afraid. Take all the people of war with you, and rise up, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land into your hand.

2. And you shall do to Ai and to its king as you have done to Jericho and its king. Only, its spoil and its cattle you shall take for yourselves. Set yourself an ambush for the city behind it.   

3. And Joshua rose up, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose thirty thousand men, mighty warriors and sent them away by night.

4. And he commanded them, saying, See, you will be an ambush against the city, behind the city. You shall not go very far off from the city, and all of you shall be ready.

5. And I and all the people with me shall draw near to the city. And it shall be, when they come out to meet us as at the first, and we have fled before them,

6. and they will come out after us until we have drawn them out of the city For they will say, They are fleeing before us, as at the first. And we will flee from them;

7. then you shall rise from the ambush and shall occupy the city. And Jehovah your God shall give it into your hand.

8. And it shall be when you capture the city, you shall burn the city with fire. You shall do according to the word of Jehovah. See, I have commanded you.

9. And Joshua sent them away, and they went to the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai. And Joshua remained that night in the midst of the people.

10. And Joshua rose early in the morning and called up the people, and they went up, he and the elders of Israel in the sight of the people of Ai.

11. And all the people of war with him went up and drew near, and came before the city. And they camped on the north of Ai, and the valley was between him and Ai.

12. And he took about five thousand men and set them as an ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city.

13. And they set the people, all the camp on the north of the city; and its rear on the west of the city. And Joshua went into the middle of the valley on that night.

14. And it happened, when the king of Ai saw, the men of the city rose early and hurried to go out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed time before the plain. He did not know that an ambush was against him behind the city.

15. And Joshua and all Israel were stricken before them, and they fled the way of the wilderness.

16. And all the people in the city were called to chase them. And they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away out of the city.

17. And there was not a man left in Ai and Bethel who had not gone out after Israel. And they left the city open, and chased Israel.

18. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai. For I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.

19. And the ambush rose up quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered the city, and took it. And they hastened and burned the city with fire.

20. And the men of Ai looked behind them, and saw; and, behold! The smoke of the city had gone up into the sky. And there was no power in them to flee here or there. And the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.

21. And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city had gone up. And they turned back and struck the men of Ai.

22. And the others came out from the city to meet them. and they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that. And they struck them until not was left to them a survivor, not one that escaped.   

23. And they caught the king of Ai and brought him alive to Joshua.

24. And it happened, when Israel had made an end to slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, even in the wilderness where they pursued them (and they all of them fell by the mouth of the sword until they were consumed) all Israel turned back to Ai, and struck it with the mouth of the sword.

25. And all who fell during that day, of men and of women, were twelve thousand, all the men of Ai.

26. And Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

27. Only, Israel seized for themselves the livestock, and the plunder of the city, according to the word of Jehovah which He commanded Joshua.

28. And Joshua burned Ai, and made it a heap forever, a desolation to this day.

29. And he hanged the king of Ai on the tree until evening time. And at sundown Joshua commanded, and they took his dead body down from the tree, and threw it into the opening of the gate of the city; and raised over it a great heap of stones until this day.   

30. Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,

31. as Moses, the servant of Jehovah, commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses; an altar of whole stones, on which had been wielded no iron. And they offered up on it burnt offerings to Jehovah, and offered peace offerings.

32. And he wrote there on the stones the copy of the law of Moses which he had written in the presence of the sons of Israel.

33. And all Israel, and its elders, and authorities, and its judges were standing on this side, the alien as well as the homeborn, and on that of the ark, before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.

34. And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that was written in the book of the law.

35. There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the aliens that walked among them.  

## Joshua 9

1. And it happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hills and in the Lowlands, and in all the coast of the Great Sea in front of Lebanon, heard of it, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,

2. they with one mouth gathered themselves to fight with Joshua and with Israel.   

3. And the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai.

4. And they acted slyly, and they went and acted like envoys, and took old sacks for their asses, and old wineskins, even torn and bound up;

5. and old and patched sandals on their feet; and old garments on them. And all their provision of bread was dry; it was crumbs.

6. And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal. And they said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a distant land. And now cut a covenant with us.

7. And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps you are living in our midst, and how shall we cut a covenant with you?

8. And they said to Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are you? And from where do you come?

9. And they said to him, Your servants have come from a very distant land, because of the name of Jehovah your God, for we have heard of His fame, and all that He has done in Egypt.

10. Also what He has done to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og the king of Bashan who was in Ashtaroth.

11. And our elders and all the people of our land spoke to us, saying, Take provisions in your hand for the way, and go to meet them. And you shall say to them, We are your servants; and now, cut a covenant with us.

12. We provided ourselves with this hot bread out of our houses on the day we came out to go to you. And now, behold, it is dry and it is crumbs.

13. And these are the wineskins which we filled new; and, behold, they have torn. And these garments of ours, and our sandals, have become old because of the exceeding greatness of the way.

14. And the men took of their provision, and did not ask at the mouth of Jehovah.   

15. And Joshua made peace with them, and cut a covenant with them, to keep them alive. And the leaders of the congregation swore to them.

16. And at the end of three days they had cut a covenant with them. And it happened that they heard that they were their neighbors, and they were living in their midst.

17. And the sons of Israel pulled up and came to their cities on the third day. And their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.

18. And the sons of Israel did not strike them, for the leaders of the congregation swore to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the leaders.

19. And all the leaders said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel; and now we cannot touch them.

20. We shall do this to them, and shall keep them alive, and wrath shall not be on us because of the oath which we have sworn to them.

21. And the leaders said to them, They shall live and be woodcutters, and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders spoke to them.   

22. And Joshua called for them; and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, yet you are living in our midst?

23. And now, you are cursed, and none of you shall fail to be slaves, and woodcutters, and drawers of water for the house of my God.

24. And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was certainly told to your servants what Jehovah your God commanded His servant Moses, to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; and we were greatly afraid for ourselves, because of you. And we did this thing.

25. And now, behold, we are in your hand. Do whatever is good, and as is right in your eyes to do.

26. And he did so to them, and delivered them from the hand of the sons of Israel. And they did not Kill them.

27. And on that day Joshua made them woodcutters, and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah at the place which He should choose, to this day.  

## Joshua 10

1. And it happened, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had destroyed it (as he had done to Jericho and to its king, so he had done to Ai and to her king) and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were in their midst,

2. they were greatly afraid because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.

3. And Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,

4. Come up to me and help me. And we shall strike Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.

5. And the five kings of the Amorites assembled, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, they and all their camps. And they camped against Gibeon, and fought against it.

6. And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, and to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not withdraw your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites living in the hills have gathered against us.   

7. And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, even all the mighty warriors.

8. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you.

9. And Joshua came to them suddenly (he had traveled all night from Gilgal)

10. and Jehovah troubled them before Israel, and struck them with a great blow at Gibeon, and He pursued by the way of the ascent of Bethhoron, and struck them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.

11. And it happened, as they fled from the face of Israel, they were in the descent of Bethhoron, even Jehovah cast great stones on them out of the heavens, to Azekah; and they died. The many who died by the hailstones were more than the sons of Israel had killed by the sword.

12. Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah gave the Amorites up before the sons of Israel; and he said, Sun, stand still before the eyes of Israel in Gibeon! And, Moon stand still in the valley of Aijalon!

13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stood still , until the nation was avenged on its foes. Is it not written in the Book of the Upright? Yea, the sun stood still in the middle of the heavens, and did not hasten to go down for a full day.

14. And there has not been a day such as that, before it or after it; for Jehovah listened to the voice of a man. For Jehovah fought for Israel.   

15. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

16. And these five kings fled, and were hidden in a cave at Makkedah.

17. And it was told to Joshua, saying, the five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.

18. And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to watch them.

19. And you, do not stand still . Pursue your enemies, and you shall strike the hindmost of them. Do not allow them to go into their cities, for Jehovah your God has given them into your hand.

20. And it happened, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished destroying them with a very great blow, until they were completely destroyed, and the remnant of them who escaped went into the fortified cities,

21. that all the people returned to the camp in peace, to Joshua at Makkedah. Not one sharpened his tongue against the sons of Israel, against any man.

22. And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out to me these five kings from the cave.

23. And they did so, and brought out to him these five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.

24. And it happened, when they brought out these kings to Joshua, Joshua called to every man of Israel and said to the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, Draw near, set your feet on the necks of these kings. And they drew near and set their feet on their necks.

25. And Joshua said to them, Do not fear nor be afraid. Be strong and brave, for so Jehovah shall do to all your enemies with whom you are fighting.

26. And afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hung them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening.

27. And it happened at the time of the going of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had been hidden, and put great stones on the mouth of the cave until this very day.   

28. And that day Joshua captured Makkedah. And he struck it by the mouth of the sword, and he destroyed its king, them, and every person in it. He did not leave a survivor. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.

29. And Joshua passed on, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah. And he fought with Libnah.

30. And Jehovah also gave it into the hand of Israel, and its king. And they struck it by the mouth of the sword, and every person in it; he did not leave a survivor in it. And he did to its king as he did to the king of Jericho.

31. And Joshua passed on, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish. And they camped against it, and fought against it.

32. And Jehovah gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day, and struck it by the mouth of the sword, and every person in it, according to all that he did to Libnah.

33. Then Horam the king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people until there was not left to him a survivor.

34. And Joshua passed on, and all Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon. And they camped against it, and fought against it,

35. and captured it on that day, and struck it with the mouth of the sword. And he destroyed every person in it on that day, according to all that he did to Lachish.

36. And Joshua went on, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it,

37. and captured it, and struck it by the mouth of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and every person in it; he did not leave a survivor, according to all that he did to Eglon, and destroyed it and every person in it.

38. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.

39. And they captured it and its king, and all its cities. And they struck them by the mouth of the sword, and destroyed every person in it; he did not leave a survivor. As he did to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; even as he did to Libnah, and to its king.

40. And Joshua struck all the land: the heights and the Negeb, and the Lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings; he did not leave a survivor, but he destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.

41. And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea, even to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even to Gibeon.

42. And Joshua captured all these kings in their land at one time, for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.

43. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal.  

## Joshua 11

1. And it happened, when Jabin the king of Hazor heard, he sent to Jobab the king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

2. and to the kings that were on the north of the heights, and in the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the low country, and in the hills of Dor on the west;

3.  to the Canaanite on the east, and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the heights, and the Hivite below Hermon, in the land of Mizpeh.

4. And they went out, they and all their camps with them, a people plentiful as the sand on the seashore in number, and very many horses and chariots.

5. And all these kings met together. And they came and camped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.

6. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not fear before them, for about this time tomorrow I will give all of them up wounded before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

7. And Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom. And they suddenly fell on them.

8. And Jehovah gave them into Israel's hand, and they struck them, and pursued them to the great Sidon, and to the burning waters, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. And they struck them until he did not have a survivor left to them.

9. And Joshua did to them as Jehovah said to him. He hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.   

10. And Joshua returned and captured Hazor at that time. And he struck its king by the sword; for Hazor was formerly head of all these kingdoms.

11. And they struck every person in it by the mouth of the sword. He destroyed them , he did not leave anyone breathing; and he burned Hazor with fire.

12. And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings. And he struck them by the mouth of the sword. He destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.

13. But as for all the cities which stood by their mounds, Israel did not burn them; but Joshua only burned Hazor.

14. And the sons of Israel seized for themselves all the plunder of these cities, and the livestock. But they struck every human being by the mouth of the sword, until they had destroyed them; they did not leave anyone breathing.   

15. As Jehovah commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He did not turn aside from anything of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.

16. And Joshua took all this land: the heights, and all the Negeb, and all the land of Goshen, and the Lowlands, and the Arabah and the mountains of Israel, and its lowlands,

17. from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon, below Mount Hermon. And he took all their kings, and struck them, and killed them.

18. And Joshua made war many days with all those kings.

19. There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites, inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.

20. For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, so that they should come against Israel in battle, so that they might be destroyed, so that they might have no favor, but that He might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

21. At that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anah, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them with their cities.

22. There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only some remained in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.

23. And Joshua took the whole of the land, according to all that Jehovah had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it for Israel according to their divisions, by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.  

## Joshua 12

1. And these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel struck, and they seized their land beyond the Jordan, at the sunrising, from the river Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:

2. Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and from its valley floor , and half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;

3. and from the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south under the Slopes of Pisgah;

4. and the border of Og the king of Bashan, of the rest of the giants, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

5. and reigned in Mount Hermon and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon the king of Heshbon.

6. Moses the servant of Jehovah and the sons of Israel struck them. And Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.   

7. And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak that goes up to Seir, which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

8. in the mountains, and in the Lowlands, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negeb; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

9. the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;

10. the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

11. the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

12. the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

13. the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

14. the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

15. the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

16. the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

17. the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

18. the king of Aphek, one; the king of Sharon, one;

19. the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

20. the king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

21. the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

22. the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;

23. the king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;

24. the king of Tirzah, one. All the kings were thirty one.  

## Joshua 13

1. And Joshua was old, going on in days. And Jehovah said to him, You have become aged, you are far along in days; yet very much land remains to be possessed.

2. This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,

3. from Shihor which fronts on Egypt, and to the border of Ekron northward (it is counted to the Canaanites) five lords of the Philistines, of Gaza, of Ashdod, of Ashkelon, of Gath, and of Ekron; also the Avim.

4. From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah which belongs to the Sidonians; to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;

5. and the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the entering to Hamath;

6. all the inhabitants of the hills, from Lebanon to the burning waters; all the Sidonians; I will expel them before the sons of Israel: Only, cause it to fall to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.   

7. Now, then, divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

8. With him the Reubenites, and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave to them beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to them;

9. from Aroer on the lip of the river Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, to Dibon;

10. and all the cities of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the sons of Ammon;

11. and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites, and of the Maachathite, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salcah;

12. all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei; he remained of the remnant of the giants. And Moses struck them and expelled them.

13. But the sons of Israel did not expel the Geshurites and the Maachathite, but Geshur and Maachathites live in the midst of Israel until today.

14. Only, he has not given an inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The fire offerings of Jehovah the God of Israel are its inheritance, as He has spoken to it.

15. And Moses gave to the tribe of the sons of Reuben, for their families;

16. and their border was from Aroer on the lip of the river Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;

17. Heshbon, and all its cities in the tableland; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon;

18. and Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath;

19. and Kirjath-aim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mountain of the valley;

20. and Beth-peor, and the Slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth;

21. and all the cities of the tableland, and all the kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the rulers of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, chiefs of Sihon, the inhabitants of the land.

22. And the sons of Israel killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword, among their slain.

23. And the border of the sons of Reuben was from the Jordan, and its border. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben for their families, the cities and their villages.

24. And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, for their families:

25. And their border was to Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half of the land of the sons of Ammon, to Aroer, which is before Rabbah;

26. and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;

27. and in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon the king of Heshbon; the Jordan and its border, to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth, beyond the Jordan, eastward.

28. This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad, for their families, the cities and their villages.

29. And Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh. And it was to the half of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, for their families:

30. and their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, and all the small towns of Jair in Bashan, sixty cities;

31. and the half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, belonged to the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, to the half of the sons of Machir for their families.

32. These are they whom Moses caused to inherit in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, opposite Jericho, eastward.

33. But Moses did not give an inheritance to the tribe of Levi. Jehovah the God of Israel Himself is their inheritance, as He has spoken to them.  

## Joshua 14

1. And these are they of the sons of Israel who inherited in the land of Canaan, whom Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel caused to inherit.

2. Their inheritance was by lot, as Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and the half tribe;

3. for Moses had given the inheritance of two of the tribes and the half tribe, beyond the Jordan; and he did not give any inheritance to the Levites among them.

4. For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in , with the open land around them for their livestock and for their substance,

5. as Jehovah commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did, and they allotted the land.   

6. And the sons of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, You know the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of God as to me and as to you in Kadesh-barnea.

7. I was a son of forty years when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land. And I brought him back word as it was in my heart.

8. But my brothers who went up with me caused the heart of the people to melt, yet I fully followed after Jehovah my God.

9. And Moses swore in that day, saying, Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and for your sons forever, because you have fully followed after Jehovah my God.

10. And now, behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as He said, these forty five years since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses, when Israel went in the wilderness. And now, behold, today I am a son of eighty five years;

11. yet I am as strong today as in the day Moses sent me. As my strength was then, so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come in.

12. And now, give to me this mountain, of which Jehovah spoke in that day, for you heard in that day how the son of Anak were there, and great walled cities. If Jehovah shall be with me, then I shall expel them, as Jehovah has spoken.

13. And Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.

14. Therefore, Hebron has belonged to Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, for an inheritance to this day, because he fully followed after Jehovah the God of Israel.

15. And the name of Hebron before was City of Arba; that one was a great man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.  

## Joshua 15

1. And the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah for their families was to the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin southward, in the extreme south.

2. And their south border was from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looked southward.

3. And it went out southward to the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed on to Zin, and went up on the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed to Hezron, and went up toward Adar, and turned toward Karkaa,

4. and passed on to Azmon, and went out by the torrent of Egypt; and the boundary line was at the sea. This shall be your south border.

5. And the east border was the Salt Sea to the end of the Jordan; and the border on the north side was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan.

6. And the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed on the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben;

7. And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and northward looking toward Gilgal, which is opposite to the ascent of Adummim, which is the south side of the torrent; and the border passed to the waters of En-shemesh, and its boundary line was at Enrogel.

8. And the border went up to the valley of the son of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite on the south (it is Jerusalem) and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom westward at the far end of the Valley of the Giants northward.

9. And the border was drawn from the top of the mount to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah; and it went up to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah (it is Kirjath-jearim).

10. And the border turned around from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and passed toward the side of Mount Jearim on the north (it is Chesalon) and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;

11. and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward; and the border was drawn to Shikkeron, and passed along to Mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel. And the boundary line was at the Sea.

12. And the west border was to the Great Sea, and its coast. This is the border of the sons of Judah all around, for their families.   

13. And he gave a portion to Caleb the son of Jephunneh among the sons of Judah, according to the command of Jehovah to Joshua: the City of Arba, the father of Anak; it is Hebron.

14. And Caleb expelled from there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the sons of Anak.

15. And he went up there to the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir formerly was the City of Sepher.

16. And Caleb said, He who strikes the City of Sepher, and captures it, I shall give my daughter Achsah to him for a wife.

17. And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. And He gave his daughter Achsah to him for a wife.

18. And it happened, as she came, that she persuaded him to ask from her father a field. And she dismounted from the ass, and Caleb said to her, What do you desire ?

19. And she said, Give a blessing to me. You have given me the land of the south, then you shall give to me springs of water. And he gave to her the upper springs and the lower springs.   

20. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah, for their families:

21. And the cities at the furthest border of the tribe of the sons of Judah were to the border of Edom in the south: Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

22. and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

23. and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

24. Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

25. and Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

26. Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

27. and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet,

28. and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Bizjothjah,

## Joshua 16

1. And the lot of the sons of Joseph went out from the Jordan at Jericho, to the waters of Jericho eastward, to the wilderness which went from Jericho to the hills of Bethel.

2. And it went from Bethel to Luz, and passed on to the border of the Archites, to Ataroth;

3. and went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth-horon the lower, and to Gezer, and its boundary line was at the sea.

4. And Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, inherited.   

5. And the border of the sons of Ephraim was by their families; the border of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar to Beth-horon the upper.

6. And the border went out at the sea to Michmethah on the north; and the border went around eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it eastward to Janohah;

7. and went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and touched on Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.

8. From Tappuah, the border went westward to the river Kanah, and its boundary line was at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, for their families.

9. And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim were in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages.

10. And they did not expel the Canaanite who lived in Gezer. And the Canaanite lives in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and is serving under tribute.  

## Joshua 17

1. And the lot came for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the first-born of Joseph, to Machir the first-born of Manasseh, father of Gilead, for he had been a man of battle, and he had Gilead and Bashan.

2. And there was a lot remaining for the sons of Manasseh, for their families, for the sons of Abiezer, and for the sons of Helek, and for the sons of Asriel, and for the sons of Shechem, and for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida; these being the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

3. But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. And these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

4. And they drew near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give to us an inheritance among our brothers; and at the mouth of Jehovah he gave to them an inheritance among their father's brothers.

5. And ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides that from the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan;

6. because the daughters of Manasseh had inherited an inheritance among his sons; and the land of Gilead belonged to the sons of Manasseh who remained.   

7. And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, which fronts on Shechem. And the border went up to the right to the inhabitants of Entappuah.

8. The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim.

9. And the border went down to the river Kanah, south of the river; these cities of Ephraim were in the midst of the cities of Manasseh, and the border of Manasseh was on the north of the river, and its boundary line was at the sea.

10. Southward, it was Ephraim's. And northward, it was Manasseh's, and the sea was its border. And they met in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

11. And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean and its daughter-villages, and Ibleam and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Endor and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; three regions.

12. But the sons of Manasseh had not been able to occupy these cities, for the Canaanite determined to live in this land.

13. And it happened, when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not completely expel them.   

14. And the sons of Joseph spoke with Joshua, saying, Why have you given to me one lot and one portion as an inheritance, since I am a numerous people? For Jehovah has blessed me until now.

15. And Joshua said to them, If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest for yourself, and you shall cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzite, and of the giants, if Mount Ephraim is too narrow for you.

16. And the sons of Joseph said, The hills will not be found for us. And every Canaanite who lives in the land of the valley has a chariot of iron, those that are of Beth-shean and its daughter-villages, and of him who is in the valley of Jezreel.

17. And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a numerous people, and have great power; you shall not have one lot,

18. because the hill is yours; because it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and its outer limits shall be yours; for you shall expel the Canaanite, even though it has chariots of iron; even though it is strong.  

## Joshua 18

1. And all the company of the sons of Israel were gathered at Shiloh. And they established the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land had been subdued before them.   

2. And seven tribes were left among the sons of Israel who had not shared their inheritance.

3. And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Until when will you fail to go in to possess the land which He, Jehovah the God of your fathers, has given to you?

4. Give from among you three men of a tribe, and I shall send them. And they shall go up and down through the land, and map it according to their inheritance; and then come to me.

5. And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall stay within their border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay within their border on the north.

6. And you shall map the land in seven parts, and shall bring it to me here. And I shall cast a lot for you here before Jehovah our God.

7. For there shall be no portion to the Levites among you, for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance. And Gad, and Reuben, and the half tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to them.

8. And the men rose up and went. And Joshua commanded those who were going to map out the land, saying, Go, and walk up and down through the land, and map it, and return to me. And I will cast a lot for you here before Jehovah at Shiloh.

9. And the men passed through the land, and mapped it by cities into seven parts, in a book. And they came to Joshua, to the camp at Shiloh.

10. And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah. And Joshua apportioned the land to the sons of Israel there, according to their divisions.   

11. And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up, according to their families, and the border of their lot went out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.

12. And their border was at the north side from the Jordan, and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hills westward; and its boundary line was at the wilderness of Beth-aven;

13. and the border went up from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (it is Bethel) southward, and the border went down to Atarothadar, near the hill that is on the south of the lower Beth-horon;

14. and the border was drawn and went around to the sea coast southward, from the hill which fronts on Beth-horon southward; and its boundary line was at the city of Baal it is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the sons of Judah; this is the west side.

15. And the south side was from the end of Kirjath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.

16. and the border went down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the Valley of the Giants northward, and went down the valley of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite on the south, and went down to En-rogel.

17. And it was drawn from the north and went out to En-shemesh, and went out toward Geliloth, which is across from the ascent of Adummim, and went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,

18. and passed on to the side opposite to the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.

19. And the border passed on to the side of Beth-hoglah northward, and the boundary line was at the north tongue of the Salt Sea, to the extreme south of the Jordan; this was the southern border.

20. And the Jordan borders it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to its borders all around, according to their families.

21. And the cities for the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, by their families, were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

22. and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

9. The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was out of the portion of the sons of Judah. For the part of the sons of Judah was too much for them. Therefore, the sons of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance.   

10. And the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the border of their inheritance was to Sarid.

11. And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the torrent in front of Jokneam,

12. and turned east from Sarid toward the rising of the sun, to the border of The Flames of Tabor, and goes out to Daberath, and goes up the Japhia.

20. and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

21. and Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.

34. And the border turns west toward Aznoth-tabor, and goes out from there to Hukkok, and reached to Zebulun on the south side, and reaches to Asher on the west side, and to Judah on Jordan toward the rising of the sun;

35. and the fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

48. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan by their families, these cities and their villages.

50. According to the mouth of Jehovah, they gave him the city which he asked, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim. And he built the city and lived in it.

51. These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they finished dividing the country.  

## Joshua 20

1. And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Appoint cities of refuge for you, as I have spoken to you by the hand of Moses,

3. that the manslayer who in innocence strikes anyone mortally, without knowing, may flee there. And they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

4. And he shall flee to one of those cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and shall declare his matter in the ears of the elders of that city. And they shall take him into the city to themselves, and shall give him a place, and he shall live with them.

5. And if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, for he has struck his neighbor without knowing, and did not hate him yesterday and the day before.

6. And he shall live in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest who is in those days. Then the manslayer shall return and come to his city, and to his house, to the city from where he fled.   

7. And they set apart Kadesh in Galilee, in the hills of Naphtali; and Shechem in the hills of Ephraim; and Kirjath-arba; (it is Hebron) in the hills of Judah.

8. And beyond the Jordan, at Jericho eastward, they gave Bezer in the wilderness, on the tableland out of the tribe of Reuben; and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

9. These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel, and for the alien who was living in their midst, that he who had struck anyone mortally without knowing might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.  

## Joshua 21

1. And the heads of the fathers of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

2. And they spoke to them in Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses to give cities to us to live in, and their open land for our livestock.

3. And the sons of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance these cities and their open land, at the mouth of Jehovah:

4. And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

5. And the rest of the sons of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

10. which the sons of Aaron had, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the sons of Levi. For theirs was the first lot.

11. And they gave them the City of Arba, the father of Anak (which is Hebron) in the hills of Judah, with its open lands around it.

12. But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his own.

13. So they gave Hebron and its open lands to the sons of Aaron the priest as a city of refuge for the slayer, and Libnah and its open lands,

14. and Jattir and its open lands, and Eshtemoa and its open lands,

15. and Holon and its open lands, and Debir and its open lands,

18. Anathoth and its open lands, and Almon and its open lands; four cities.

19. And all the cities of the sons of Aaron the priest were thirteen cities and their open land.

20. And the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites who were left of the sons of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

21. And they gave them Shechem and its open land in Mount Ephraim as a city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer and its open lands,

28. And from the tribe of Issachar they gave Kishon and its open lands, and Dabareth and its open lands,

29. Jarmuth and its open lands, En-gannim and its open lands; four cities.

30. And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal and its open lands, Abdon and its open lands,

31. Helkath and its open lands, Rehob and its open lands; four cities.

39. Heshbon and its open land, Jazer and its open lands; four cities in all.

40. All the cities for the sons of Merari by their families, those left of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.

41. All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the sons of Israel were forty eight cities and their open land.

42. These cities were every one with their open land around them. So it was to all these cities.   

43. And Jehovah gave to Israel all the land which He swore to give to their fathers. And they possessed it, and lived in it.

44. And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that He swore to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood before them. Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.

45. Not did fail a word from any good word which Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.  

## Joshua 22

1. Then Joshua called for the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

2. and said to them, You have done all that which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you. And you have listened to my voice, to all that I have commanded you.

3. You have not left your brothers these many days until today, and have kept the observance of the command of Jehovah your God.

4. And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them. And now you turn and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to you beyond the Jordan.

5. Only, be very much on guard to do the commands and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and to cleave to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.

6. And Joshua blessed them and sent them away. And they went to their tents.

7. And to the half tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given possession in Bashan. And to its other half Joshua had given possession with their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. And also when Joshua had sent them away to their tents, then he blessed them.

8. And he spoke to them, saying, You are returning to your tents with great treasures, and with very much livestock, with silver, and with gold, and with bronze, and with iron, and with much clothing. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.

9. And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh turned and left the sons of Israel from Shiloh in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession in which they have possession, according to the command of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.   

10. And when they came to the regions of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, then the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, an altar of grand appearance.

11. And the sons of Israel heard it said, Behold, the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar across from the land of Canaan, in the regions of the Jordan, at the border of the sons of Israel.

12. And the sons of Israel heard, and all the company of the sons of Israel assembled at Shiloh to go up against them to war.

13. And the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead,

14. and ten rulers with him, one ruler each for the house of a father, for all the tribes of Israel, and each of them a head of the house of their fathers, for the thousands of Israel.

15. And they came to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and spoke with them, saying,

16. So says all the company of Jehovah, What is this treachery with which the God of Israel was betrayed, to turn back today from after Jehovah, in that you built for yourself an altar so that you might rebel today against Jehovah?

17.  Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not been cleansed until this day? Yea, a plague came on the company of Jehovah;

18. that you turn away today from following after Jehovah? And it shall be that today you rebel against Jehovah, and tomorrow He shall be angry with all the company of Israel.

19. And surely, if the land of your possession is unclean, you may cross over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, there where the tabernacle of Jehovah dwells, and have possession among us. But do not rebel against Jehovah, and do not rebel against us, by building for yourselves an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.

20. Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a sin in the cursed thing, and was there not wrath on all the company of Israel? And he was not the only one to die in his iniquity.   

21. And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke with the heads of the thousands of Israel,

22. Jehovah is the God of gods; Jehovah is the God of gods! He knows, and Israel shall know, if it is in rebellion, and if it is in treachery against Jehovah, you shall not save us alive today.

23.  If we built an altar for ourselves to turn away from following after Jehovah, or to sacrifice on it burnt offering and food offering, or to offer on it sacrifices of peace, may Jehovah Himself require it .

24. But surely from anxiety, for a reason, we have done this, saying, In the future your sons shall speak to our sons, saying, What is to you and to Jehovah the God of Israel?

25. For Jehovah has put a border between you and us, O sons of Reuben, and sons of Gad; it is the Jordan. You have no portion in Jehovah! And your sons will cause our sons to fail, not fearing Jehovah.

26. And we said, Let us now prepare for ourselves, to build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice,

27. but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, to do the service of Jehovah before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings; that your sons may not say to our sons in the future, You have no portion in Jehovah.

28. And we said, And it shall be, when they say this to us, and to our generations hereafter, that we shall say, See the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice, but it  is a witness between us and you.

29. Far be it from us to rebel against Jehovah, and to turn away today from following after Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt offering, for food offering, and for sacrifice, apart from the altar of Jehovah our God, which is before His tabernacle!   

30. And Phinehas the priest, and the rulers of the congregation and the heads of the thousands of Israel with him heard the words which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh had spoken. And it was good in their eyes.

31. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Manasseh, Today we have known that Jehovah is among us, because you have not betrayed this treachery against Jehovah. Now you have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.

32. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad out of the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought word back to them.

33. And the thing was good in the eyes of the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God and no more said to go up against them to war, to destroy the land which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living in.

34. And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad proclaimed regarding the altar, that it was a witness between us that Jehovah is God.  

## Joshua 23

1. And it happened many days after Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies all around, that Joshua was old, going on in days.

2. And Joshua called for all Israel, for its elders, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its officers, and said to them, I have become old, I have advanced in days;

3. and you have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God was He who was fighting for you.

4. Behold, I have caused to fall to you these nations that are left to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea, toward the setting of the sun.

5. And Jehovah your God will thrust them out from before you, and will expel them from before you, and you shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God has spoken to you.

6. And you shall be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so as not to turn aside from it to the right or to the left;

7. so as not to go in among these nations, these who are left with you; and that you do not make mention of the name of their gods, nor shall you swear, nor shall you serve them, nor shall you bow yourselves to them.

8. But you shall cling to Jehovah your God, as you have done until today.

9. And Jehovah has expelled from before you great and mighty nations. As for you no one has stood before you until today.

10. One man of you shall pursue a thousand; for Jehovah your God is He who is fighting for you, as He has spoken to you.   

11. And you shall be very watchful for yourselves to love Jehovah your God.

12. But if you at all turn away and cleave to the remnant of the nations, of those who are left to you, and intermarry with them, and go in to them, and they to you,

13. know certainly that Jehovah your God shall not continue to expel these nations from before you, and they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which Jehovah your God has given you.

14. And, behold! Today I am going in the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and with all your soul that there has not failed one thing of all the good things which Jehovah your God has spoken concerning you; all of it has come to you; there has not one thing failed of it.

15. And it shall be, as every good thing which Jehovah your God has spoken to you comes to you, so shall Jehovah bring on you every evil thing, until He destroys you from off this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you,

16. when you transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God which He commanded you, and when you have gone and served other gods, and have bowed yourselves to them, then the anger of Jehovah shall glow against you; and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you.  

## Joshua 24

1. And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for its heads, and for its judges, and for its officers. And they placed themselves before God.

2. And Joshua said to all the people, So says Jehovah the God of Israel, Your fathers have in the past lived Beyond the River (Terah the father of Abraham and father of Nahor) and they served other gods.

3. And I took your father Abraham from Beyond the River, and caused him to go through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave Isaac to him.

4. And I gave Jacob and Esau to Isaac. And I gave Mount Seir to Esau, to possess it. And Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.

5. And I sent Moses and Aaron and plagued Egypt, as I did in its midst. And afterward I brought you out.

6. And I brought your fathers out from Egypt, and you went into the sea, and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and with horsemen, into the Sea of Reeds.

7. And they cried to Jehovah, and He set thick darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them. And your eyes saw that which I have done in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness many days.

8. And I brought you into the land of the Amorite who lived beyond the Jordan. And they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land. And I destroyed them before you.

9. And Balak the son of Zipper, the king of Moab, rose up and fought against Israel, and sent and called for Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.

10. And I was not willing to listen to Balaam, and he greatly blessed you. And I delivered you out of his hand.

11. And you crossed over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the masters of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I gave them into your hand.

12. And I sent the hornet before you, and it cast them out before you, two kings of the Amorite, not by the sword nor by your how.

13. And I have given you a land for which you have not labored, and cities which you have not built, and you live in them. You are eating of vineyards and oliveyards which you did not plant.

14. Now, then, fear Jehovah, and serve Him in sincerity and truth, and turn away from the gods which your fathers served Beyond the River, and in Egypt; and you serve Jehovah.   

15. And if it seems evil in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods whom your fathers served Beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.

16. And the people replied and said, Far be it from us to forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods.

17. For Jehovah our God is He who has brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves, and who has done these great signs before our eyes, and has preserved us in all the way in which we have gone, and among all the people through whom we have passed.

18. And Jehovah has cast out all the peoples, even the Amorite inhabiting the land before us. We also will serve Jehovah, for He is our God.

19. And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve Jehovah, for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God. He will not lift up from you your transgressions or your sins.

20. When you forsake Jehovah, and shall serve strange gods, then He will turn away and do evil to you, and consume you, after He has done good to you.

21. And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah.

22. And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves, that you have chosen Jehovah for yourselves, to serve Him (for they said, We are witnesses)

23. and now turn away from the strange gods among you, and incline your heart to Jehovah the God of Israel.

24. And the people said to Joshua, We will serve Jehovah our God, and we will listen to His voice.

25. And Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and laid on them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

26. And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone and raised it up there under the oak by the sanctuary of Jehovah.

27. And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the sayings of Jehovah which He has spoken with us. And it shall be against you for a witness, that you not lie against your God.

28. And Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.   

29. And it happened after these things, the servant of Jehovah Joshua the son of Nun died, being a son of a hundred and ten.

30. And they buried him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath-serah, which is in the hills of Ephraim, on the north of the Hill of Gaash.

31. And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, and who knew all the work of Jehovah which he did to Israel.

32. And the bones of Joseph which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem, for a hundred silver pieces. And they were for an inheritance to the sons of Joseph.

33. And Eleazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the hills of Ephraim.
