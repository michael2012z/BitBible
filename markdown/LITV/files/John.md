# John

## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. He was in the beginning with God.

3. All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.

4. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men;   

5. and the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.

6. There was a man sent from God; his name was John.

7. He came for a witness, that he might witness concerning the Light, that all might believe through Him.

8. He was not that Light, but that he might witness concerning the Light.

9. He was the true Light; He enlightens every man coming into the world.

10. He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.

11. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.

12. But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to the ones believing into His name,

13. who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God.

14. And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. And we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from the Father, full of grace and of truth.   

15. John witnesses concerning Him, and has cried out, saying, This One was He of whom I said, He coming after me has been before me, for He was preceding me.

16. And out of His fullness we all received, and grace on top of grace.

17. For the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18. No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, that One reveals Him .   

19. And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites that they might ask him, Who are you?

20. And he acknowledged and did not deny; yea, he acknowledged, I am not the Christ.

21. And they asked him, What, then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.

22. Then they said to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those sending us? What do you say about yourself?

23. He said, "I am a voice crying in the wilderness:" "Make straight" "the way of the Lord," as Isaiah the prophet said. Isa. 40:3

24. And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.

25. And they asked him and said to him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?

26. John answered them, saying, I baptize in water, but One stands in your midst whom you do not know;

27. This One it is who has come after me, who has been before me, of whom I am not worthy that I should loose the thong of His sandal.

28. These things took place in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.   

29. On the morrow, John sees Jesus coming toward him and said, Behold! The Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world!

30. This is He about whom I said, After me comes a Man who has been before me, for He was preceding me.

31. And I did not know Him; but that He be revealed to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water.

32. And John witnessed, saying, I have seen the Spirit coming down as a dove out of Heaven, and He abode on Him.

33. And I did not know Him, but the One sending me to baptize in water, that One said to me, On whomever you see the Spirit coming down and abiding on Him, this is the One baptizing in the Holy Spirit.

34. And I have seen and have witnessed that this One is the Son of God.

35. Again on the morrow, John and two from his disciples stood.

36. And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!   

37. And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.

38. But having seen them following, Jesus said to them, What do you seek? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which being translated is called Teacher), where do You stay?

39. He said to them, Come and see. They went and saw where He stayed, and they remained with Him that day. And the hour was about the tenth.

40. Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two who heard from John and was following Him.

41. This one first found his own brother Simon and tells him, We have found the Messiah (which being translated is, the Christ).

42. And he led him to Jesus. And looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which translated is Peter).   

43. And on the morrow, Jesus desired to go out into Galilee. And He found Philip, and says to him, Follow me!

44. And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip finds Nathanael and said to him, We have found the One of whom Moses wrote in the Law and the Prophets, Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.

46. And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing be out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite in whom is no guile!

48. Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called, you being under the fig tree, I saw you.

49. Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.

50. Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.

51. And He says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, from now on you will see Heaven opened, and "the angels of God ascending and descending" on the Son of man. Gen. 28:12  

## John 2

1. And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.

2. And Jesus and His disciples also were invited to the marriage.

3. And being short of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.

4. Jesus said to her, What is that to Me and to you, woman? My hour has not yet come.

5. His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do.

6. And there were six stone waterpots standing, according to the purification of the Jews, each containing two or three measures.

7. Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the top.

8. And He said to them, Now draw out and carry to the master of the feast. And they carried it.

9. But when the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know from where it was (but the servants drawing the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom,

10. and he said to him, Every man first sets on the good wine, and when they have drunk freely, then the worse. You have kept the good wine until now.

11. This beginning of the miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee. And it revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.   

12. After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples. And He remained there not many days.

13. And the Passover of the Jews was near. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14. And He found those selling oxen and sheep and doves in the temple, and the money changers sitting.

15. And making a whip out of ropes, He threw all out of the temple, both the sheep, and the oxen, and the money changers, pouring out the money and overturning the tables.

16. And to the ones selling the doves, He said, Take these things from here! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.

17. And His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of Your house has consumed Me." Psa. 69:9

18. Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do you show to us, since you do these things?

19. Jesus said to them, Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.

20. Then the Jews said, This sanctuary was forty six years being built, and do you raise it up in three days?

21. But He spoke about the sanctuary of His body.

22. Then when He was raised from the dead, His disciples recalled that He said this to them. And they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus spoke.   

23. And as He was in Jerusalem, at the Passover, at the Feast, many believed into His name, seeing the miracles which He did.

24. But Jesus Himself did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all,

25. and because He had no need that anyone should witness concerning man, for He knew what was in man.  

## John 3

1. But there was a man from the Pharisees, Nicodemus his name, a ruler of the Jews.

2. This one came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come as a teacher from God. For no one is able to do these miracles which You do, except God be with Him.

3. Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, if one does not receive birth from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus said to Him, How is a man able to be born, being old? He is not able to enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born?

5. Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, if one does not receive birth out of water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.

6. That receiving birth from the flesh is flesh, and that receiving birth from the Spirit is spirit.

7. Do not wonder because I told you, You must receive birth from above.

8. The Spirit breathes where He desires, and you hear His voice; but you do not know from where He comes, and where He goes; so is everyone who has received birth from the Spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things come about?

10. Jesus answered and said to him, You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?

11. Truly, truly, I say to you, That which we know, we speak; and that which we have seen, we testify. And you do not receive our testimony.

12. If I tell you earthly things, and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

13. And no one has gone up into Heaven, except He having come down out of Heaven, the Son of Man who is in Heaven.

14. And even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,

15. that everyone believing into Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

16. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

17. For God did not send His Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.

18. The one believing into Him is not condemned; but the one not believing has already been condemned, for he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than the Light, for their works were evil.

20. For everyone practicing wickedness hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, that his works may not be exposed.

21. But the one doing the truth comes to the Light, that his works may be revealed, that they exist, having been worked in God.   

22. After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. And He continued there with them and baptized.

23. And John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, for many waters were there. And they came and were being baptized.

24. For John had not yet been thrown into the prison.

25. Then a question from John's disciples arose with the Jews about purifying.

26. And they came to John and said to him, Teacher, the one who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have witnessed, behold, this one baptizes, and all are coming to Him.

27. John answered and said, A man is able to receive nothing unless it has been given to him from Heaven.

28. You yourselves witness to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but that having been sent, I am going before that One.

29. The one having the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. Then this my joy has been fulfilled.

30. That One must increase, but I must decrease.

31. The One coming from above is above all. The one being of the earth is earthy, and speaks of the earth. The One coming out of Heaven is above all.

32. And what He has seen and heard, this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.

33. The one receiving His testimony has sealed that God is true.

34. For the One whom God sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.

35. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.

36. The one believing into the Son has everlasting life; but the one disobeying the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  

## John 4

1. Then when the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus made more disciples and baptized more than John

2. (though truly Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),

3. He left Judea and went away into Galilee again.   

4. And it was needful for Him to pass through Samaria.

5. And He came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the piece of land Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. And Jacob's fountain was there. Then being wearied by the journey, Jesus sat thus on the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.

7. A woman came out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me some to drink.

8. For His disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions.

9. Then the Samaritan woman said to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask to drink from me, I being a Samaritan woman? For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.

10. Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who is the One saying to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked Him, and He would give you living water.

11. The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have living water?

12. Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well, and he and his sons and his livestock drank out of it?

13. Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone drinking of this water will thirst again;

14. but whoever may drink of the water which I will give him will never ever thirst, but the water which I will give to him will become a fountain of water in him, springing up into everlasting life.

15. The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.

16. Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.

17. And the woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Well did you say, I have no husband.

18. For you have had five husbands, and now he whom you have is not your husband. You have spoken this truly.

19. The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.

21. Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me that an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

22. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.

23. But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeks such ones that worship Him.

24. God is a spirit, and the ones worshiping Him must worship in spirit and truth.

25. The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, the One called Christ. When that One comes, He will announce to us all things.

26. Jesus said to her, I AM, the One speaking to you.   

27. And on this, His disciples came and marveled that He was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, What do you seek? Or, Why do You speak with her?

28. Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city and said to the men,

29. Come, see a Man who told me all things, whatever I did. Is this One not the Christ?

30. Therefore, they went out of the city and came to Him.

31. But in the meantime the disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, eat?

32. But He said to them, I have food to eat which you do not know.

33. Then the disciples said to one another, No one brought Him food to eat?

34. Jesus said to them, My food is that I should do the will of Him who sent Me, and that I may finish His work.

35. Do you do not say, It is yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest.

36. And the one reaping receives reward, and gathers fruit to everlasting life, so that both the one sowing and the one reaping may rejoice together.

37. For in this the word is true, that another is the one sowing, and another the one reaping.

38. I sent you to reap what you have not labored over. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.

39. And many of the Samaritans out of that city believed into Him, because of the word of the woman testifying, He told me all things, whatever I did.

40. Then as the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them. And He remained there two days.

41. And many more believed through His word.

42. And they said to the woman, We no longer believe because of your saying; for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this One is truly the Savior of the world, the Christ.   

43. But after the two days, He went out from there, and went away into Galilee.

44. For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own native place.

45. Therefore, when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, seeing all things which He did in Jerusalem at the Feast. For they also went to the Feast.

46. Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum.

47. Hearing that Jesus was coming from Judea into Galilee, this one went out to Him and asked Him that He would come and heal his son, for he was about to die.

48. Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not at all believe.

49. The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies.

50. Jesus said to him, Go! Your son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went away.

51. But already, as he was going down, his slaves met him and reported, saying, Your child lives.

52. He then asked from them the hour in which he had gotten better. And they said to him, Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.

53. Then the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and his whole household, believed.

54. Again, this second miracle Jesus did, coming from Judea into Galilee.  

## John 5

1. After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. And at Jerusalem is a pool at the Sheep Gate which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.

3. In these was a great multitude of the infirm lying, blind ones, lame ones, withered ones, awaiting the stirring of the water.

4. For an angel from time to time descended in the pool and agitated the water. Then the one first entering after the agitation of the water became well, whatever disease he was held by.

5. But a certain man was there, being in infirmity thirty eight years.

6. Seeing him lying, and knowing that he had already spent much time, Jesus said to him, Do you desire to become well?

7. The infirm one answered Him, Lord, I do not have a man, that when the water is agitated he may throw me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.

8. Jesus said to him, Rise up, Take up your cot and walk!

9. And instantly the man became well, and took up his cot and walked. And it was a sabbath that day.

10. Then the Jews said to the one having been healed, It is a sabbath. It is not lawful for you to lift up the cot.

11. He answered them, The One making me well, that One said to me, Lift up your cot and walk.

12. Then they asked him, Who is the man who told you, Lift up your cot and walk?

13. But he did not know the One who cured him, for a crowd being in that place, Jesus had withdrawn.

14. After these things, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well, sin no more that a worse thing not happen to you.

15. The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus is the One making him well.

16. And because of this, the Jews persecuted Jesus and lusted to kill Him, because He did these things on a sabbath.   

17. But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.

18. Because of this, therefore, the Jews lusted the more to kill Him, for not only did He break the sabbath, but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal to God.

19. Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, except what He may see the Father doing; for whatever that One does, these things also the Son does the same way.

20. For the Father loves the Son and shows to Him all things which He does. And He will show Him greater works than these in order that you may marvel.

21. For even as the Father raises the dead, and gives life, so also the Son gives life to whomever He wills.

22. For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,

23. so that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. The one not honoring the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes the One who has sent Me, has everlasting life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.

25. Truly, truly, I say to you that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones hearing will live.

26. For even as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave also to the Son to have life in Himself.

27. And He also gave authority to Him to execute judgment, for He is the Son of man.

28. Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear His voice.

29. And they will come out, the ones having done good into a resurrection of life; and the ones having practiced evil into a resurrection of judgment.

30. I am able to do nothing from Myself; just as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, for I do not seek My will, but the will of the One sending Me, the Father.   

31. If I witness concerning Myself, My witness is not true;

32. it is Another that witnesses concerning Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses concerning Me is true.

33. You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.

34. But I do not receive witness from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.

35. That one was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to exult in his light for an hour.

36. But I have the greater witness than John's, for the works which the Father has given Me, that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness concerning Me, that the Father has sent Me.

37. And the Father, He sending Me, has Himself borne witness concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form.

38. And you do not have His word abiding in you, for the One whom that One sent, this One you do not believe.

39. You search the Scriptures, for you think in them you have everlasting life. And they are the ones witnessing concerning Me.

40. And you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.

41. I do not receive glory from men;

42. but I have known you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.

43. I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive that one.

44. How are you able to believe, you who receive glory from one another, and the glory which is from the only God you do not seek?

45. Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one accusing you, Moses, in whom you have hoped.

46. For if you were believing Moses, you would then believe Me; for that one wrote concerning Me.

47. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?  

## John 6

1. After these things, Jesus went away over the Sea of Galilee, the Tiberian Sea .

2. And a great crowd followed Him, for they saw His miracles which He did on the sick ones.

3. And Jesus went up into the mountain and sat there with His disciples.

4. And the Passover was near, the feast of the Jews.

5. Then Jesus lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to Him, He said to Philip, From where may we buy loaves that these may eat?

6. But He said this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.

7. Philip answered Him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not enough for them, that each of them may receive a little.

8. One of His disciples said to Him, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter,

9. A little boy is here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?

10. And Jesus said, Make the men to recline. And much grass was in the place. Then the men reclined, the number was about five thousand.

11. And Jesus took the loaves, and giving thanks distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those reclining. And in the same way the fish, as much as they desired.

12. And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments left over, that not anything be lost.

13. Then they gathered and filled twelve hand baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over to those who had eaten.

14. Then seeing what miracle Jesus did, the men said, This is truly the Prophet, the one coming into the world.   

15. Then knowing that they were about to come and seize Him, that they might make Him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain alone by Himself.

16. And when it became evening, His disciples went down on the sea.

17. And entering into the boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had already occurred, and Jesus had not come to them.

18. And the sea was aroused by a great wind blowing.

19. Then having rowed about twenty five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea. And He having come near the boat, they were afraid.

20. But He said to them, I AM! Do not fear.

21. Then they desired to take Him into the boat. And the boat was instantly at the land to which they were going.   

22. On the morrow, the crowd standing on the other side of the sea had seen that no other little boat was there except one, that one into which His disciples entered, and that Jesus did not go with His disciples into the small boat, but that the disciples went away alone.

23. But other small boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the loaves, the Lord having given thanks.

24. Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor His disciples, they themselves also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

25. And finding Him across the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did you come here?

26. Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw miracles, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied.

27. Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you; for God the Father sealed this One.   

28. Then they said to Him, What may we do that we may work the works of God?

29. Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom that One sent.

30. Then they said to Him, Then what miracle do you do that we may see and may believe you? What do you work?

31. Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written "He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat." LXX-Psa. 77:24; MT-Psa. 78:24

32. Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of Heaven.

33. For the bread of God is He coming down out of Heaven and giving life to the world.

34. Then they said to Him, Lord, always give us this bread.

35. Jesus said to them, I am the Bread of life; the one coming to Me will not at all hunger, and the one believing into Me will never ever thirst.

36. But I said to you that you also have seen Me and did not believe.

37. All that the Father gives to Me shall come to Me, and the one coming to Me I will in no way cast out.

38. For I have come down out of Heaven, not that I should do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.

39. And this is the will of the Father sending Me, that of all that He has given Me, I shall not lose any of it, but shall raise it up in the last day.

40. And this is the will of the One sending Me, that everyone seeing the Son and believing into Him should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.

41. Then the Jews murmured about Him, because He said, I am the Bread coming down out of Heaven.

42. And they said, Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, of whom we know the father and the mother? How does this one now say, I have come down out of Heaven?

43. Then Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur with one another.

44. No one is able to come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.

45. It has been written in the Prophets, They "shall" all "be taught of God." So then everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me; Isa. 54:13

46. not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One being from God, He has seen the Father.

47. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one believing into Me has everlasting life.

48. I am the Bread of life.

49. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died.

50. This is the Bread coming down out of Heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.

51. I am the Living Bread that came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever. And indeed the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

52. Then the Jews argued with one another, saying, How can this one give us his flesh to eat?

53. Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.

54. The one partaking of My flesh and drinking of My blood has everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

55. For My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink.

56. The one partaking of My flesh and drinking of My blood abides in Me, and I in him.

57. Even as the living Father sent Me, and I live through the Father; also the one partaking Me, even that one will live through Me.

58. This is the Bread which came down out of Heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died; the one partaking of this Bread will live forever.

59. He said these things teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum.   

60. Then many of His disciples having heard, they said, This word is hard; who is able to hear it?

61. But knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, Jesus said to them, Does this offend you?

62. Then what if you see the Son of man going up where He was at first?

63. It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh does not profit, nothing! The words which I speak to you are spirit and are life.

64. But there are some of you who are not believing. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were not believing, and who was the one betraying Him.

65. And He said, Because of this, I have told you that no one is able to come to Me except it is given to him from My Father.

66. From this time many of His disciples went away into the things behind, and no longer walked with Him.

67. Therefore, Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you also wish to go?

68. Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life.

69. And we have believed and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

70. Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!

71. But He spoke of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, for this one was about to betray Him, being one of the Twelve.  

## John 7

1. And after these things Jesus was walking in Galilee; for He did not desire to walk in Judea, because the Jews were lusting to kill Him.

2. And the Jewish Feast of the Tabernacles was near.

3. Then His brothers said to Him, Move away from here and go to Judea, that your disciples will also see your works which you do,

4. for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be in public. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.

5. For His brothers did not believe into Him.

6. Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet here, but your time is always ready.

7. The world cannot hate you; but it hates Me because I witness about it, that its works are evil.

8. You go up to this feast. I am not yet going up to the feast, for My time has not yet been fulfilled.

9. And saying these things to them, He remained in Galilee.

10. But when His brothers went up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.

11. Then the Jews sought Him in the feast, and said, Where is He?

12. And much murmuring about Him was in the crowds. Some said, He is a good one; but others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.

13. However, no one publicly spoke about Him, because of the fear of the Jews.   

14. But the feast now being half over, Jesus went up to the temple and taught.

15. And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this one know letters, not being taught?

16. Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but of the One who sent Me.

17. If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.

18. The one speaking from himself seeks his own glory. But the one seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.

19. Has not Moses given you the Law, and not one of you does the Law? Why do you lust to kill Me?

20. The crowd answered and said, You have a demon. Who lusts to kill you?

21. Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.

22. Because of this Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on a sabbath, you circumcise a man.

23. If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath, that the Law of Moses is not broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man entirely sound on a sabbath?

24. Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.

25. Then some of the Jerusalemites said, Is this not the one they are seeking to kill?

26. And, behold, He speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly knew that this is indeed the Christ?

27. But we know this one, from where he is. But when the Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.

28. Then teaching, Jesus cried out in the temple, even saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I am. And I have not come from Myself, but He sending Me is true, whom you do not know.

29. But I know Him, because I am from Him; and He sent Me.

30. Then they sought to seize Him; yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.

31. But many of the crowd believed into Him, and said, The Christ, when He comes will He do more miracles than these which this One did?

32. The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers, that they might seize Him.

33. Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to Him who sent Me.

34. You will seek Me, and will not find Me ; and where I am, you are not able to come.

35. Then the Jews said amongst themselves, Where is this one about to go that we will not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?

36. What is this word which he said, You will seek Me and will not find Me , and, Where I am, you are not able to come?   

37. And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.

38. The one believing into Me, as the Scripture said, Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. No OT passage

39. But He said this concerning the Spirit, whom the ones believing into Him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet glorified.

40. Then hearing the word, many of the crowd said, This is truly the Prophet.

41. Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, No! For does the Christ come out of Galilee?

42. Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? Mic. 5:2

43. Therefore, a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.

44. And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.   

45. Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why did you not bring him?

46. The officers answered, Never did a man so speak as does this man.

47. Then the Pharisees answered them, Have you not also been deceived?

48. Not any from the rulers or from the Pharisees believed into him?

49. But not knowing the Law, this crowd is cursed.

50. Nicodemus said to them, the one coming by night to Him, being one of themselves,

51. Does our Law judge the Man unless it hear from him first, and know what he does?

52. They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that a prophet has not been raised out of Galilee.

53. And they each one went to his house.  

## John 8

1. But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

2. And at dawn, He again arrived into the temple; and all the people came to Him. And sitting down, He taught them.

3. And the scribes and the Pharisees brought to Him a woman having been taken in adultery. And standing her in the middle,

4. they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was taken in the very act, committing adultery.

5. And in the Law, Moses commanded that such should be stoned. You, then, what do you say?

6. But they said this, tempting Him, that they may have reason to accuse Him. But bending down, Jesus wrote with the finger in the earth, not appearing to hear .

7. But as they continued questioning Him, bending back up, He said to them, The one among you without sin, let him cast the first stone at her.

8. And bending down again, He wrote in the earth.

9. But hearing, and being convicted by the conscience, they went out one by one, beginning from the older ones, until the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.

10. And Jesus bending back up, and having seen no one but the woman, He said to her, Woman, where are those who accused you? Did not one give judgment against you?

11. And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I give judgment. Go, and sin no more.   

12. Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, I am the Light of the world. The one following Me will in no way walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.

13. Then the Pharisees said to Him, You witnessed concerning yourself; your witness is not true.

14. Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I witness concerning Myself, My witness is true; for I know from where I came, and where I go. But you do not know from where I came, and where I go.

15. You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.

16. But even if I judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.

17. And in your Law it has been written that the witness of two men is true. Deut. 19:15

18. I am the one witnessing concerning Myself, and He who sent Me, the Father, witnesses concerning Me.

19. Then they said to Him, Where is your father? Jesus answered, You neither know Me, nor My Father. If you had known Me, then you also would have known My Father.

20. Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, for His hour had not yet come.   

21. Then Jesus said to them again, I go, and you will seek Me. And you will die in your sin. Where I go, you are not able to come.

22. Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I go, you are not able to come?

23. And He said to them, You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.

24. Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.

25. Then they said to Him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Altogether what I also say to you.

26. I have many things to say and to judge concerning you; but the One sending Me is true, and what I heard from Him, these things I say to the world.

27. They did not know that He spoke to them of the Father.

28. Then Jesus said to them, When you lift up the Son of man, then you will know that I AM; and from Myself I do nothing; but as My Father taught Me, these things I speak.

29. And the One who sent Me is with Me. The Father did not leave Me alone, for I do the things pleasing to Him always.

30.  As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.   

31. Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in Him, If you continue in My Word, you are truly My disciples.

32. And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

33. They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed, and we have been in slavery to no one, never! How do you say, You will become free?

34. Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone practicing sin is a slave of sin.

35. But the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.

36. Therefore, if the Son sets you free, you are free indeed.

37. I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me, because My Word has no place in you.   

38. I speak what I have seen with My Father. And you therefore do what you have seen with your father.

39. They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.

40. But now you seek to kill Me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I heard alongside of God. Abraham did not do this.

41. You do the works of your father. They said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one father, God.

42. Then Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I went forth and have come from God. For I have not come from Myself, but that One sent Me.

43. Why do you not know My speech? It is because you are not able to hear My Word.

44. You are of the Devil as father, and the lusts of your father you desire to do. That one was a murderer from the beginning, and he has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, because he is a liar, and the father of it.

45. And because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.   

46. Who of you reproves Me concerning sin? But if I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?

47. The one who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear, because you are not of God.

48. Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?

49. Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.

50. But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges.   

51. Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My Word, he will never ever see death.

52. Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets, and you say, If anyone keeps My Word, he will never ever taste of death.

53. Are you greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died! Whom do you make yourself?

54. Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, whom you say is your God.

55. And you have not known Him; but I know Him, And if I say that I do not know Him, I shall be like you, a liar. But I know Him, and I keep His Word.

56. Your father Abraham leaped for joy that he should see My day, and he saw, and rejoiced.

57. Then the Jews said to Him, You do not yet have fifty years, and have you seen Abraham?

58. Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I AM.

59. Because of this, they took up stones that they might throw them on Him. But Jesus was hidden, and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.  

## John 9

1. And passing by, He saw a man blind from birth.

2. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Teacher, who sinned, this one, or his parents, that he was born blind?

3. Jesus answered, Neither this one nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.

4. It is necessary for Me to work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day. Night comes when no one is able to work.

5. While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.

6. Saying these things, He spat on the ground and made clay out of the spittle, and anointed clay on the blind one's eyes.

7. And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which translated is Sent. Then he went and washed, and came seeing.   

8. Then the neighbors and those who formerly saw him, that he was blind, said, Is this one not the one who had sat and begged?

9. Some said, It is he; and others, He is like him. That one said, I am the one .

10. Then they said to him, How were your eyes opened?

11. He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and told me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And going and washing I received sight.

12. Then they said to him, Where is that one? He said, I do not know.   

13. They brought him to the Pharisees, the one once blind.

14. And it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

15. Then also the Pharisees again asked him how he received sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.

16. Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a man, a sinner, do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

17. They said to the blind one again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.

18. Then the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and received sight, until they called the parents of him having received sight.

19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom you say that he was born blind? Then how does he now see?

20. His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.

21. But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age, ask him. He will speak about himself.

22. His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Him as Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.

23. Because of this, his parents said, He is of age, ask him.

24. Then a second time they called the man who was blind, and they said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.

25. Then he answered and said, Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know; that being blind, now I see.

26. And they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?

27. He answered them, I told you already, and you did not hear. Why do you wish to hear again? Do you also desire to become disciples of Him?

28. Then they reviled him and said, You are a disciple of that one, but we are disciples of Moses.

29. We know that God has spoken by Moses, but this one, we do not know from where he is.

30. The man answered and said to them, For there is a marvel in this, that you do not know from where He is, and He opened my eyes.

31. But we know that God does not hear sinful ones, but if anyone is God fearing, and does His will, He hears that one.

32. From the beginning of the age it was never heard that anyone opened the eyes of one having been born blind.

33. If this One was not from God, He could not do anything.

34. They answered and said to him, You were born wholly in sins, and do you teach us? And they threw him outside.   

35. Jesus heard that they threw him outside, and finding him, He said to him, Do you believe into the Son of God?

36. And he answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?

37. And Jesus said to him, Even you have seen Him, and He speaking with you is that One.

38. And he said, I believe, Lord! And he worshiped Him.   

39. And Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment, that the ones who do not see may see, and they who see may become blind.

40. And those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things, and said to Him, Are we also blind?

41. Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, We see; therefore, your sin remains.  

## John 10

1. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one not entering through the door into the sheepfold, but going up by another way, that one is a thief and a robber.

2. But the one entering through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. The doorkeeper opens to him, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.

4. And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes in front of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.

5. But they never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of the strangers.

6. Jesus spoke this allegory to them, but they did not know what it was which He spoke to them.

7. Then Jesus again said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.

8. All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.

9. I am the door. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in, and will go out, and will find pasture.

10. The thief does not come except that he may steal, and kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.

11. I am the Good Shepherd! The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.

12. But the hireling, not even being a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and forsakes the sheep and flees. And the wolf seizes them, and scatters the sheep.

13. But the hireling flees because he is a hireling, and there is not a care to him concerning the sheep.

14. I am the Good Shepherd, and I know those that are Mine, and I am known by the ones that are Mine.

15. Even as the Father knows Me, I also know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.

16. And I have other sheep which are not of this fold. I must also lead those, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock, one Shepherd.

17. For this reason My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life, that I may take it again.

18. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down from Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I received this commandment from My Father.   

19. Then a division occurred again among the Jews, because of these words.

20. And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you hear him?

21. Others said, These are not words of one having been possessed by a demon. A demon is not able to open the eyes of blind ones.   

22. And the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem, and it was winter.

23. And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's Porch.

24. Then the Jews encircled Him, and said to Him, How long do you lift up our soul? If you are the Christ, tell us publicly.

25. Jesus answered them, I told you, and you did not believe. The works which I do in the name of My Father, these bear witness about Me.

26. But you do not believe for you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.

27. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.

28. And I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish to the age, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand.

29. My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck out of My Father's hand.

30. I and the Father are one!

31. Then again the Jews took up stones, that they might stone Him.

32. Jesus answered them, I showed you many good works from My Father. For which work of them do you stone Me?

33. The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not stone you concerning a good work, but concerning blasphemy; and because you, being a man, make yourself God.

34. Jesus answered them, Has it not been written in your Law, "I said, you are gods"? Psa. 82:6

35. If He called those gods with whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture cannot be broken,

36. do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am Son of God?

37. If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.

38. But if I do, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may perceive and may believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.   

39. Then again they sought to seize Him. And He went forth out of their hand.

40. And He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was at first baptizing and remained there.

41. And many came to Him and said, John indeed did no miracle, but all things that John said concerning this One were true.

42. And many believed into Him there.  

## John 11

1. And there was a certain sick one, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

2. And it was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3. Then the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, the one whom You love is sick.

4. And hearing, Jesus said, This is not sickness to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God be glorified by it.

5. And Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

6. Therefore, when He heard that he is sick, then, indeed, He remained in the place where He was two days.

7. Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again.

8. The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, just now the Jews were seeking to stone You, and do You go there again?

9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.

10. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him.

11. He said these things. And after this, He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going that I may awaken him.

12. Then His disciples said, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.

13. But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He spoke of the sleep of slumber.

14. Therefore, then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.

15. And I rejoice because of you, in order that you may believe that I was not there. But let us go to him.

16. Then Thomas, he having been called Twin, said to the fellow disciples, Let us go, even we, that we may die with Him.   

17. Then coming, Jesus found him already being held in the tomb four days.

18. And Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off.

19. And many of the Jews had come to those around Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother.

20. Then when Martha heard that Jesus is coming, she met Him; but Mary was sitting in the house.

21. Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You were here, my brother would not be dead.

22. But even now I know that whatever You may ask God, God will give You.

23. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.

24. Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.

25. Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life. The one believing into Me, though he die, he shall live.

26. And everyone living and believing into Me shall not ever die forever. Do you believe this?

27. She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.

28. And saying these things, she went away and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and calls you.

29. That one, when she heard, rose up quickly and came to Him.

30. And Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met Him.

31. Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, seeing that Mary quickly rose up and went out, they followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb so that she may weep there.

32. Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing Him, she fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died.   

33. Then when He saw her weeping, and the Jews who came down with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.

34. And He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. Then the Jews said, See how He loved him!

37. But some of them said, Was this One, the one opening the eyes of the blind, not able to have caused that this one should not die?

38. Then groaning again within Himself, Jesus came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it.

39. Jesus said, Lift the stone. Martha, the sister of the one that had died, said to Him, Lord, he already smells, for it is the fourth day .

40. Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you will see the glory of God?

41. Then they lifted the stone where the dead one was laid. And Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, Father, I thank You that You heard Me.

42. And I know that you always hear Me, but because of the crowd standing around, I said it , that they might believe that You sent Me.

43. And saying these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus! Here! Outside!

44. And the one who had died came out, the feet and the hands having been bound with sheets, and his face being bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Loosen him and let him go.   

45. Then many of the Jews, those coming to Mary, and having seen what Jesus did, believed into Him.

46. But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

47. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a sanhedrin, and said, What are we doing, for this man does many miracles?

48. If we let him alone this way, all will believe into him, and the Romans will come and will take away from us both the place and the nation.

49. But a certain one of them, Caiaphas being high priest of that year, said to them, You know nothing,

50. nor consider that it is profitable for us that one man die for the people, and not all the nation to perish.

51. But he did not say this from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die on behalf of the nation,

52. and not only on behalf of the nation, but that He also might gather into one the children of God who had been scattered.

53. Then from that day, they took counsel that they might kill Him.

54. Then Jesus no longer walked publicly among the Jews, but went away from there into the country near a deserted place , to a city being called Ephraim, and stayed there with His disciples.

55. And the Passover of the Jews was near. And many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, that they might purify themselves.

56. Then they sought Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What does it seem to you? That He does not at all come to the Feast?

57. And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands that if anyone knew where He is, he should inform so that they might seize Him.  

## John 12

1. Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had died, whom He raised from the dead.

2. Then they made Him a supper there, and Martha served. But Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.

3. Then taking a pound of ointment of pure, costly spikenard, Mary anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped off His feet with her hairs. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.

4. Then Simon's son , one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Him, said,

5. Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?

6. But he said this, not that he was caring for the poor, but that he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried away the things being put in .

7. Then Jesus said, Allow her, for she has kept it for the day of My burial.

8. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.

9. Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come because of Jesus alone, but that they also might see Lazarus whom He raised from the dead.

10. But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus to death also,

11. because through him many of the Jews went away and believed into Jesus.   

12. On the morrow, coming to the Feast, hearing that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd

13. took palm branches and went out to a meeting with Him, and they were crying out, Hosanna! "Blessed is He coming in the name of the Lord," the King of Israel! Psa. 118:26

14. And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it, even as it had been written,

15. "Do not fear," "daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes" "sitting on" "the foal of an ass." Isa. 40:9; Zech. 9:9

16. But His disciples did not know these things at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they recalled that these things had been written on Him, and that they did these things to Him.

17. Then the crowd which was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, witnessed.

18. Because of this also the crowd met Him, because it heard of this miracle He had done.

19. Then the Pharisees said to themselves, Observe that you gain nothing. Behold, the world has gone after Him.   

20. And there were some Greeks among those coming up, that they might worship at the Feast.

21. Then these came to Philip, the one from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.

22. Philip came and told Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

23. But Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat that falls into the earth dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.

25. The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to everlasting life.

26. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will also be. And if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.   

27. And My soul is troubled, and what may I say? Father, save Me out of this hour? But on this account I came to this hour.

28. Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came out of the heaven: I both glorified it , and I will glorify it again.

29. Then standing and hearing, the crowd said that thunder occurred. Others said, An angel has spoken to Him.

30. Jesus answered and said, This voice has not occurred because of Me, but because of you.

31. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.

32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.

33. But He said this, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.

34. The crowd answered Him, We heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever. And how do you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?

35. Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness not overtake you. And the one walking in the darkness does not know where he is going.

36. While you have the Light, believe into the Light, that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things, and going away He was hidden from them.   

37. But though He had done so many miracles before them, they did not believe into Him,

38. so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said, "Lord, who has believed our report? And the arm of the Lord, to whom was it revealed?" Isa. 53:1

39. Because of this they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,

40. "He has blinded their eyes" and "has hardened their heart," "that they might not see with the eyes" and "understand with the heart," "and be converted," "and I should heal them." Isa. 6:10

41. Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory, and spoke about Him.   

42. Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe into Him. But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing, so that they not be put out of the synagogue.

43. For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.   

44. But Jesus cried out and said, The one believing into Me does not believe into Me, but into the One sending Me.

45. And the one seeing Me sees the One who sent Me.

46. I have come as a Light to the world, that everyone who believes into Me may not remain in the darkness.

47. And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.

48. The one who rejects Me and does not receive My words has that judging him: the Word which I spoke, that will judge him in the last Day.

49. For I did not speak from Myself, but He who sent Me, the Father, He has given Me command, what I should say, and what I should speak.

50. And I know that His command is everlasting life. Then what things I speak, as the Father has said to Me, so I speak.  

## John 13

1. And before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He should move from this world to the Father, loving His own in the world, He loved them to the end.

2. And supper having occurred, the Devil having put already into the heart of Simon's son Judas Iscariot that he should betray Him,

3. Jesus knowing that the Father has given all things into His hands, and that He came out from God, and goes away to God,

4. He rose up from the supper and laid aside His garments. And taking a towel, He girded Himself.

5. Then He put water into the basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe off with the towel with which He was girded.

6. He then came to Simon Peter. And that one said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing, you do not yet know. But you will know after these things.

8. Peter said to Him, You may in no way wash my feet to the age. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.

9. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also the hands and the head.

10. Jesus said to him, The one having been bathed has no need other than to wash the feet, but is wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all.

11. For He knew the one betraying Him. For this reason He said, You are not all clean.

12. Then when He had washed their feet and had taken His garments, reclining again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?

13. You call Me the Teacher, and, the Lord. And you say well, for I AM.

14. If then I washed your feet, the Lord and the Teacher, you also ought to wash the feet of one another.

15. For I gave you an example, that as I did to you, you also should do.

16. Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his lord, nor a messenger greater than the one sending him.

17. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.   

18. I do not speak concerning all of you; I know whom I chose out; but that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "The one eating the bread with Me lifted up his heel against Me." Psa. 41:9

19. From this time I tell you before it happens, that when it happens you may believe that I AM.

20. Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who receives whomever I may send receives Me; and the one who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.

21. Saying these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said, Indeed I tell you truly that one of you will betray Me.

22. Then the disciples looked upon one another, doubting of whom He spoke.

23. But there was one of His disciples reclining at the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus loved.

24. Then Simon Peter signaled to him to ask whom it might be of whom He spoke.

25. And leaning on the breast of Jesus, he said to Him, Lord, who is it?

26. Jesus answered, It is he to whom I, having dipped the morsel, shall give it . And dipping the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.

27. And after the morsel, then Satan entered into that one. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.

28. But no one of those reclining knew this, for what He spoke to him;

29. for some thought, since Judas held the moneybag, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.

30. Then, receiving the morsel, he immediately went out. And it was night.   

31. Then when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of man was glorified, and God was glorified in Him.

32. If God was glorified in Him, God also will glorify Him in Himself, and immediately will glorify Him.

33. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek Me; and, as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you are not able to come; I also say to you now.

34. I give a new commandment to you, that you should love one another; according as I loved you, you should also love one another.

35. By this all shall know that you are My disciples, if you have love among one another.   

36. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where do You go? Jesus answered him, Where I go you are not able to follow Me now, but afterwards you shall follow Me.

37. Peter said to Him, Lord, why am I not able to follow You now? I will lay down my life for You!

38. Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for Me? Indeed, I tell you truly, in no way shall a cock crow until you deny Me three times.  

## John 14

1. Do not let your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.

2. In My Father's house are many dwelling places. But if it were not so , I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you!

3. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you may be also.   

4. And where I go you know, and the way you know.

5. Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You go, and how can we know the way?

6. Jesus said to him, I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.

7. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you do know Him, and have seen Him.

8. And Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.

9. Jesus said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? The one seeing Me has seen the Father! And how do you say, Show us the Father?

10. Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me, He does the works.

11. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe Me because of the works themselves.   

12. Indeed, I tell you truly, He that believes in Me, the works which I do, that one shall do also, and greater than these he will do, because I go to My Father.

13. And whatever you may ask in My Name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

14. If you ask anything in My Name, I will do it .   

15. If you love Me, keep My commandments.

16. And I will petition the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may remain with you forever,

17. the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive because it does not see Him nor know Him. But you know Him, for He abides with you and shall be in you.   

18. I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.

19. Yet a little while and the world no longer sees Me, but you see Me. Because I live, you also shall live.

20. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you.

21. He that has My commandments and keeps them, it is that one who loves Me; and the one that loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I shall love him and will reveal Myself to him.

22. Judas said to Him, not the Iscariot, Lord, what has happened that You are about to reveal Yourself to us and not at all to the world?

23. Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My Word, and My Father shall love him. And We will come to him and will make a dwelling place with him.

24. The one who does not love Me does not keep My words. And the Word which you hear is not Mine but of the Father who sent Me.   

25. I have spoken these things to you, abiding with you;

26. but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and shall remind you of all things that I said to you.

27. I leave peace to you; My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be timid.   

28. You heard that I said to you, I am going away, and I am coming again to you. If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced that I said, I am going to the Father; for My Father is greater than I.

29. And now I have told you before it occurs, that when it shall occur you may believe.

30. I shall no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me.

31. But that the world may know that I love the Father, even as the Father commanded Me, so I do. Rise up, let us go from here.  

## John 15

1. I am the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser.

2. Every branch in Me not bearing fruit, He takes it away; and each one bearing fruit, He prunes, so that it may bear more fruit.

3. You are already pruned because of the Word which I have spoken to you.

4. Remain in Me, and I in you. As the branch is not able to bear fruit of itself, unless it remain in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me.

5. I am the Vine; you are the branches. He that remains in Me, and I in him, this one bears much fruit. For apart from Me you are not able to do anything.

6. Unless one remains in Me, he is cast out as the branch and is dried up; and they gather and throw them into a fire, and they are burned.

7. If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, whatever you desire you will ask, and it shall happen to you.

8. In this My Father is glorified, that you should bear much fruit; and you will be My disciples.   

9. As the Father loved Me, I also loved you; continue in My love.

10. If you keep My commandments you will continue in My love, as I have kept My Father's commandments and continue in His love.

11. I have spoken these things to you that My joy may abide in you, and your joy may be full.

12. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I loved you.

13. Greater love than this has no one, that anyone should lay down his soul for his friends.

14. You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.

15. I no longer call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his lord does. But I called you friends, because all things which I heard from My Father I made known to you.

16. You have not chosen Me, but I chose you out and planted you, that you should go and should bear fruit, and your fruit remain, that whatever you should ask the Father in My name, He may give you.

17. These things I command you, that you love one another.   

18. If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it has hated you.

19. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.

20. Remember the Word which I said to you, A slave is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted Me, they also will persecute you. If they kept My Word, they also will keep yours.

21. But all these things they will do to you on account of My name, because they do not know the One who sent Me.

22. If I had not come and had not spoken to them, they had no sin. But now they do not have excuse as to their sin.

23. The one hating Me also hates My Father.

24. If I did not do the works among them which no other did, they had no sin. But now they both have seen and also have hated Me and My Father.

25. But that may be fulfilled the Word that has been written in their Law, "They hated Me without a cause." Psa. 69:4   

26. And when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, that One will witness concerning Me.

27. And you also witness, because from the beginning you are with Me.  

## John 16

1. I have spoken these things to you so that you may not be offended.

2. They will put you out of the synagogue, but an hour is coming that everyone killing you will think to bear a service before God.

3. And they will do these things to you because they do not know the Father nor Me.

4. But I have spoken these things to you so that when the hour comes you may recall them, that I told you these things. But I did not say these things to you from the beginning because I was with you.

5. But now I am going to Him who sent Me. And not one of you asks Me, Where are you going?

6. But because I have said these things to you, grief has filled your heart.   

7. But I tell you the truth, it is advantageous for you that I should go; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I go, I will send Him to you.

8. And when that One comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.

9. Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me;

10. and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you no longer see Me;

11. and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

12. I have yet many things to tell you, but you are not able to bear now.

13. But when that One comes, the Spirit of truth, He will guide you into all truth, for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will announce the coming things to you.

14. That One will glorify Me, for He will receive from Mine and will announce to you.

15. All things which the Father has are Mine. For this reason I said that He receives from Mine, and will announce to you.   

16. A little while and you do not see Me. And again a little while , and you will see Me, because I go away to the Father.

17. Then His disciples said to one another, What is this which He says to us, A little while , and you do not see me; and again, A little and you will see Me? And, Because I go away to the Father?

18. Then they said, What is this that He says, The little? We do not know what He says.

19. Then Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him. And He said to them, Do you seek answers with one another concerning this, because I said, A little while , and you do not see Me; and again a little and you will see Me?

20. Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and will lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be grieved, but your grief will become joy.

21. The woman has grief when she bears, because her hour came, but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the distress, because of the joy that a man was born into the world.

22. And you, then, truly have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy from you.   

23. And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give you.

24. Until now you asked nothing in My name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be full.

25. I have spoken these things to you in allegories. An hour comes when I will no longer speak to you in allegories, but I will reveal the Father plainly to you.

26. In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not tell you that I will petition the Father about you;

27. for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came out from God.   

28. I came out from the Father and have come into the world; I leave the world again and go to the Father.

29. His disciples said to Him, Behold, now You speak plainly and You say no allegory.

30. Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone question You. By this we believe that You came out from God.

31. Jesus answered them, Do you believe now?

32. Behold, an hour is coming, and now has come, that you are scattered, each one to his own things, and you will leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.

33. I have spoken these things to you that you may have peace in Me. You have distress in the world; but be encouraged, I have overcome the world.  

## John 17

1. Jesus spoke these things and lifted up His eyes to Heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may also glorify You,

2. as You gave to Him authority over all flesh, so that to all which You gave to Him, He may give to them everlasting life.

3. And this is everlasting life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.

4. I have glorified You on the earth. I finished the work that You gave Me to do.

5. And now Father, glorify Me with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the existence of the world.   

6. I revealed Your name to the men whom You gave to Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me; and they have kept Your Word.

7. Now they have known that all things, whatever You gave to Me, are from You.

8. For the words which You gave to Me, I have given to them. And they received and truly knew that I came out from beside You, and they believed that You sent Me.

9. I pray concerning them; I do not pray concerning the world, but for those whom You gave to Me, for they are Yours.

10. And all My things are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.   

11. And no longer I am in the world, yet these are in the world; and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, those whom You gave to Me, that they may be one as We are .

12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name; I guarded those whom You gave to Me, and not one of them was lost, except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

13. And now I come to You, and I speak these things in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in them.

14. I have given them Your Word, and the world hated them because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.

15. I do not pray that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from evil.

16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.   

17. Sanctify them in Your truth; Your Word is truth.

18. As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world,

19. and I sanctify Myself for them, that they also may be sanctified in truth.   

20. And I do not pray concerning these only, but also concerning those who will believe in Me through their word;

21. that all may be one, as You are in Me, Father, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.

22. And I have given them the glory which You have given Me, that they may be one, as We are one:

23. I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected in one; and that the world may know that You sent Me and loved them, even as You loved Me.   

24. Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me, that where I am, they may be with Me also, that they may behold My glory which You gave Me, because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.

25. Righteous Father, indeed the world did not know You, but I knew You; and these have known that You sent Me.

26. And I made known to them Your name, and will make it known, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.  

## John 18

1. Having said these things, Jesus went out with His disciples across the winter stream Kidron, where there was a garden into which He and His disciples entered.

2. And Judas, the one betraying Him, also knew the place, because Jesus many times assembled there with His disciples.

3. Then receiving a cohort and under-officers from among the chief priests and the Pharisees, Judas came there with torches and lamps and weapons.

4. Then knowing all the things coming upon Him, going forth, Jesus said to them, Whom do you seek?

5. They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas, the one betraying Him, also stood with them.

6. Then when He said to them, I AM, they departed into the rear and fell to the ground.

7. Then again He asked, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.

8. Jesus answered, I told you that I AM; then if you seek Me, allow these to depart,

9. (that the Word might be fulfilled which He said, " Of those whom You gave to Me, I lost not one of them)."

10. Then having a sword, Simon Peter drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. And the slave's name was Malchus.

11. Then Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not at all drink it?

12. Then the cohort, even the commander and the under-officers of the Jews together, seized Jesus and bound Him.   

13. And they led Him away first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest of that year.

14. And Caiaphas was the one who had given counsel to the Jews that it was advantageous for one man to perish for the people.

15. And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus, and that disciple was known to the high priest and entered together with Jesus into the court of the high priest,

16. but Peter stood at the door outside. The other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.

17. Then the slave woman, the doorkeeper, said to Peter, Are you not also of the disciples of this man? That one said, I am not.

18. Now the slaves and the under-officers were standing and warming themselves , having made a fire of coals, for it was cold; and Peter was with them, standing and warming himself .

19. Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His doctrine.

20. Jesus answered him, I publicly spoke to the world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple where the Jews always come together, and I spoke nothing in secret.

21. Why do you question Me? Question those hearing what I spoke to them: behold, these know what I said!

22. But on His having said these things, one of the under-officers standing by gave Jesus a blow with the palm, saying, Do you answer the high priest this way?

23. Jesus answered him, If I spoke evilly, bear witness concerning the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?

24. Then having bound Him , Annas sent Him forth to Caiaphas the high priest.

25. And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . Then they said to him, Are you not also of His disciples? He denied and said, I am not.

26. One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with Him?

27. Then again Peter denied, and immediately a cock crowed.   

28. Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium, and it was early. And they did not enter into the praetorium that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.

29. Then Pilate went out to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?

30. They answered and said to him, If this one were not an evildoer, then we would not have delivered him to you.

31. Then Pilate said to them, You take him and judge him according to your own Law. Then the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,

32. (that the word of Jesus which He said might be fulfilled, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die).

33. Then Pilate again went into the praetorium and called Jesus, and said to Him, Are you the king of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered him, Do you say this from yourself, or did others tell you about Me?

35. Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your nation, even the chief priests, delivered you up to me! What did you do?

36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would have fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.

37. Then Pilate said to Him, Are you really a king? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I might witness to the Truth. Everyone being of the Truth hears My voice.

38. Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And saying this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, I do not find even one crime in him!

39. But there is a common custom to you that I should release one prisoner to you at the Passover. Then you decide: should I release the king of the Jews to you?

40. Then all cried out again, saying, Not this one, but Barabbas! But Barabbas was a robber.  

## John 19

1. Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged Him .

2. And having plaited a wreath out of thorns, the soldiers put it on His head. And they threw a purple mantle around Him,

3. and said, Hail, king of the Jews! And they gave Him blows with the palm.

4. Then Pilate went outside again and said to them, Behold, I bring Him out to you that you may know that I do not find even one crime in Him!

5. Then Jesus came outside, wearing the thorny wreath and the purple mantle. And he said to them, Behold, the Man!

6. Then when the chief priests and the under-officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take him and crucify him , for I do not find one crime in him!

7. Then the Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our Law he ought to die because he made himself Son of God!

8. Then when Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid.

9. And he entered into the praetorium again and said to Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus did not give him an answer.

10. So Pilate said to Him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?

11. Jesus answered, You would have no authority against Me, not any, if it were not given to you from above. Because of this, the one delivering Me to you has a greater sin.

12. From this time , Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this one, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.

13. Then hearing this word, Pilate led Jesus out. And he sat down on the judgment seat, at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. And it was the Preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold, your king!

15. But they cried out, Away, Away! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.   

16. Therefore, then, he delivered Him up to them, that He might be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him away.

17. And He went out bearing His cross, to the place called Of a Skull (which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha),

18. where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in the middle.   

19. And Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. And having been written, it was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. Therefore, many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it had been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin.

21. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews.

22. Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.

23. Then when they crucified Jesus, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part to each soldier, also the tunic. And the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout.

24. Then they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots about it, whose it will be (that the Scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided My garments among them," and "they threw a lot for My garment." Then indeed the soldiers did these things. LXX-Psa. 21:19; MT-Psa. 22:18 )

25. And His mother, and His mother's sister Mary, the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene stood by the cross of Jesus.

26. Then seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, Jesus said to His mother, Woman, behold your son!

27. Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother! And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own home .

28. After this, knowing that all things have now been finished that the Scripture be completed, Jesus said, I thirst.

29. Then a vessel full of vinegar was set, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop around, they brought it to His mouth. Psa. 69:21

30. Then when Jesus took the vinegar, He said, It has been finished. And bowing His head, He delivered up the spirit.   

31. Then, since it was Preparation, that the bodies not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for great was the day of that sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and they be taken away.

32. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other crucified with Him.

33. But on coming to Jesus, when they saw He was dead already, they did not break His legs.

34. But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a lance, and at once blood and water came out.

35. And the one seeing has borne witness and his witness is true; and that one knows that he speaks truly, that you may believe.

36. For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of Him shall be broken." Ex. 12:46; Psa. 34:20

37. And again, a different Scripture says, "They shall look at Him whom they have pierced." Zech. 12:10   

38. And after these things, Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed because of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.

39. And Nicodemus also came, the one coming at first to Jesus by night, bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.

40. Then they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linens, with the spices, as is usual with the Jews in burying.

41. And there was a garden in the place where He was crucified, and a new tomb in the garden, in which no one yet ever had been placed.

42. There, then, because of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they put Jesus.  

## John 20

1. But on the first of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, darkness yet being on it . And she saw the stone had been removed from the tomb.

2. Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they laid Him.

3. Then Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb.

4. And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran in front more quickly than Peter and came first to the tomb.

5. And stooping down, he saw the linens lying; however, he did not go in.

6. Then Simon Peter came following him, and went into the tomb and saw the linens lying.

7. And the grave cloth which was on His head was not lying with the linens, but was wrapped up in one place by itself.

8. Therefore, then the other disciple also entered, he having come first to the tomb, even he saw and believed.

9. For they did not yet know the Scripture, that it was necessary for Him to rise from the dead.

10. Then the disciples went away again to themselves.   

11. But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb.

12. And she saw two angels in white, sitting one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

13. And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they took away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him.

14. And saying these things, she turned backward and saw Jesus standing, and did not know that it was Jesus.

15. Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Thinking that it was the gardener, she said to Him, Sir, if you carried Him away, tell me where you put Him, and I will take Him away.

16. Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning around, she said to Him, Rabboni! (that is to say, Teacher).

17. Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and say to them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and My God, and your God.

18. Mary Magdalene came bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He told her these things.   

19. Then it being evening on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors having been locked where the disciples were assembled, because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace to you.

20. And saying this, He showed them His hands and side. Then seeing the Lord, the disciples rejoiced.

21. Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.

22. And saying this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.

23. Of whomever you forgive the sins, they are forgiven to them. Or whomever you may retain, they are retained.

24. But Thomas, one of the Twelve, the one called Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. Then the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see the mark of the nails in His hands, and thrust my finger into the mark of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, in no way will I believe.   

26. And after eight days, His disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. The door having been locked, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.

27. Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and thrust into My side, and be not unbelieving, but believing.

28. And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!

29. Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, Thomas, you have believed. Blessed are the ones not seeing and believing.

30. Then truly Jesus did many other miracles in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.

31. But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.  

## John 21

1. After these things, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He revealed Himself this way:

2. Simon Peter, and Thomas, being called The Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.

3. Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We also are coming with you. They went and entered into the boat at once. And in that night, they caught nothing.

4. And it now becoming early morning, Jesus stood on the shore. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

5. Then Jesus said to them, Children, do you not have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.

6. And He said to them, Cast the net into the right side of the boat and you will find.

7. Then they cast, and they no longer had the strength to draw, from the multitude of the fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on his coat (for he was naked) and threw himself into the sea.

8. And the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of the fish.

9. Then when they went up on the land, they saw a coal fire lying, and a fish lying on it , and bread.

10. Jesus said to them, Bring from the little fish which you caught now.

11. Simon Peter went up and dragged the net onto the land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty three. And though being so many, the net was not torn.

12. Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And no one of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it is the Lord.

13. Then Jesus came and took the bread, and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.

14. This now is the three times that Jesus was revealed to His disciples, He being raised from the dead.   

15. Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs!

16. Again He says to him, secondly, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He says to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Shepherd My sheep!

17. Thirdly, He said to him, Simon son of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him a third time , Do you love Me? And he said to him, Lord, You perceive all things, You know that I love You! Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep!

18. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself, and you walked where you desired. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you, and will carry you where you do not desire.

19. But He said this signifying by what death he would glorify God. And having said this, He told him, Follow Me.   

20. But turning, Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them , who also leaned on His breast at the Supper, and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You?

21. Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what of this one?

22. Jesus said to him, If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.

23. Therefore, the word went out to the brothers that that disciple does not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you?

24. This is the disciple witnessing about these other things, writing these things, and we know that his witness is true.

25. And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which if they were written singly, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books having been written. Amen.
