# Acts

## Acts 1

1. Indeed, O Theophilus, I made the first report concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,

2. until the day He was taken up, having given directions to the apostles whom He chose, through the Holy Spirit,

3. to whom also He presented Himself living after His suffering, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them through forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.

4. And having met with them , He charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, "which you heard of Me;

5. for John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days after."   

6. Then, indeed, coming together they questioned Him, saying, Lord, do You restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?

7. And He said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons which the Father placed in His own authority;

8. but you will receive power, the Holy Spirit coming upon you, and you will be witnesses of Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.

9. And saying these things, as they looked on, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him from their eyes.

10. And as they were intently looking into the heaven, He having gone, even behold, two men in white clothing stood by them,

11. who also said, Men, Galileans, why do you stand looking up to the heaven? This Jesus, the One being taken from you into the heaven, will come in the way you saw Him going into the heaven.   

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount being called Of Olive Grove, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey away.

13. And when they went in, they went up to the upper room where they were waiting: both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas  the brother of James.

14. These all were continuing steadfastly in prayer and in supplication with one mind, with the women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.   

15. And in these days, standing up in the middle of the disciples, (and the number of names together being about a hundred and twenty), Peter said,

16. Men, brothers, it was necessary for this Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke before by David's mouth concerning Judas, the one having become guide to those seizing Jesus;

17. for he was numbered with us, and obtained a portion of this ministry.

18. Indeed, then, this one bought a field out of the reward of unrighteousness; and falling headlong, he burst in the middle, and poured out all his bowels.

19. And it became known to all those living in Jerusalem, so as that field to be called in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.

20. For it has been written in the scroll of Psalms, Let his estate become forsaken, and he not be living in it. And, "Let another take his overseership." LXX-Psa. 68:26; Psa. 108:8; MT-Psa. 69:25; Psa. 109:8

21. Therefore, it is right that one of these men being together with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,

22. beginning from the baptism of John until the day when He was taken from us, one of these to become a witness of His resurrection with us.

23. And they set out two: Joseph, he being called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And having prayed, they said, You, Lord, knower of all hearts, show which one You chose from these two,

25. to take the share of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas fell, to go to his own place.

26. And they gave their lots. And the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.  

## Acts 2

1. And in the fulfilling of the day of Pentecost, they were all with one mind in the same place.

2. And suddenly a sound came out of the heaven, as being borne along by a violent wind! And it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And tongues as of fire appeared to them, being distributed, and it sat on each one of them.

4. And they were all filled of the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave ability to them to speak.   

5. And Jews were living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation of those under the heaven.

6. But this sound occurring, the multitude came together and were confounded, because they each heard them speaking in his own dialect.

7. And all were amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, are not all these, those speaking, Galileans?

8. And how do we hear each in our own dialect in which we were born,

9. Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those living in Mesopotamia, both Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

10. both Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the regions of Libya over against Cyrene, and the temporarily residing Romans, both Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians; in our own languages we hear them speaking the great deeds of God?

12. And all were amazed and puzzled, saying to one another, What would this wish to be?

13. But ridiculing, others said, They are full of sweet wine.   

14. But standing up with the Eleven, Peter lifted up his voice and spoke out to them, Men, Jews, and all those living in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words:

15. For these are not drunk, as you imagine, for it is the third hour of the day.

16. But this is that which has been spoken by the prophet Joel,

17. "And it shall be" in the last days, God says, "I will pour from My Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy;" "and your young men shall see visions," "and your old men shall dream dreams;"

18. "and also I will pour out My Spirit on My slaves and slave women in those days," and they shall prophesy.

19. "And I will give wonders in the heaven above," and miracles "on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

20. The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the" "coming of the great and glorious" "day of the Lord."

21. "And it shall be that everyone who shall call on the name of the Lord will be saved." Joel 3:15

22. Men, Israelites, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man from God, having been approved among you by powerful deeds and wonders and miracles, which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,

23. this One given to you by the before-determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you having taken by lawless hands, having crucified Him , you put Him to death.

24.  But God raised Him up, loosing the throes of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.

25. For David said as to Him, "I always foresaw the Lord before Me, because He is at My right hand , that I not be moved.

26. For this reason My heart rejoiced, and My tongue was glad; and My flesh also will dwell on hope,

27. because You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You give Your Holy One to see corruption.

28. You revealed to Me paths of life; You will fill Me with joy with Your face." LXX-Psa. 15:8-11; MT-Psa. 16:8-11

29. Men, brothers, it is permitted to say to you with plainness as to the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us until this day.

30. Being a prophet, then, and knowing that God swore with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loin, as concerning flesh, to raise the Christ to sit on his throne, see Psa. 132:11

31. foreseeing, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, "that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption." LXX-Psa. 15:10; Mt-Psa. 16:10

32. This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.

33. Then being exalted to the right of God, and receiving the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you now see and hear.

34. For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

35. until I place Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." LXX-Psa. 109:1; MT-Psa. 110:1

36. Then assuredly, let all the house of Israel acknowledge that God made Him both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus whom you crucified.   

37. And hearing, they were stabbed in the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men, brothers, What shall we do?

38. And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, each of you on the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.

40. And with many other words he earnestly testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.

41. Then those who gladly welcomed his words were baptized. And about three thousand souls were added that day.   

42. And they were continuing steadfastly in the doctrine of the apostles, and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.

43. And fear came to every soul, and many wonders and miracles took place through the apostles.

44. And all the believers were together and had all things common.

45. And they sold possessions and goods and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.

46. And continuing steadfastly with one mind day by day in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they shared food in gladness and simplicity of heart,

47. praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church those being saved from day to day.  

## Acts 3

1. And Peter and John were going up on the same day into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth.

2. And a certain man, being lame from his mother's womb, was being carried, whom day by day they put at the door of the temple, being called Beautiful, to ask alms from those going into the temple;

3. who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked alms.

4. And with John, looking intently toward him, Peter said, Look to us!

5. And he paid heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. But Peter said, There is no silver and gold to me, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean, rise up and walk!

7. And taking him by the right hand, he raised him up. And immediately his feet and ankle-bones were made firm.

8. And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking, and praising God.

10. And they recognized him, that it was the one who was sitting for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled with amazement and ecstasy at the thing that happened to him.

11. And the healed lame one was holding to Peter and John, and all the people ran together to them on the porch called Solomon's, greatly amazed.   

12. And seeing this , Peter answered to the people, Men, Israelites, why do you marvel at this one? Or why do you stare at us, as if by our own power or godliness we have made him to walk?

13. The "God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob," "the God of our fathers," Ex. 3:15 glorified His child Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied Him in the presence of Pilate, that one having decided to set Him free.

14. But you denied the Holy and Just One , and asked for a man, a murderer, to be granted to you.

15. And the Author of Life you killed, whom God raised up from the dead, of which we are witnesses.

16. And on the faith of His name, this one whom you see and know was made firm by His name, and the faith which came through Him gave to him this complete soundness before you all.

17. And now, brothers, I know that you acted according to ignorance, as also did your rulers.

18. But what things God before announced through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ should suffer, He fulfilled in this manner.

19. Therefore, repent, and convert, for the blotting out of your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from the face of the Lord,

20. and that He may send forth the One before proclaimed to you, Jesus Christ,

21. whom Heaven truly needs to receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of all His holy prophets from the age past.

22. For Moses indeed said to the fathers, " The Lord your God will raise up to you a Prophet from among your brothers, One like me; you shall hear Him according to all things," whatever He may speak to you. See Deut. 18:15-16, 19

23. And it shall be that of every soul, whoever should not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.

24. And also all the prophets, from Samuel and those following after, as many as spoke, also before announced these days.

25. You are sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God appointed to our fathers, saying to Abraham, "Even in your Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed." Gen. 22:18

26. Having raised up His child Jesus, God sent Him first to you, blessing you in turning away each one from your iniquities.  

## Acts 4

1. And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the temple commander, and the Sadducees stood near them,

2. being distressed because they taught the people and announced in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3.  And they laid hands on them , and put them into custody until the morrow, for it was already evening.

4. But many of those hearing the Word believed; and the number of the men became about five thousand.   

5. And it happened on the morrow that the rulers and elders and scribes gathered into Jerusalem;

6. also Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the high priestly family.

7. And standing them in the midst, they were inquiring, By what sort of power, or by what sort of name did you do this?

8. Then being filled of the Holy Spirit, Peter said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,

9. if we are being examined today on a good work of an infirm man, by what this one has been healed,

10. let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this name this one stands before you whole.

11. This One is the Stone counted worthless by you the builders, which has become to be the Head of the Corner; Psa. 118:22

12. and there is salvation in no other One, for neither is there any other name under Heaven having been given among men by which we must be saved.

13. But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and having perceived that they are untaught and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they were with Jesus.

14. But seeing the man standing with them, the one having been healed, they had nothing to say against him .   

15. But commanding them to go outside the sanhedrin, they conferred with one another,

16. saying, What may we do to these men? For that a notable miracle indeed has occurred through them is plain to all those living in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it.

17. But that it may not be spread abroad further to the people, let us threaten them with a threat that they no longer speak on this name to any one of men.

18. And calling them, they ordered them not to speak at all, nor to teach on the name of Jesus.

19. But answering them Peter and John said, Whether it is right before God to listen to you rather than God, you judge.

20. For we are not able not to speak what we saw and heard.

21. But having threatened them again, they released them, finding nothing as to how they might punish them, on account of the people, because all glorified God on the thing happening.

22. For the man on whom this miracle of healing had occurred was more than forty years of age .   

23. And being let go, they came to their own and reported to them what the chief priests and elders said.

24. And hearing they with one passion lifted voice to God and said, Master, You are "the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them," Ex. 20:11

25. who through the mouth of Your servant David said, "Why did the nations rage, and the people meditated foolish things.

26. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were assembled on the same day against the Lord, yea, against His Christ." Psa. 2:1, 2

27. For truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together against Your holy child Jesus, whom You anointed,

28. to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel before-determined to be done.

29. And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings and give to Your slaves to speak Your Word with all boldness,

30. in the extending of Your hand for healing and miracles and wonders to happen through the name of Your holy child Jesus.

31. And they having prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the Word of God with boldness.   

32. And of the multitude of those who believed, the heart and the soul were one. And no one said any of the possessions to be his own, but all things were common to them.

33. And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.

34. For neither was anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them , they bore the value of the things being sold,

35. and laid them at the feet of the apostles. And it was distributed to each according as any had need.

36. And Joses, the one surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, which being translated is, Son of Consolation, a Levite, a Cypriot by race,

37. a field being his, selling it , he bore the proceeds and placed them at the feet of the apostles.  

## Acts 5

1. But a certain man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a property,

2. and kept back from the price, his wife also aware of it , and bringing a certain part, he put it at the feet of the apostles.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why did Satan fill your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to secretly keep back from the price of the land?

4. Remaining, did it not remain yours? And being sold, was it not in your authority? Why is it that this action was put into your heart? You did not lie to men, but to God!

5. And hearing these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And great fear came on all those hearing these things.

6. And rising up the younger ones wrapped him, and carrying out, they buried him .

7. And about three hours afterwards, his wife also entered, not knowing that happening.

8. And Peter answered her, Tell me if you gave over the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.

9. And Peter said to her, Why was it that it was agreed with you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those burying your husband at the door! Yea, they will carry you out.

10. And she immediately fell at his feet and expired. And entering, the younger ones found her dead, and carrying her out, they buried her beside her husband.

11. And great fear came on all the church and on all those hearing these things.   

12. And many miracles and wonders among the people took place through the hands of the apostles. And they were all with one passion in Solomon's Porch.

13. And of the rest, no one dared to be joined to them, but the people greatly magnified them.

14. And more believing ones were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and of women,

15. so as to carry out the sick in the streets, and to place them on cots and mattresses, that at the coming of Peter, if even his shadow might overshadow some of them.

16. And also the multitude came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick ones and those being tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.   

17. And rising up, the high priest and all those with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with zeal,

18. and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.

19. But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison during the night, and leading them out, he said,

20. Go! And standing in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this Life.

21. And hearing, they went into the temple about dawn and taught. But having come near, the high priest and those with him called together the sanhedrin and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel. And they sent to the jail to have them brought.

22. But having come near, the officers did not find them in the prison. And returning, they reported,

23. saying, Indeed we found the jail having been shut with all security, and the guards outside standing before the doors. But opening it, we found no one inside.

24. And when they heard these words, both the priest and the temple commander and the chief priests were in doubt concerning them, what this might be.

25. But having come, one reported to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.   

26. Then the commander going with the officers, they brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, that they might not be stoned.

27. And bringing them, they stood in the sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,

28. saying, Did we not command you by a command that you not teach in this name? And, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring on us the blood of this man.

29. But answering Peter and the apostles said, It is right to obey God rather than man.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you seized, hanging Him on a tree.

31. This One God has exalted as a Ruler and Savior to His right hand , to give to Israel repentance and remission of sins.

32. And we are His witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Spirit, whom God gave to those obeying Him.

33. But those hearing were cut, and they took counsel to do away with them.

34. But one standing up in the sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law honored by all the people, commanded the apostles to be put outside a little while.

35. And he said to them, Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do on these men.

36. For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming himself to be somebody, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred, who was done away, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed and came to nothing.

37. After this, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the Registration. And he drew considerable people after him. Yet that one perished, and all were scattered, as many as obeyed him.

38. And now I say to you, draw away from these men and permit them; because if this counsel is of men, or this work, it will be destroyed.

39. But if it is from God, you will not be able to destroy it, lest you be found even fighters against God.

40. And they obeyed him. And having called the apostles, beating them, they commanded not to speak on the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41. Then they indeed departed from the presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were deemed worthy to be dishonored on behalf of His name.

42. And every day they did not cease teaching and preaching the gospel of Jesus the Christ in the temple, and house to house.  

## Acts 6

1. But in those days, the disciples having multiplied, a murmuring of the Hellenists toward the Hebrews occurred, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving.

2. And having called near the multitude of the disciples, the Twelve said, It is not pleasing to us, having left the Word of God, to serve tables!

3. Then brothers, be looking for men among you receiving testimony, seven men full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need.

4. But we shall continue steadfast in prayer and the service of the Word!

5. And the saying was pleasing before all the multitude. And they chose out Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,

6.  each of whom they made stand before the apostles. And having prayed, they placed their hands on them.

7. And the Word of God was increasing, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was multiplying exceedingly. Even a great crowd of the priests were attending to the faith!   

8. And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing wonders and great signs among the people.

9. But some of those of the synagogue called Libertines, rose up, also some Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some of those from Cilicia and Asia Minor, disputing with Stephen.

10. And they had no strength to stand against the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.

11. Then they induced some men to be saying, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God!

12. And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes. And coming on, they together seized him and led him into the sanhedrin.

13. And they stood up false witnesses, who were saying, This man does not cease speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law;

14. for we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered over to us.

15. And having looked intently at him, all those having sat in the sanhedrin, saw his face as if it were the face of an angel.  

## Acts 7

1. And the high priest said, Tell me then if you thus hold these things?

2. And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran,

3. and said to him, "Go out from your land and from your kindred," "and come into a land which I will show to you." Gen. 12:1

4. Then going out from the land of the Chaldeans, he lived in Haran. And after his father died, God moved him from there into this land in which you now live.

5. And He did not give to him an inheritance in it, not even a foot breadth. And He promised to give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him, there being no child to him. Gen. 17:8

6. And God spoke thus, that his seed would be a temporary resident in another land, and they would enslave it and oppress it four hundred years. See Gen. 15:13

7. And God said, I will judge the nation to which you will be in bondage." And, After these things they will come out and will serve Me in this place. Gen. 15:14; Ex. 3:12

8. And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision; and so he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. And Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.

9. And being jealous of Joseph, the patriarchs sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,

10. and plucked him out from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh the king of Egypt. And Pharaoh appointed him governor over Egypt and all his household.

11. But a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. And our fathers did not find food.

12. But hearing grain was in Egypt, Jacob sent our fathers out first.

13. And at the second time , Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race became known to Pharaoh.

14. And sending, Joseph called his father Jacob and all his kindred, "seventy five" "souls" "in all ". Gen. 46:27

15. And Jacob went down into Egypt and expired, he and our fathers.

16. And they were moved into Shechem, and were put in the tomb which Abraham bought for a price of silver from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.   

17. But as the time of the promise drew near, which God swore to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,

18. until "another king rose up" "who did not know Joseph." Ex. 1:8

19. Dealing slyly with our race, this one oppressed our fathers, causing their infants to be exposed so as not to be kept alive.

20. In which time Moses was born and was beautiful to God; who was reared three months in his father's house.

21. And he being exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and reared him for a son to her.

22. And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of Egyptians and was powerful in words and in works.

23. And when a period of forty years was fulfilled to him, it arose in his heart to look upon his brothers, the sons of Israel.

24. And seeing one being wronged, he defended him , and he avenged the one getting the worse, striking the Egyptian.

25. And he thought his brothers would understand that God would give them deliverance by his hand. But they did not understand.

26. And on the following day he appeared to them while fighting. And he urged them to peace, saying, Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?

27. But the one wronging the neighbor thrust him away, saying, "Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Do you not want to do away with me in the way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday?" Ex. 2:14

29. "And Moses fled" at this word. "And he became a tenant in Midian land," where he fathered two sons. Ex. 2:13-15   

30. And forty years being fulfilled to him, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.

31. And seeing, Moses marveled at the sight. And he coming up to look, a voice of the Lord came to him:

32. "I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Ex. 3:6, 15 But becoming trembly, Moses did not dare to look.

33. And the Lord said to him, "Loosen the sandal from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.

34. I surely saw the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I have heard their groan, and I came down to pluck them out. And now, come, I will send you to" Egypt. Ex. 3:5, 7, 8a, 10a

35. This Moses, whom they denied, saying, Who appointed you a ruler and a judge, this one God has sent as ruler and redeemer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the Bush.

36. This one led them out, having worked wonders and miracles in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea, and forty years in the wilderness.

37. This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, " The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet to you" "from your brothers, One like me." You shall hear Him. Deut. 18:15

38. This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living words to give to us,

39. to whom our fathers did not desire to be subject, but thrust him away, and turned their hearts back to Egypt,

40. saying to Aaron, "Make for us gods which will go before us; for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him." Ex. 32:1

41. And they made a calf in those days, and led a sacrifice up to the idol, and made merry in the works of their hands.   

42. But God turned and gave them over to serve the host of the heaven, as it has been written in the book of the Prophets: "Did you bring slain beasts and sacrifices to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

43. And you took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, the figures which you made" "in order to worship them. And I will remove you beyond" Babylon. Amos 7:45

44. The tabernacle of the testimony was among our fathers in the wilderness, as He who spoke to Moses commanded to make it according to the pattern which he had seen,

45. which also was brought in, our fathers having inherited with Joshua, in the taking of possession of the nations, whom God drove out from the face of our fathers, until the days of David,

46. who found favor before God and asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob;

47. but Solomon built Him a house.

48. But the Most High does not dwell in temples made by hand, as the prophet says,

49. "Heaven is My throne, and the earth a footstool of My feet; what house will you build Me," "says the Lord," "or what the place of My rest?"

50. "Did not My hands make all these things?" Isa. 66:1, 2   

51.  Oh stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and in the ears! You always fell against the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did , you also did .

52. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who before announced the coming of the Just One, of whom you now have become betrayers and murderers,

53. who received the Law by the disposition of angels and did not keep it .   

54. And hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts and gnashed the teeth on him.

55. But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into the heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right of God.

56. And he said, Behold, I see the heavens having been opened, and the Son of man standing at the right of God!

57. And crying out with a loud voice, they held their ears and rushed on him with one passion.

58. And throwing him outside the city, they stoned him . And the witnesses put off their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And placing the knees, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not make stand this sin to them. And saying this, he fell asleep.  

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was consenting to the doing away of him. And in that day a great persecution took place on the church which was in Jerusalem; and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And devout men together carried Stephen and made a great lamentation over him.

3. But Saul ravaged the church, entering house by house, dragging both men and women, he delivered them to prison.   

4. Then, indeed, the ones who had been scattered passed through, preaching the gospel, the Word.

5. And going down to a city of Samaria, Philip proclaimed Christ to them.

6. And with one passion the crowds heeded that being said by Philip when they heard and saw the many miracles which he did.

7. For many came out from those having unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice. And many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.

8. And great joy was in that city.

9. But a certain man named Simon had long been conjuring in the city and amazing the nation of Samaria, claiming himself to be some great one.

10. All were paying attention to him , from small to great, saying, This one is the power of God, which is great.

11. And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his conjuring.

12. But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel, the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13. And Simon himself also believed, and being baptized was continuing steadfastly with Philip. And seeing miracles and mighty works happening, he was amazed.   

14. And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,

15. who going down prayed concerning them so that they may receive the Holy Spirit.

16. For He had not yet fallen on any one of them, but they were only being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. But Simon having seen that the Holy Spirit is given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,

19. saying, Give to me also this authority that to whomever I may lay on the hands he may receive the Holy Spirit.

20. But Peter said to him, May your silver be with you into perdition, because you thought to get the gift of God through money.

21. There is neither part nor lot to you in this matter, for your heart is not upright before the face of God.

22. Repent, then, from this wickedness of yours, and petition God if perhaps you will be forgiven the thought of your heart.

23. For I see you being in the gall of bitterness and a bundle of unrighteousness.

24. And answering Simon said, You petition to the Lord for me, so that nothing of which you have spoken may come on me.

25. Then indeed having earnestly testified and having spoken the Word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, even having announced the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.   

26. But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go along south on the highway going down to Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a deserted place .

27. And rising up he went. And, behold, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, one in power with Candace the queen of Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship!

28. And he was returning. And sitting on his chariot he read the prophet Isaiah.

29. And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.

30. And running near Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Indeed, do you know what you are reading?

31. But he said, How should I be able except someone shall guide me? And he called Philip near, to come up to sit with him.

32. And the content of the Scripture which he was reading was this: "He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb voiceless before the one shearing it, so He does not open His mouth.

33. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; and who will recount His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth." Isa. 53:7, 8

34. And answering the eunuch said to Philip, I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself, or about some other one?

35. And opening his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, Philip announced the gospel to him, Jesus.

36. And as they were going along the highway they came on some water. And the eunuch said, Behold, water! What prevents me from being baptized?

37. And Philip said, If you believe from all the heart, it is lawful. And answering he said, I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.

38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

39. But when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip. And the eunuch did not see him any more; for he went his way rejoicing.

40. And Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.  

## Acts 9

1. But still breathing threats and murder toward the disciples of the Lord, coming to the high priest,

2. Saul asked from him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any being of the Way, both men and women, having bound them he might bring them to Jerusalem.

3. But in the going it happened! He drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the heaven shone around him.

4. And falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute Me?

5. And he said, Sir, who are you? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute; it is hard for you to kick against the prods.

6. Both trembling and being astonished he said, Lord, what do you desire me to do? And the Lord said to him, Rise up and go into the city, and it will be told you what you must do.

7. But the men traveling with him had been standing speechless, indeed hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

8. And Saul was lifted up from the earth, but his eyes being opened he saw no one. And leading him by the hand they brought him to Damascus.

9. And he was three days not seeing, and did not eat or drink.   

10. And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, Lord, I am here .

11. And the Lord said to him, Rising up pass along on the street being called Straight and seek a Tarsian, Saul by name, in the house of Judas. For, behold, he is praying.

12. And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting a hand on him, so that he may see again.

13. And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many bad things he did to Your saints in Jerusalem.

14. And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all the ones calling on Your name.

15. And the Lord said to him, Go, for this one is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel.

16. For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of My name.

17. And Ananias went away and entered into the house. And putting hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, Jesus, the One who appeared to you in the highway on which you came, that you may see and be filled of  the Holy Spirit.

18. And instantly it was as if scales fell away from his eyes. And rising up at the thing happening, he was baptized.

19. And taking food he was strengthened. And Saul was with the disciples in Damascus some days.

20. And at once in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that this One is the Son of God.

21. And all those hearing were amazed and said, Is this not the one destroying those who have called on this Name in Jerusalem, and he had come here for this, that binding them he might lead them before the chief priests?

22. But Saul was more filled with power, and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus, proving that this One is the Christ.   

23. And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews plotted together to do away with him.

24. But their plot was known to Saul. And they carefully watched the gates both by day and by night so that to do away with him.

25. But taking him by night the disciples let him down through the wall, lowering in a basket.

26. And Saul arriving in Jerusalem, he tried to be joined to the disciples. And all feared him, not believing that he is a disciple.

27. But taking hold of him, Barnabas led him to the apostles and told them how he saw the Lord in the highway, and that He spoke to him, and how in Damascus he spoke boldly in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them, going in and going out in Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.

29. And he spoke and disputed with the Hellenists, and they took him in hand to do away with him .

30. But knowing, the brothers led him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.

31. Then, indeed, the churches throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace, having been built up and having gone on in the fear of the Lord. And they were increased in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.   

32. And it happened, passing through all, Peter also came down to the saints dwelling in Lydda.

33. And he found there a certain man named Aeneas who had been lying on a mattress eight years, who was paralyzed.

34. And Peter said to him, Aeneas! Jesus the Christ heals you; rise up and spread for yourself. And instantly he rose up.

35. And all those dwelling in Lydda and the Sharon Plain saw him, who then turned to the Lord.   

36. And in Joppa was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which translated is called Dorcas Gazelle . She was full of good works and of alms which she did.

37. And it happened in those days, becoming ill, she died. And bathing her, they put her in an upper room.

38. And Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter is in it, they sent two men to him, begging him not to delay to come to them.

39. And rising up Peter went with them, and having arrived they led to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him, weeping and showing tunics and garments such as Dorcas made while being with them.

40. And putting all out, placing the knees Peter prayed. And turning to the body he said, Tabitha, Arise! And she opened her eyes. And seeing Peter she sat up.

41. And giving her a hand he raised her up. And calling the saints and the widows he presented her living.

42. And it became known through all Joppa. And many believed on the Lord.

43. And it was considerable days that he remained in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.  

## Acts 10

1. But a certain man named Cornelius was in Caesarea, a centurion of a cohort being called Italian,

2.  one devout and fearing God, with all his household, both doing many alms to the people and praying continually to God.

3. About the ninth hour of the day, he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, Cornelius!

4. And he was staring at him, and becoming terrified he said, What is it, Sir? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms went up for a memorial before God.

5. And now send men to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter.

6. This one is lodged with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you must do.

7. And when the angel speaking to Cornelius went away, calling two of his servants and a devout soldier of those continually waiting on him,

8. and having explained all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.   

9. And on the morrow, these passing along on the road, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray about the sixth hour.

10. And he became hungry and wished to taste food . But as they were preparing, an ecstasy fell on him.

11. And he saw the heaven being opened and a certain vessel like a great sheet coming down on him, being bound by four corners, and let down onto the earth;

12. in which were all the four-footed animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the heaven.

13. And a voice came to him, Rise up, Peter, slay and eat.

14. But Peter said, Not at all, Lord, because I never did eat anything common or unclean.

15. And again a voice came to him a second time , What things God made clean, you do not make common.

16. And this happened three times , and the vessel was taken up into the heaven again.

17. And as Peter was doubting within himself what the vision which he saw might be, even behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius stood on the porch asking out the house of Simon.

18. And calling out, they inquired if Simon being surnamed Peter is lodged here.   

19. And as Peter pondered concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you.

20. But rising up, go down and go with them, not discriminating, because I have sent them.

21. And going down to the men, the ones sent from Cornelius to him, Peter said, Behold, I am the one you seek. What is the cause for which you are here?

22. And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a just man and one fearing God, and being testified to by all the nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy angel to call you to his house and to hear words from you.

23. Then calling them in, he lodged them . And on the morrow Peter went out with them. And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

24. And on the morrow they entered Caesarea. And Cornelius was awaiting them, having called together his relatives and his intimate friends.

25. And as Peter was coming in, meeting him, Cornelius fell at his feet and worshiped.

26. But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up! I myself am also a man.

27. And talking with him, he went in and found many having come together.

28. And he said to them, You know how unlawful it is for a man, a Jew, to unite with or to come near to one of another race. Yet God showed to me not to call a man common or unclean.

29. Therefore, I also came without complaint, being summoned. Then I ask for what reason did you send for me?

30. And Cornelius said, From the fourth day until this hour I have been fasting, and the ninth hour I was praying in my house. And, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.

31. And he said, Cornelius, your prayer was heard and your alms were remembered before God.

32. Therefore, send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter; this one is lodged in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. Having come, he will speak to you.

33. Then at once I sent to you, and you did well to come. Now then, we are all present before God to hear all the things having been commanded you by God.   

34. And opening his mouth, Peter said, Truly I see that God is not an accepter of faces,

35. but in every nation the one fearing Him and working righteousness is acceptable to Him.

36. The Word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ, this One is Lord of all.

37. You know the thing that happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed,

38. Jesus the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all those having been oppressed by the Devil, because God was with Him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem. They did away with Him , hanging Him on a tree.

40. God raised up this One the third day and gave to Him to become visible;

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses, the ones having been before hand-picked by God, to us who ate and drank with Him after His rising again from the dead.

42. And He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to witness solemnly that it is He who has been marked out by God to be Judge of the living and the dead.

43. To this One all the Prophets witness, so that through His name everyone believing into Him will receive remission of sins.   

44. As Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those hearing the Word.

45. And the faithful of the circumcision were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the nations also.

46. For they heard them speaking in languages and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,

47. Can anyone forbid the water that these not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit received, even as we also?

48. And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain some days.  

## Acts 11

1. And the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the nations also received the Word of God.

2. And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,

3. saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them.

4. But beginning, Peter set out to them in order, saying,

5. I was being in the city of Joppa, praying. And in an ecstasy, I saw a vision: a certain vessel was coming down, like a huge sheet, being let down by four corners out of the heaven; and it came as far as me.

6. Looking intently on this , I observed. And I saw the four-footed animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the heaven.

7. And I heard a voice saying to me, Peter, rise up, slay and eat.

8. But I said, Not at all, Lord, because never has anything common or unclean entered into my mouth.

9. But a voice answered me the second time out of the heaven, What God has cleansed, you do not make common.

10. And this took place three times , and all things were pulled up into the heaven again.

11. And, behold, at once three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.

12. And the Spirit said to me to go with them, not discriminating. And these six brothers also were with me, and we went into the man's house.

13. And he told us how he saw an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon who is surnamed Peter,

14. who will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.

15. And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as also on us in the beginning.

16. And I recalled the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.

17. Then if God gave the same gift to them as also to us, believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, and I, who was I to be able to prevent God?

18. And hearing these things, they kept silent and glorified God, saying, Then God also has granted to the nations repentance unto life.   

19. Then, indeed, they who were scattered by the oppression taking place over Stephen passed through to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the Word to no one except only to Jews.

20. But some men from them, Cypriots and Cyrenians, who had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, announcing the gospel of the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believing, they turned to the Lord.

22. And the Word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem concerning them. And they sent out Barnabas to go through as far as Antioch;

23. who having come, and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced. And he exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide near the Lord.

24. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.

25. And Barnabas went out to Tarsus to seek Saul.

26. And finding him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened that many of them were gathered to them in the church a whole year. And they taught a considerable crowd. And the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.   

27. And in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. And one of them named Agabus rising up, he signified through the Spirit that a great famine was about to be over all the habitable earth, which also happened on Claudius Caesar's time .

29. And according as any was prospered, the disciples, each of them, determined to send for ministry to those brothers living in Judea,

30. which they also did, sending to the elders through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.  

## Acts 12

1. And at that time Herod the king threw on the hands to oppress some of those of the church.

2. And with a sword he did away with James the brother of John.

3. And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he added also to seize Peter, (and they were the days of Unleavened Bread )

4. whom also capturing him , he put him into prison, delivering him to four sets of four soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him up to the people after the Passover.   

5. Then Peter was indeed kept in the prison, but fervent prayer was made by the church to God on his behalf.

6. But when Herod was about to bring him out, in that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, being bound with two chains, also guards were keeping the prison before the door.

7. And, behold! An angel of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the building. And striking Peter's side, he raised him up, saying, Rise up in haste! And the chains fell off from his hands.

8. And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Throw around your garment and follow me.

9. And going out, he followed him, and did not know that this happening through the angel was real, but he thought he saw a vision.

10. And going through a first and a second guard, they came on the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to them of itself. And going out, they went on one street; and instantly the angel withdrew from him.

11. And having come, Peter said within himself, Now I know truly that the Lord sent out His angel and plucked me out of Herod's hand, and out of all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. And considering, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, the one being surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together, and praying.

13. And Peter was knocking at the door of the porch, and a servant girl named Rhoda came near to listen.

14. And recognizing Peter's voice, from joy she did not open the porch, but running in she reported Peter was standing before the porch.

15. But they said to her, You are raving. But she insisted, holding it to be so. And they said, It is his angel.

16. But Peter kept on knocking. And opening, they saw him and were amazed.

17. And signaling to them with the hand to be silent, he told them how the Lord led him out of the prison. And he said, Report these things to James and the brothers. And going out, he went to another place.

18. And day having come, there was not a little disturbance among the soldiers, saying , What, then, became of Peter?

19. And searching for him, and not finding him , examining the guards, Herod commanded them to be led away. And going down from Judea to Caesarea, he stayed.   

20. And Herod was in bitter hostility with the Tyrians and Sidonians. But with one passion they came to him. And persuading Blastus, the one over the king's bedroom, they begged peace, because their country was fed from the royal bounty .

21. And on a set day, having been clothed in a regal garment, and sitting on the tribunal, Herod made a speech to them.

22. And the mass of people cried out, The voice of a god, and not of a man!

23. And instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God. And having been eaten by worms, his soul went out.

24. But the Word of God grew and increased.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled the service, and having taken with them the one surnamed Mark.  

## Acts 13

1. And in Antioch some among the existing church were prophets and teachers: both Barnabas and Simeon, he being called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

2. And while they were doing service to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, So then separate both Barnabas and Saul to Me, for the work to which I have called them.

3. Then, having fasted and prayed, and placing hands on them, they let them go.   

4. Then these indeed sent out by the Holy Spirit went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed away to Cyprus.

5. And having been in Salamis, they announced the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as a helper.

6. And passing through the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain conjurer, a false prophet, a Jew named Bar-jesus.

7.  He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This one having called Barnabas and Saul to him, he sought to hear the Word of God.

8. But Elymas, the conjurer (for so his name is translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

9. But Saul, who is also Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking intently on him,

10.  he said, O son of the Devil, full of all guile and of all cunning, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?

11. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun until a time. And instantly a mist and darkness fell on him, and going about he sought some to lead him by the hand.

12. Then seeing the thing happening, the proconsul believed, being astounded at the doctrine of the Lord.

13. And putting out from Paphos with those around him , Paul came to Perga of Pamphylia. And separating from them, John returned to Jerusalem.   

14. But going through from Perga, they came to Antioch-Pisidia, and going into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.

15. And after the reading of the Law, and of the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if there is a word of exhortation to the people, speak.

16. And rising up, and signaling with his hand, Paul said: Men, Israelites, and the ones fearing God, listen.

17. The God of this people Israel chose out our fathers, and exalted the people in their stay in the land of Egypt. And with a high arm, He led them out of it.

18. And as forty years time passed , He tenderly bore them in the wilderness. Deut. 1:31

19. And He pulled down seven nations in Canaan land, and gave their land to them as an inheritance. Deut. 7:1

20. And after these things, as four hundred and fifty years passed , He gave judges until Samuel the prophet.

21. And from there they asked for a king. And God gave Saul the son of Kish to them, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

22. And removing him, He raised up to them David for a king, to whom He also said, witnessing, "I found David" the son of Jesse " to be a man according to My own heart, who will do all My will." 1 Samuel 13:14; Psa. 89:20; LXX-Isa. 44:28

23. Of the seed of this one, according to promise, God raised up to Israel a Savior, Jesus;

24. John going before to proclaim before the face of His entrance a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

25. And as John fulfilled the course, he said, Whom do you suppose me to be? I am not He , but, behold, "He comes after me, of whom I am not worthy to loosen the sandal of His feet." John 1:27

26. Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and the ones among you fearing God, to you the word of this salvation was sent.

27. For those dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known this One, and the voices of the prophets being read throughout every sabbath, condemning Him , they fulfilled the Scriptures .

28. And finding not one cause of death, they asked Pilate to do away with Him.

29. And when they finished all the things having been written concerning Him, taking Him down from the tree, they laid Him in a tomb.

30. But God raised Him from the dead;

31. who appeared for many days to those coming up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are witnesses of Him to the people.

32. And we preach the gospel to you, the promise made to the fathers,

33. that this God has fulfilled to us, their children, raising up Jesus; as also it has been written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son, today I have begotten You." Psa. 2:7

34. And that He raised Him from the dead, no more being about to return to corruption, so He has said, "I will give You" "the holy things of faithful David." Isa. 55:3

35. So He also said in another, "You will not give Your Holy One to see corruption." LXX-Psa. 15:10; MT-Psa. 16:10

36. For having served his own generation by the counsel of God, David truly fell asleep and was added to his fathers and saw corruption. 1 Kg. 2:10

37. But He whom God raised up, this One did not see corruption.

38. Then let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One remission of sin is announced to you.

39. And everyone believing in this One is justified from all things which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses.

40. Then watch that the thing spoken in the Prophets may not come on you:

41. "Behold, you despisers," "and marvel," "and perish, because I work a work in your days," a work which you would "in no way believe if anyone declares it to you." Hab. 1:5   

42. But the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations begged that these words be spoken to them on the next sabbath.

43. And the synagogue being broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44. And in the coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered to hear the Word of God.

45. And the Jews seeing the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things being spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

46. But speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, It was necessary for the Word of God to be spoken first to you; but since you indeed thrust it away and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the nations.

47. For so the Lord has commanded us, "I have set You for a Light of nations, that You be for salvation to the end of the earth." Isa. 49:6

48. And hearing, the nations rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.

49. And the Word of the Lord was carried through all the country.

50. But the Jews excited the devout and honorable women, and the chief ones of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out from their borders.

51. But these shaking off the dust of their feet on them, they came into Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.  

## Acts 14

1. And it happened in Iconium, they went in together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke so as for a huge multitude of both Jews and Greeks to believe.

2. But the unbelieving Jews raised up and made malignant the souls of the nations against the brothers.

3. Then, indeed, they stayed a considerable time, speaking boldly on the Lord, witnessing to the Word of His grace, and He giving miracles and wonders to occur through their hands.

4. And the multitude of the city was divided; and some were with the Jews, but others with the apostles.

5. And when a rush of the nations occurred, and both the Jews and their rulers came to insult and to stone them,

6. perceiving this , they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country.

7. And they were announcing the gospel there.   

8. And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, powerless in the feet, being lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.

9. This one heard Paul speaking, who, looking intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be cured,

10.  he said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet! And he leaped up and walked about.

11. And seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice in Lycaonian, saying, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men.

12. And they called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the leader in speaking.

13. And the priest of Zeus being before their city, carrying bulls and garlands to the gates, he wished to sacrifice along with the crowds.

14. But Paul and Barnabas, the apostles, hearing, tearing their garments, they sprang into the crowd, crying out,

15. and saying, Men, why do you do these things? We also are men of like feelings to you, announcing the gospel to you to turn you from these vanities to the living God, who "made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them," Ex. 20:11

16. who in the generations which have passed allowed all the nations to go in their own ways,

17. though indeed He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving rain and fruitful seasons to us from heaven, filling our hearts with food and gladness.

18. And saying these things, they hardly stopped the crowds, that they not sacrifice to them.   

19. But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium, and persuading the crowds, and stoning Paul, they dragged him outside the city, supposing him to have died.

20. But the disciples surrounding him, arising he entered into the city. And on the morrow he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. And having announced the gospel to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,

22. confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God.

23. And having handpicked elders for them in every church, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed.

24. And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

25. And speaking the Word in Perga, they came down to Attalia,

26. and from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

27. And having arrived, and gathering the church, they reported what things God did with them and that He opened a door of faith to the nations.

28. And they remained there not a little time with the disciples.  

## Acts 15

1. And going down from Judea, some taught the brothers, saying , If you are not circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.

2. Then dissension and not a little disputation with them having taken place by Paul and Barnabas, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to go up into Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this question.

3. Then, indeed, having been sent forward by the church they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, fully narrating the conversion of the nations. And they were producing great joy among all the brothers.

4. And having arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders. And they reported what things God did with them.

5. But some of those rose up from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.   

6. And the apostles and the elders were assembled to see about this matter.

7. And much disputation having occurred, rising up Peter said to them: Men, brothers, you recognize that from ancient days, God chose among us that through my mouth the nations should hear the Word of the gospel, and to believe.

8. And the heart knowing God testified to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us.

9. And He made distinction in nothing between both us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.

10. Now, then, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we had strength to bear?

11. But through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, according to which manner they also believed .

12. And all the multitude kept silent and were hearing Barnabas and Paul recounting what things God did through them among the nations, even the signs and wonders.

13. And after they were silent, James responded, saying, Men, brothers, hear me:

14. Simon recounted how even as at first God oversaw to take a people out from among the nations for His name.

15. And with this agree the words of the prophets, as it has been written,

16. After these things "I" will return and "will build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen," "and I will build again the things which have been demolished," and I will set it up, Amos 9:11, 12

17. so as the rest of men may seek the Lord, "even all the nations on whom My name has been called, says the Lord, who is doing all these things." Amos 9:11, 12

18. All His works are known to God from eternity.

19. For this reason I judge not to trouble those from the nations turning to God,

20. but to write to them to hold back from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and that strangled, and blood.

21. For in every city from ancient generations Moses has those proclaiming him, having been read in the synagogues on every sabbath.   

22. Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with all the church, to send chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, Judas having been surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,

23. writing by their hand these things: The apostles and the elders and the brothers, to those throughout Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brothers from the nations: Greeting.

24. Since we heard that some of us having gone out have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, Be circumcised and keep the Law, to whom we gave no command;

25. it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to send chosen men to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. men who have given up their souls on behalf of the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

27. Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, they by word also announcing the same things.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to put not one greater burden on you than these necessary things:

29. To hold back from idol sacrifices, and blood, and that strangled, and from fornication; from which continually keeping yourselves, you will do well. Be prospered.

30. Then they indeed being let go, they went to Antioch. And gathering the multitude, they delivered the letter.

31. And reading it , they rejoiced at the comfort.

32. And Judas and Silas, themselves also being prophets, exhorted the brothers through much speech, and confirmed them .

33. And continuing for a time, they were let go with peace from the brothers to the apostles.

34. But it seemed good to Silas to remain.

35. And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the gospel, the Word of the Lord, with many others also.   

36. And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Indeed, having turned back, let us look after our brothers throughout every city in which we announced the Word of the Lord, how they are holding it.

37. But Barnabas purposed to take John with them , the one having been called Mark.

38. But Paul thought it well not to take that one with them , he having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and not going with them to the work.

39. Then there was sharp feeling, so as to separate them from each other. And taking Mark, Barnabas sailed away to Cyprus.

40. But having chosen Silas, Paul went out, being commended to the grace of God by the brothers

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches strong.  

## Acts 16

1. And he arrived in Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a certain believing Jewish woman, but his father was a Greek.

2.  This one was being testified of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.

3. Paul desired this one to go forth with him, and taking him he circumcised him, because of the Jews being in those places. For they all knew his father, that he was a Greek.

4. And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the need to keep the decrees that had been determined by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem.

5. Then indeed the churches were being made stronger in the faith, and increased in number day by day.   

6. And passing through the Phrygian and the Galatian country, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the Word in Asia,

7. coming against Mysia, they attempted to go along Bithynia, and the Spirit did not allow them.

8. And passing by Mysia, they came down into Troas.

9. And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: a certain man of Macedonia was standing, entreating him and saying, Passing over into Macedonia, help us!

10. And when he saw the vision, we immediately sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce the gospel to them.

11. Then having set sail from Troas, we ran a straight course into Samothrace, and on the morrow into Neapolis,

12. and from there into Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in this city, staying some days.

13. And on the day of the sabbaths, we went outside the city beside a river, where it was customary for prayer to be made . And sitting down, we spoke to the women who came together there .

14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one reverencing God, listened, whose heart the Lord opened thoroughly to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul.

15. And as she and her household were baptized, she entreated Paul , saying, If you have judged me to be believing in the Lord, entering into my house, remain. And she strongly urged us.   

16. And it happened, as we went into a place of prayer, a certain girl slave having a Pythonic spirit met us, whose divining brought much gain to her lords.

17. Following after Paul and us, she cried out, saying, These men are slaves of the Most High God, who are announcing to us a way of salvation!

18. And she did this over many days. But becoming distressed, and turning to the demonic spirit, Paul said, In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out from her! And it came out in that same hour.

19. And seeing that the hope of their gain went out, having seized Paul and Silas, her lords dragged them to the market before the rulers.

20. And bringing them near to the magistrates, they said, These men are very much troubling our city, being Jews,

21. and announce customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor to do, being Romans.

22. And the crowd rose up against them. And tearing off their clothes, the magistrates ordered men to flog them .

23. And laying on them many stripes, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely,

24. who, receiving such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and locked their feet in the stocks.   

25. And having prayed, toward midnight Paul and Silas praised God in a hymn. And the prisoners listened to them.

26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the jail were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and all of the bonds were loosened.

27. And having been awakened, and seeing that the doors of the prison had been opened, having drawn a sword, the jailer was about to do away with himself, supposing the prisoners to have escaped.

28. But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do no harm to yourself! For we are all here.

29. And asking for lights, he rushed in. And becoming trembly, he fell before Paul and Silas.

30. And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?

31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.

32. And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all those in his house.

33. And taking them in that hour of the night, he washed from their stripes. And he and all those belonging to him were baptized at once.

34. And bringing them up to the house, he set a table before them , and exulted whole-housely, believing God.   

35. And day having come, the magistrates sent the floggers, saying, let those men go.

36. And the jailer announced these words to Paul, The magistrates have sent that you be let go. Now, then, going out, proceed in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, being Romans and uncondemned men, they threw us into prison. And now do they throw us out secretly? No, indeed! But coming themselves, let them bring us out.

38. And the floggers reported these words to the magistrates. And hearing that they were Romans, they were afraid.

39. And coming, they begged them . And bringing them out, they asked them to go out of the city.

40. And going out from the prison, they went into the house of Lydia. And seeing the brothers, they exhorted them, and went out.  

## Acts 17

1. And traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them and reasoned with them from the Scriptures on three sabbaths,

3. opening and setting forth that the Christ must have suffered, and to have risen from the dead, and that this is the Christ, Jesus, whom I announce to you.

4. And some of them were persuaded and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, both a great multitude of the worshiping Greeks, and not a few of the leading women.

5. But becoming jealous, and having taken aside some wicked men of the market loafers, and gathering a crowd, the disobeying Jews set the city into turmoil. And coming on the house of Jason, they sought to bring them on to the mob.

6. But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city judges, crying, Those turning the habitable world upside down have come here, too;

7. whom Jason has received. And these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.

8. And hearing these things, they troubled the crowd and the city judges.

9. And taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.   

10. But the brothers at once sent both Paul and Silas to Berea during the night; who having arrived went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. And these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the Word with all readiness, daily examining the Scriptures if these things are so .

12. Then indeed many from among them believed, and not a few of the honorable Greek women and men.

13. But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was also announced in Berea by Paul, they came there also, shaking up the crowd.

14. And immediately, then, the brothers sent away Paul, to go as toward the sea. But both Silas and Timothy remained there.

15. But those conducting Paul brought him as far as Athens. And receiving a command to Silas and Timothy that they come to him quickly, they departed.   

16. But awaiting them in Athens, Paul's spirit was pained within him, seeing the city full of images.

17. Then, indeed, he addressed the Jews in the synagogue, and those worshiping, also in the market every day, to those happening to be there .

18. And some of the Epicureans and of the Stoics, philosophers, fell in with him. And some said, What may this chatterer wish to say? And these others , He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons (because he announced Jesus and the resurrection to them).

19. And taking hold of him, they led him to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what is this new doctrine being spoken by you?

20. For you bring startling things to our ears. We are minded, then, to know what these things wish to be.

21. And all Athenians and the strangers living there have leisure for nothing else than to say and to hear newer things.   

22. And standing in the middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Men, Athenians, I see how you in everything are fearful of gods;

23. for passing through and looking up at the objects of your worship, I also found an altar on which had been written, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Not knowing, then, whom you worship, I make Him known to you.

24. The God who made the world and all things in it, this One being Lord of Heaven and of earth, does not dwell in handmade temples,

25. nor is served by hands of men, as having need of anything. For He is giving life and breath and all things to all.

26. And He made every nation of men of one blood, to live on all the face of the earth, ordaining fore-appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling,

27. to seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after Him and might find Him, though indeed He not being far from each one of us.

28. For in Him we live and move and exist, as also some of the poets among you have said, For we are also His offspring.

29. Then being offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, engraved by art and the imagination of man.

30. Truly, then, God overlooking the times of ignorance, now strictly commands all men everywhere to repent,

31. because He set a day in which "He is going to judge the habitable world in righteousness," by a Man whom He appointed; having given proof to all by raising Him from the dead. Psa. 9:8   

32. And hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some indeed ridiculed, but said, We will hear you again concerning this.

33. And so Paul went out from their midst.

34. But some men believed, joining themselves to him, among whom also were both Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.  

## Acts 18

1. And after these things, departing from Athens, Paul came to Corinth.

2. And finding a certain Jew named Aquila, of Pontus by race, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome, he came to them.

3. And because he was of the same trade, he lived and worked with them; for they were tentmakers by trade.

4. And he reasoned in the synagogue on every sabbath persuading both Jews and Greeks.

5. And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed by the Spirit, earnestly testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

6. But they having resisted, and blaspheming, having shaken his garments, he said to them, Your blood be on your head. I am pure from it ; from now on I will go to the nations.   

7. And moving from there, he went into the house of one named Justus, one worshiping God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.

8. And Crispus, the synagogue ruler, believed the Lord along with all his house. And hearing, many of the Corinthians believed and were baptized.

9. And the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, Do not fear, but speak, and do not keep silence;

10. because I am with you, and no one shall set on you to oppress you; because there is much people to Me in this city.

11. And he remained a year and six months teaching the Word of God among them.   

12. But Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rushed against Paul with one passion and led him to the tribunal,

13. saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the Law.

14. But Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If, indeed, then, it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, according to reason I would endure you.

15. But if it is a question about a word, and names, and the law according to you, you will see to it yourselves; for I do not wish to be a judge of these things.

16. And he drove them from the tribunal.

17. And all the Greeks having seized Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the tribunal. And not one of these things mattered to Gallio.   

18. And having remained many days more, having taken leave of the brothers, Paul sailed to Syria, having shaved his head, in Cenchrea, for he had a vow. And Priscilla and Aquila were with him.

19. And he came to Ephesus, and he left those there. But he going into the synagogue, he reasoned with the Jews.

20. And they asking him to remain over a longer time with them, he did not agree,

21. but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem; but I will come again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.

22. And landing at Caesarea, having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.

23. And spending some time, he went out, in order passing through the Galatian and Phrygian country, making strong all the disciples.   

24. But a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, being powerful in the Scriptures.

25. This one having been taught by mouth in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things about the Lord, having understood only the baptism of John.

26. And this one began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And hearing him Priscilla and Aquila took him and more accurately expounded the way of God to him.

27. And he having intended to go through into Achaia, having been encouraged, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him; who, having arrived, much helped those who were believing through grace.

28. For he powerfully confuted the Jews publicly, proving through the Scriptures Jesus to be the Christ.  

## Acts 19

1. And it happened, in the time Apollos was in Corinth, Paul was passing through the higher parts to come to Ephesus. And finding some disciples,

2. he said to them, Believing, did you receive the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, We did not even hear whether the Holy Spirit is.

3. And he said to them, Then to what were you baptized? And they said, To the baptism of John.

4. And Paul said, John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into the One coming after him, that is, into the Christ, Jesus.

5. And hearing, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And Paul laying hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in languages and prophesied.

7. And all the men were about twelve.   

8. And going into the synagogue, he spoke boldly over three months, having reasoned with them , and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God.

9. But when some were hardened, and did not obey, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, departing from them, He separated the disciples, conversing day by day in the school of a certain Tyrannus.

10. And this happened over two years, so as all those living in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

11. And God did uncommon works of power through the hands of Paul,

12. so as even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin to be brought onto those sick, and the diseases to be released from them, and the evil spirits to go out from them.   

13. But certain from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.

14. And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this.

15. But answering the evil spirit said, I know Jesus, and I comprehend Paul, but who are you?

16. And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, and overcoming them, he was strong against them, and having been wounded, they fled out of the house naked.

17. And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, those living in Ephesus. And fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. And many of those who had believed came confessing, and declaring their deeds.

19. And many of the ones practicing the curious arts, bringing together the books, burned them before all. And they counted the prices of them, and found it to be five ten thousands of silver.

20. So with might, the Word of the Lord increased and was strong.   

21. And when these things were fulfilled, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have come there, I must also see Rome.

22. And sending into Macedonia two who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he stayed a time in Asia.

23. And about that time there was no little disturbance about the Way.

24. For a certain silversmith named Demetrius was making silver shrines of Artemis, providing no little trade for the craftsmen.

25. And assembling the workmen about such things, he said, Men, you understand that from this trade is our wealth.

26. And you see and hear that not only Ephesus, but almost all of Asia, persuading, this Paul perverted a huge crowd, saying that those being made by hands are not gods.

27. And not only is this dangerous to us, lest our part come to be in contempt, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted nothing, and her majesty is also about to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.

28. And hearing, and having become full of anger, they cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!

29. And all the city was filled with confusion. And they rushed with one passion into the theater, keeping a firm grip on Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.

30. And Paul intending to go in to the mob, the disciples did not allow him.

31. And also some of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sending to him begged him not to give himself into the theater.

32. Then others indeed cried out a different thing, for the assembly was confused, and the majority did not know on what account they came together.

33. But they dragged Alexander forward out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him in front. And waving his hand, Alexander desired to defend himself to the mob.

34. But knowing that he is a Jew, one voice was from all, as they were crying out over two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!

35. And quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, Men, Ephesians, for what man is there who does not know the city of the Ephesians to be temple keepers of the great goddess Artemis, and of That Fallen From the Sky?

36. Then these things being undeniable, it is necessary for you, having been calmed, to be so , and to do nothing rash.

37. For you brought these men, being neither temple robbers nor blaspheming your goddess.

38. If then, indeed, Demetrius and those craftsmen with him have a matter against anyone, courts are being held , and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.

39. But if you seek concerning other things, it will be settled in a lawful assembly.

40. For we are in danger to be accused of insurrection concerning today, there being no cause about which we will be able to give account of this crowding together.

41. And saying these things, he dismissed the assembly.  

## Acts 20

1. And after the ceasing of the tumult, having called the disciples, and having greeted them , Paul went away to go into Macedonia.

2. And passing through those parts, and exhorting them with much speech, he came into Greece.

3. And spending three months there , a plot by the Jews being against him, being about to sail into Syria, he was of a mind to return through Macedonia.

4. And Sopater, a Berean; and Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia accompanied him as far as Asia.

5. Going forward, these awaited us in Troas.

6. But we sailed along after the days of Unleavened Bread from Philippi, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.   

7. And on the first of the week, the disciples having been assembled to break bread, being about to depart on the morrow, Paul reasoned to them. And he continued his speech until midnight.

8. And many lamps were in the upper room where they were gathered.

9. And a certain young man named Eutychus was sitting on the window sill, being overborne by deep sleep, Paul reasoning for a longer time, having been overborne by the sleep, he fell from the third floor down and was taken up dead.

10. But going down Paul fell on him, and embracing him , he said, Do not be terrified, for his soul is in him.

11. And going up, and breaking bread, and tasting, and conversing over a long time , until daybreak, he went out thus.

12. And they brought the boy alive and were comforted not a little.   

13. But going before onto the ship, we set sail for Assos, being about to take Paul in there; for so it had been arranged, he being about to go on foot.

14. And when he met us in Assos, taking him up we came to Mitylene.

15. And sailing away from there, on the next day we arrived off Chios, and on the next we crossed to Samos. And remaining at Trogyllium, the next day we came to Miletus.

16. For Paul had decided to sail by Ephesus, so as it might not happen to him to spend time in Asia; for he hastened if it were possible for him to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.   

17. And sending to Ephesus from Miletus, he called for the elders of the church.

18. And when they came to him, he said to them: You understand, from the first day on which I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,

19. serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears and trials happening to me by the plots of the Jews;

20. as I kept nothing back of what is profitable, so as not to tell you, and to teach you publicly, and from house to house,

21. earnestly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, behold, being bound by the Spirit, I go to Jerusalem, not knowing the things going to meet me in it,

23. but that the Holy Spirit testifies city by city saying that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But I make account of nothing, nor do I hold my life precious to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, fully to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

25. And now, behold, I know that you all will see my face no more, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom of God.

26. Because of this I testify to you on this day that I am pure from the blood of all.

27. For I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.

28. Then take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit placed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased through His own blood.

29. For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;

30. and out of you yourselves will rise up men speaking perverted things, in order to draw away the disciples after themselves.

31. Because of this watch, remembering that I did not cease admonishing each one with tears night and day for three years.

32. And now, brothers, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build up and to give you inheritance among all those having been sanctified.

33. I have desired the silver, or gold, or clothing of no one.

34. But you yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs, and to those who were with me.

35. I showed you all things, that working in this way we ought to help those being weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.   

36. And saying these things, placing his knees, he prayed with them all.

37. And there was much weeping of all, and falling on the neck of Paul, they ardently kissed him,

38. most of all grieving for the word which he said, that they were going to see his face no more. And they went with him to the ship.  

## Acts 21

1. And when it was time to sail, we having been torn away from them, running direct we came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.

2. And finding a ship crossing over to Phoenice, going on board we set sail:

3. and sighting Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and came down to Tyre; for the ship was unloading the cargo there.

4. And finding disciples, we remained there seven days; who told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.

5. But when it was time for us to complete the days, going out, we traveled. And they , with all the women and children went with us as far as outside the city. And placing the knees on the shore, we prayed.

6. And giving parting greetings to one another, we went up into the ship, and those went back to their own.

7. And completing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. And having greeted the brothers, we remained one day with them.   

8. And on the morrow, those around him going out, Paul came to Caesarea. And going into the house of Philip the evangelist, he being of the Seven, we stayed with him.

9. And there were four virgin daughters to this one, who prophesied.

10. And we remaining more days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.

11. And coming to us, and taking Paul's girdle, and binding his hands and feet, he said, The Holy Spirit says these things : In Jerusalem the Jews will bind in this way the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him up into the hands of the nations.

12. And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. But Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I not only am ready to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done .   

15. And after these days, having made ready, we went up to Jerusalem.

16. And also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing Mnason, a certain Cypriot, an ancient disciple, with whom we might lodge.

17. And we being in Jerusalem, the brothers joyfully received us.

18. And on the next day , Paul went in with us to James. And all the elders came.

19. And having greeted them, he related one by one what things God had worked among the nations through his ministry.

20. And hearing, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many myriads there are of Jews that have believed, and all are zealous ones of the Law.

21. And they were informed about you, that you teach falling away from Moses, telling all the Jews throughout the nations not to circumcise their children, nor to walk in the customs.

22. What then is it? At all events, a multitude must come together, for they will hear that you have come.

23. Then do this, what we say to you: There are four men who have a vow on themselves;

24. taking these, be purified with them, and be at expense on them, that they may shave the head. And all shall know that all what they have been told about you is nothing, but you yourself walk orderly, keeping the Law.

25. And as to the believing nations, we joined in writing, judging them to observe no such thing, except to keep themselves from both idol sacrifice, and the blood, and a thing strangled, and from fornication.

26. Then taking the men on the next day, being purified with them, Paul went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification, until the offering should be offered for each one of them.   

27. But when the seven days were about to be completed, having seen him in the temple, the Jews from Asia stirred up all the crowd, and they laid hands on him,

28. crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people and the Law and this place. And even more, he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.

29. For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul brought into the temple.

30. And the whole city was moved, and there was a running together of people. And having laid hold of Paul, they drew him outside of the temple, and at once the doors were shut.

31. But as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the chiliarch of the cohort, that all Jerusalem is in a tumult.

32.  He at once ran down to them, taking soldiers and centurions. And seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

33. Then going near, the chiliarch laid hold of him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. And he asked who he might be, and what he is doing.

34. But others cried something else in the crowd, and not being able to know the certainty because of the uproar, he commanded him brought into the fortress.

35. But when he came on the stairs, it happened he was borne by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.

36. For the multitude of the people followed, crying out, Take him away!

37. But being about to be brought into the fortress, Paul said to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say a thing to you? And he said, Do you know to speak in Greek?

38. Then are you not the Egyptian who before these days caused a riot, and led four thousand men of the assassins out into the desert?

39. But Paul said, Indeed I am a man, a Jew of Tarsus, of Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.

40. And he allowing him, standing on the stairs, Paul signaled with his hand to the people. And much silence taking place, he spoke in the Hebrew dialect, saying,  

## Acts 22

1. Men, brothers, and fathers, hear my defense now to you.

2. And hearing that he spoke in the Hebrew dialect to them, they showed more quietness. And he said:   

3. Indeed I am a man, a Jew having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but having been brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, having been trained according to the exactness of the ancestral law, being a zealous one of God, even as you all are today.

4.  I persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering up both men and women to prisons,

5. as also the high priest and all the elderhood witnesses to me. And having received letters from them to the brothers, I traveled into Damascus even to lead those to Jerusalem being bound there, in order that they might be punished.

6. And it happened to me, traveling and drawing near to Damascus: suddenly, about midday, a great light out of the heaven shone around me.

7. And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?

8. And I answered, Who are you, Sir? And He said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you persecute.

9. But those being with me indeed saw the light, and were alarmed, but did not hear His voice speaking to me.

10. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rising up, go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all things which are appointed to you to do.

11. And as I did not see, from the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those being with me, I went into Damascus.

12. And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, testified to by all the Jews living there ,

13. coming to me and standing by, he said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And in the same hour I looked up on him.

14. And he said, The God of our fathers appointed you to know His will, and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice out of His mouth;

15. for you shall be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.

16. And now what do you intend? Rising up, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

17. And it happened to me, returning to Jerusalem and praying in the temple: I became in an ecstasy,

18. and I saw Him saying to me, Hurry and go out quickly from Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.

19. And I said, Lord, they understand that I was imprisoning and beating the ones believing on You throughout the synagogues.

20. And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was poured out, I myself also was standing by and consenting to his execution, and holding the garments of those killing him.

21. And He said to me, Go, for I will send you to the nations afar off.   

22. And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Take such a one from the earth, for it is not fitting that he should live!

23. And they shouting, and tearing the garments, and throwing dust into the air,

24. the chiliarch ordered to bring him into the fortress, saying for him to be examined with scourges, that he may know for what crime they cried out so against him.

25. But as they stretched him with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful for you to flog a man, a Roman not found guilty?

26. And hearing, coming near the centurion reported to the chiliarch, saying, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.

27. And coming up, the chiliarch said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.

28. And the chiliarch answered, I bought this citizenship with a great sum. And Paul said, But I even was born free .

29. Then at once those being about to examine him stood away from him. And the chiliarch also feared, fully knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.

30. And on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty as to why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds. And he commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to come. And bringing Paul down, he set  him among them.  

## Acts 23

1. And looking on the sanhedrin, Paul said, Men, brothers, I in all good conscience have conducted myself toward God to this day.

2. But Ananias the high priest ordered those standing by him to strike his mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, whitened wall! And do you sit judging me according to the Law, and contrary to the Law command me to be stricken?

4. And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God?

5. And Paul said, Brothers, I did not know that he is high priest; for it has been written, "You shall not speak evil" "of a ruler of your people." Ex. 22:28   

6. But knowing that the one part consisted of Sadducees, and the other of Pharisees, Paul cried out in the sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am being judged concerning hope and resurrection of the dead!

7. And he having spoken this, there was a discord between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.

8. For the Sadducees indeed say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit. But Pharisees confess both.

9. And there was a great cry. And the scribes of the part of the Pharisees rising up, they were contending, saying, We find nothing evil in this man. And, If a spirit spoke to him, or an angel, let us not fight against God.

10. And discord having arisen, fearing lest Paul should be torn by them, the chiliarch commanded the soldiery to go down to snatch him out of their midst, and to bring him into the fortress.

11. And coming to him in the following night the Lord said, Be cheered, Paul, for as you fully testified the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify at Rome.   

12. And it becoming day, some of the Jews making a conspiracy cursed themselves, saying neither to eat nor to drink until they should kill Paul.

13. And those making this plot were more than forty;

14. who coming near to the chief priests and to the elders these said, With a curse we have cursed ourselves to taste of nothing until we shall kill Paul.

15. Now, then, you with the sanhedrin inform the chiliarch, so that tomorrow he may bring him down to you, as intending more accurately to find out about him. And before his drawing near, we are ready to kill him.

16. But the son of Paul's sister hearing of the ambush, having come near, and entering into the fortress, reported to Paul.

17. And calling near one of the centurions, Paul said, Bring this young man to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him.

18. Then indeed taking him, he brought him to the chiliarch and said, Paul the prisoner having called me near asked me to bring this young man to you, having a thing to tell you.

19. And laying hold of his hand, and drawing aside privately, the chiliarch asked, What is it that you have to report to me?

20. And he said, The Jews agreed to ask you that tomorrow you bring down Paul into the sanhedrin, as being about to inquire more accurately concerning him.

21. Therefore, you must not be persuaded by them, for more than forty men of them lie in wait for him who put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they kill him. And now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you.

22. Then the chiliarch sent away the young man, charging him , Tell no one that you reported these things to me.

23. And having called near a certain two of the centurions, he said, Get two hundred soldiers ready, so that they may go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, from the third hour of the night;

24. and animals to stand by, so that setting Paul on, they may bring him to Felix the governor.

25.  For he was writing a letter, having this form:

26. Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:

27. This man being seized by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, coming on with the soldiers I rescued him, learning that he was a Roman.

28. And being minded to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin;

29. I found him to be accused concerning questions of their law, and having no charge worthy of death or of bonds.

30. And it being revealed to me that a plot against the man was about to be executed by the Jews, I at once sent him to you, also commanding the accusers to say the things against him before you. Farewell.

31. Then indeed taking up Paul according to the thing appointed to them, the soldiers brought him through the night to Antipatris.

32. And on the morrow, allowing the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the fortress.

33. Entering into Caesarea, and giving the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.

34. And reading it , the governor asked from what province he is. And having learned that he was from Cilicia,

35. he said, I will hear you fully when your accusers arrive. And he commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod.  

## Acts 24

1. And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.

2. And Tertullus being called, he began to accuse, saying,

3. Obtaining much peace through you and excellent accomplishments having come to this nation due to your forethought, in everything and everywhere we accept with all thankfulness, most excellent Felix.

4. But that I not hinder you more, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your fairness.

5. For finding this man pestilent and moving insurrection among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the Nazarene sect;

6. who also attempted to profane the temple, whom we also seized and wished to judge according to our law;

7. but Lysias the chiliarch coming up with much force took him away out of our hands,

8. commanding his accusers to come to you, from whom you will be able yourself to know, having examined as to all these things of which we accuse him.

9. And the Jews also joined in, alleging these things to be so.   

10. But the governor signaling to him to speak, Paul answered: Understanding you as being a judge to this nation many years, I cheerfully defend myself as to the things concerning myself.

11. You are able to know that not more than twelve days are to me since I went worshiping in Jerusalem;

12. and neither did they find me reasoning with anyone in the temple, or making a gathering of a crowd, neither in the synagogues, nor throughout the city;

13. nor are they able to prove that concerning which they now accuse me.

14. But I confess this to you that according to the Way, which they say is a sect, so I worship the ancestral God believing all things according to that having been written in the Law and the Prophets,

15. having hope toward God, which these themselves also admit, of a resurrection being about to be of the dead, both of just and unjust ones.

16. And in this I exercise myself to have always a blameless conscience toward God and men.

17. And after many years I arrived doing alms and offerings to my nation,

18. among which they found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor with tumult, but by some Jews from Asia,

19. who ought to be present before you and to accuse if they have anything against me.

20. Or these themselves say if they found anything unjust in me, I standing before the sanhedrin,

21. than concerning this one voice which I cried out standing among them, that I am being judged today before you concerning a resurrection of the dead.   

22. And hearing these things, Felix put them off, knowing more accurately about the Way, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch comes down, I will examine the things as to you.

23. And having ordered the centurion to keep Paul, and to have ease, and not to forbid anyone of his own to minister or to come to him, he dismissed them .

24. And after some days, Felix having arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul. And he heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

25. And Paul having reasoned concerning righteousness and self control, and the Judgment that is about to be, becoming afraid, Felix answered, For the present, go; but taking time later, I will call for you;

26. and with it all also hoping that silver would be given to him by Paul, that he might free him. Because of this he also more frequently sent for him and conversed with him.

27. But two years being completed, Felix welcomed a successor, Porcius Festus. And wishing to show a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.  

## Acts 25

1. Then entering the province, after three days Festus went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.

2. And the high priest and the chief of the Jews made a statement before him against Paul, and they begged him,

3. asking a favor against him, so as he might send for him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on the way.

4. Then indeed Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, he himself even being about to go shortly.

5. Then he said, those having power among you may go down with me . If there is a thing amiss in this man, let them accuse him.

6. And remaining among them more than ten days, going down to Caesarea, on the morrow sitting on the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought.

7. And he having arrived, the Jews coming down from Jerusalem stood around, also bringing many weighty charges against Paul, which they were not able to prove.

8. Defending himself, Paul said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything.

9. But desiring to show a favor to the Jews, answering Paul, Festus said, Do you desire to go up to Jerusalem to be judged before me there about these things?

10. But Paul said, I am standing before the tribunal of Caesar where I ought to be judged. I did nothing to the Jews, as also you very well know.

11. For if I indeed do wrong and have done anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing of which they accuse me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.

12. Then conferring with the sanhedrin, Festus answered, You have appealed to Caesar; you shall go before Caesar.   

13. And some days having passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, greeting Festus.

14. And when they stayed there more days, Festus set out to the king the things as to Paul, saying, A certain man has been left a prisoner by Felix,

15. about whom, on my being in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews made a statement, asking judgment against him;

16. to whom I answered, It is not a custom with Romans to give up any man to destruction before the one being accused may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of defense concerning the charge.

17. Then they coming together here, making no delay, sitting on the tribunal on the next day , I commanded the man to be brought;

18. about whom, standing up, the accusers brought no charge of which I suspected,

19. but they had certain questions about their own demon worship, and about a certain Jesus dying, whom Paul claimed to live.

20. And being puzzled as to this inquiry, I said, Did he desire to go to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things?

21. But Paul having appealed for himself to be kept to the examination of Augustus, I commanded him to be held until I might send him to Caesar.

22. And Agrippa said to Festus, I also was myself minded to hear the man. And he said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.

23. Then on the morrow, Agrippa and Bernice coming with much pomp and entering into the auditorium, with both the chiliarchs and the chief men, being of the city, also Festus commanding, Paul was led out.

24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those men present with us, you see this one about whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both here and in Jerusalem, crying out that he ought to live no longer.

25. But I having perceived nothing he had done worthy of death, also this one himself having appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him;

26. about whom I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Because of this I brought him before you, and most of all before you, king Agrippa, so as the examination taking place, I may have somewhat to write.

27. For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner, and not also to signify the charges against him.  

## Acts 26

1. And Agrippa said to Paul, It is allowed for you yourself to speak. Then Paul made a defense, stretching out the hand:

2. Concerning all of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I count myself happy being about to make defense before you today,

3. you being most of all expert, knowing of all the customs and questions also among the Jews. Because of this, I beg you patiently to hear me.

4. Truly, then, all the Jews know my way of life from youth, which from the beginning had been in my nation in Jerusalem,

5. who before knew me from the first, if they will testify, that according to the most exact sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now for the hope of the promise having been made by God to the fathers, I stand being judged;

7. to which our twelve tribes hope to arrive, worshiping in earnestness night and day, concerning which hope I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa.

8. Why is it judged unbelievable by you if God raises the dead?

9. Indeed, I then thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene.

10. Which I also did in Jerusalem, I also shut up many of the saints in prisons, receiving authority from the chief priests; and they being put to death, I cast a vote.

11. And often punishing them through all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme. And being exceedingly furious against them, I even persecuted as far as the outside cities.   

12. In which also traveling to Damascus with authority and decision power from the chief priests,

13. at midday along the highway, O king, I and those with me saw a light from heaven shining around me above the brightness of the sun.

14. And all of us falling to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the prods.

15. And I said, Who are you, Sir? And He said, I am Jesus whom you persecute;

16. but rise up and stand on your feet, for it is for this reason I appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and a witness both of what you saw, and in what I shall appear to you,

17. having delivered you from the people and the nations, to whom I now send you,

18. to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, in order that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among those being sanctified by faith in Me.

19. Upon this, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,

20. but to those first in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judea, and to the nations, I announced the command to repent and to turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.

21. Because of these things, having seized me in the temple, the Jews tried to kill me .

22. Then obtaining help from God, I stand until this day, witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing else than what the prophets and Moses also said was going to happen:

23.  that Christ was to suffer, that by a resurrection of the dead He was first going to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.   

24. And he defending himself with these things, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, You rave! Your many letters turned you into madness.

25. But he said, Not to madness, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and sanity.

26. For the king understands about these things, to whom I speak, even being bold of speech. For I am persuaded not any of these things are hidden from him, nothing. For the doing of this is not in a corner.

27. Do you believe the prophets, king Agrippa? I know that you believe.

28. And Agrippa said to Paul, Do you persuade me to become a Christian in but a little?

29. And Paul said, I would pray to God, both in a little and in much, not only you, but also these hearing me today to become as I also am, except for these bonds.

30. And he saying these things, the king and the governor and Bernice rose up, and those who sat with them.

31. And withdrawing, they spoke to one another saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

32. And Agrippa said to Festus, This man was able to have been let go, if he had not appealed to Caesar.  

## Acts 27

1. And when it was decided for us to sail to Italy, they delivered up both Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of a cohort of Augustus.

2. And boarding a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail alongside Asian places, we set sail, Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us.

3. And on the next day we landed at Sidon. And treating Paul kindly, Julius allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.

4. And setting sail from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary.

5. And sailing over the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.

6. And the centurion finding there an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, he put us into it.

7. And in many days, sailing slowly and with difficulty, hardly coming against Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed close to Crete against Salmone.

8. And coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place named Fair Havens, near to which was a city, Lasea.

9. And much time having passed, and the voyage already being dangerous, because the Fast already had gone by, Paul warned them ,

10. saying, Men, I see that the voyage is about to be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but also of our souls.

11. But the centurion was rather persuaded by the helmsman and the ship master, than by the things spoken by Paul.   

12. And the port not being fit for wintering, the most gave counsel to set sail from there, if somehow they may be able to pass the winter, arriving at Phoenix, a port of Crete looking toward the southwest and toward the northwest.

13. And a south wind blowing gently, thinking to have gained the purpose, raising anchor they sailed along close by Crete.

14. And not much after, a stormy wind being called Euroclydon beat down on it.

15. And the ship being seized, and not being able to beat against the wind, giving way we were borne along.

16. But running under an islet being called Clauda, we were hardly able to get mastery of the boat;

17. which taking, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they fall into Syrtis, lowering the tackle, so they were borne along.

18. But we having been exceedingly storm tossed, they made a casting on the next day .

19. And on the third day they threw out the ship's tackle with their hands.

20. And neither sun nor stars appearing over many days, and no small tempest pressing hard, now all hope of our being saved was taken away.   

21. And there being much fasting, then standing up in their midst, Paul said, Truly, O men, being obedient to me you ought not to have set sail from Crete, and to have come by this injury and loss.

22. And now I exhort you to be cheered, for there will be no casting away of soul from among you, only of the ship.

23. For tonight stood by me an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,

24. saying, Do not fear, Paul, You must stand before Caesar. And, behold, God has granted to you all those sailing with you.

25. Therefore, be cheered, men, for I believe God, that it will be so according to the way it was spoken to me.

26. But we must fall on a certain island.

27. And when the fourteenth night came, we being carried about in the Adriatic Sea, toward the middle of the night the sailors supposed us to come near some country.

28. And sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and moving a little and sounding again, they found fifteen fathoms.

29. And fearing lest they should fall on rock places, and casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished day to come.

30. But the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, pretending to be about to cast out anchors from the prow,

31. Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Unless these remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall.

33. And until day was about to come, Paul begged all to partake of food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day you continued waiting without food, not having taken anything.

34. Because of this I beg you to take of food, for this is to your deliverance, for not a hair of your head shall perish.

35. And saying these things, and taking bread, he gave thanks to God before all; and breaking, he began to eat.

36. And all having become cheered, they also took food.

37. And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred seventy six.

38. And being filled with food, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat out into the sea.

39. And when day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noted a certain bay having a shore, into which they purposed, if they were able, to drive the ship.

40. And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the bands of the rudders, and raising the foresail to the breeze, they held to the shore.

41. And coming on a place between two seas, they drove the vessel. And indeed the prow having stuck firmly, it remained. But the stern was broken by the violence of the waves.

42. And the mind of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any swimming out should escape.

43. But being minded to save Paul, the centurion kept them back from their purpose and commanded those able to swim, first casting themselves overboard, to go out on the land.

44. And the rest went , some indeed on boards, and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were saved on the land.  

## Acts 28

1. And being saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita.

2. And the foreigners were showing not the common kindness to us, for having kindled a fire because of the rain coming on, and because of the cold, they welcomed us all.

3. And Paul gathering a bunch of sticks, and putting them on the fire, a snake coming out from the heat fastened on his hand.

4. And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, By all means this man is a murderer, whom being saved out of the sea, Justice did not permit to live.

5. Then he indeed shaking the beast off into the fire, he suffered no harm.

6. But they expected him to be about to become inflamed, or suddenly to fall down dead. But over much time , they expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, changing their minds, they said him to be a god.

7. And in the parts about that place were lands to the chief of the island, Publius by name. Welcoming us, he housed us three days in a friendly way.

8. And it happened the father of Publius was lying down, suffering from fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul, entering and praying, laying on his hands, cured him.

9. Then, this taking place, the rest who were having infirmities in the island also came up, and they were healed.

10.  They also honored us with many honors. And on our setting sail, they lay on us such things as were needed.   

11. And after three months we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian with an ensign, Twin Brothers.

12. And landing at Syracuse, we remained three days.

13. Going around from there, we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day, a south wind having come on, on the second we came to Puteoli,

14. where finding brothers, we were begged by them to remain seven days. And so we went toward Rome.

15. And the brothers from there hearing about us, they came out to meet us, as far as the marketplace of Appius, and Three Taverns; whom Paul seeing, thanking God, he took courage.

16. And when we went into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the camp commander. But Paul was allowed to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him.   

17. And after three days, it happened that Paul called together those being chief of the Jews. And they coming together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I did nothing contrary to the people, or to the ancestral customs. I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,

18. who examining me were of a mind to let me go, because no cause of death was in me.

19. But the Jews speaking against it , I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation.

20. On account of this, then, I called for you, to see and to speak to you . For I have this chain around me for the sake of the hope of Israel.

21. And they said to him, We neither received letters concerning you from the Jews, nor having arrived has any one of the brothers reported or spoken anything evil concerning you.

22. But we think it fitting to hear from you as to what you think, for truly as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.   

23. And having appointed him a day, more came to him in the lodging, to whom he expounded, earnestly testifying the kingdom of God and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning until evening.

24. And some indeed were persuaded by that being said, others disbelieved.

25. And disagreeing with one another, they were let go, Paul saying one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through the prophet Isaiah to our fathers,

26. saying, "Go to this people and say, You will surely hear, and not at all understand; and you will surely see, and not at all perceive;

27. for the heart of this people was fattened, and they have heard with the ears heavily; and they closed their eyes lest at any time they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them." Isa. 6:9, 10

28. Then let it be known to you that the salvation of God was sent to the nations, and they will hear. LXX-Psa. 66:3; MT-Psa. 67:2

29. And he saying these things, the Jews went away, having much discussion among themselves.   

30. And Paul remained two whole years in his own rented place, and he welcomed all those coming in to him,

31. proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all freedom and without hindrance.
