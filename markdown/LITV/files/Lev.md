30. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood on the altar, and sprinkled on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him. And he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.   

31. And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and you shall eat it there, and the bread in the basket of the consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

32. And the rest of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire;

33. and you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation for seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled. For He shall consecrate you seven days;

34. as He has done on this day, Jehovah has commanded you to do, to make atonement for you.

35. And you shall remain at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night for seven days, and you shall keep the charge of Jehovah and shall not die; for so I have been commanded.

36. And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.  

## Leviticus 9

1. And it happened, on the eighth day, Moses called for Aaron and for his sons, and for the elders of Israel.

2. And he said to Aaron, Take a calf to yourself, a son of the herd, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, perfect ones, and bring near before Jehovah.

3. And speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Take a kid of the goats for a sin offering, and a calf, and a lamb, sons of a year, perfect ones, for a burnt offering;

4. and a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a food offering mixed with oil; for today Jehovah will appear to you.

5. And they took that which Moses had commanded to the front of the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.

6. And Moses said, This is the thing that Jehovah has commanded; do it , and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.

7. And Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar and make your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people, and make the offering of the people, and atone for them, as Jehovah has commanded.   

8. And Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which is for himself;

9. and Aaron's sons brought the blood near to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar. And he poured out the blood at the base of the altar;

10. and the fat, and the kidneys, and the fold of the liver, of the sin offering, he burned with incense on the altar, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

11. And he burned the flesh and the skin with fire, at the outside of the camp.

12. And he killed the burnt offering. And Aaron's sons presented the blood to him and he sprinkled it on the altar all around;

13. and they presented to him the burnt offering, by its pieces, and the head, and he burned them with incense on the altar.

14. And he washed the inward parts and the legs, and burned them as incense for the burnt offering on the altar.

15. And he brought the offering of the people, and took the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and killed it, and made it a sin offering like the first.

16. And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it, according to the ordinance.

17. And he brought the food offering and filled his palm from it, and burned it as incense on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.

18. And he killed the bullock and the ram, a sacrifice of the peace offerings, which are for the people, and Aaron's sons presented the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar all around;

19. and the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the fat tail, and the covering, and the kidneys, and the fold above the liver.

20. And they set the fat on the breasts, and he burned as incense the fat on the altar.

21. And Aaron waved the breasts, and the right leg as a wave offering before Jehovah, as Moses commanded

22. And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.   

23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation. And they came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.

24. And fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. And all the people saw, and cried aloud, and fell on their faces.  

## Leviticus 10

1. And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in them; and they put incense on it and brought strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them.

2. And fire went out from before Jehovah and consumed them; and they died before Jehovah.   

3. And Moses said to Aaron, It is that which Jehovah has spoken, saying, I will be sanctified by those drawing near to Me; and I will be honored before all the people. And Aaron was silent.

4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp.

5. And they came near and carried them in their coats to the outside of the camp, as Moses had commanded.

6. And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar, his sons, You shall not uncover your heads and you shall not tear your garments, that you may not die, and He be angry on all the congregation. As to your brothers, the whole house of Israel, they shall mourn the burning which Jehovah has kindled.

7. And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest you die. For the anointing oil of Jehovah is on you. And they did according to the word of Moses.   

8. And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying,

9. You shall not drink wine and strong drink, you nor your sons with you, as you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, and you shall not die; a never ending statute throughout your generations;

10. and to make a distinction between the holy and profane, and between the unclean and the clean;

11. and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.   

12. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the food offering that remains from the fire offerings of Jehovah, and eat it unleavened near the altar, for it is most holy.

13. And you shall eat it in the holy place, for it is your portion, and the portion of your sons, from the fire offerings of Jehovah; for so I have been commanded.

14. And the breast of the wave offering, and the leg of the heave offering, you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons, and your daughters with you. For they have been given for your portion and the portion of your sons out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the sons of Israel.

15. The leg of the heave offering, and the breast of the wave offering, besides fire offerings of the fat, they shall bring in to wave a wave offering before Jehovah; and it shall be to you, and to your sons with you, a never ending statute, as Jehovah has commanded.

16. And Moses sought carefully for the goat of the sin offering; and, behold, it had been burned! And he was angry against Eleazar and against Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, saying,

17. Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, for it is most holy, and He has given it to you to take away the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?

18. Behold, its blood has not been brought into the holy place inside. You should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I have commanded.

19. And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, today they have brought their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah; and such things have happened to me. And if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the sight of Jehovah?

20. And when Moses heard, then it was good in his eyes.  

## Leviticus 11

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, These are the living things which you shall eat out of all the animals which are on the earth.

3. Any that divides the hoof and is wholly clovenfooted, bringing up the cud, among the living things, you may eat it.

4. Only, you may not eat these, of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the hoof: the camel, though it brings up the cud, yet it does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you;

5. and the rock badger, though it brings up the cud, yet it does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you;

6. and the hare, though it brings up the cud, yet it does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you;

7. and the swine, though it divides the hoof and is clovenfooted, yet it does not bring up the cud; it is unclean to you.

8. You shall not eat of their flesh, and you shall not touch their dead body; they are unclean to you.   

9.  Of all that are in the waters, you shall eat these; any one that has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the torrents, you may eat them.

10. But any one that does not have fins and scales in the seas, and in the torrents, of any swarming creature of the waters, and of any creature which lives in the waters; they are to be detested by you.

11. Yes, they shall be detested by you; you shall not eat of their flesh and you shall shun their dead bodies.

12. Any one that does not have fins and scales in the waters, it shall be an unclean thing to you.

13. And these you shall count unclean among the fowls; they shall not be eaten; they are unclean: the eagle, and the black vulture and the bearded vulture,

14. and the kite, and the falcon, according to its kind;

15. every raven according to its kind;

16. and the ostrich, and the great owl, and the gull, and small hawks, according to its kind

17. and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the eared owl;

18. and the barn owl, and the pelican and the owl-vulture;

19. and the stork, the heron according to its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.   

20. Every flying swarming creature going on all four, it is an abomination to you.

21. Only, this you may eat of any swarming thing which flies, which goes on all four, which has legs above its feet, to leap with them on the earth;

22. these are those you may eat: the locusts according to its kind, and the bald locust according to its kind, and the long horned locust according to its kind, and the short horned grasshopper according to its kind.

23. But every swarming thing which flies, which has four feet, it is unclean to you.

24. And by these you shall be made unclean; any who touches their dead body is unclean until the evening.

25. And anyone who lifts up their dead body shall wash his garments and shall be unclean until the evening;

26. even every living thing which divides the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, and does not bring up the cud, they are unclean to you; anyone who touches them shall be unclean.

27. And any going on its paws among all the living things which go on all four, they are unclean to you; anyone who touches their dead body is unclean until the evening;

28. and he who lifts up their dead body shall wash his garments and shall be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.

29. And these shall be unclean to you among the swarming things which swarm on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard according to its kind,

30. and the gecko, and the monitor, and the lizard, and the sand lizard, and the barn owl.

31. These are unclean to you among all which swarm; anyone who touches them in their death is unclean until the evening.

32. And anything on which any one of them falls in their death is unclean, whether of any vessel of wood, or garment, or skin, or sack; any vessel in which work is done shall be caused to go into water, and shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be cleaned.

33. Ad any earthen vessel into the midst of which any one of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and you shall break it.

34. And of all the food which may be eaten, that on which such water falls shall be unclean, and all drink that may be drunk in any such vessel shall be unclean.

35. And anything on which any part of their dead body falls shall be unclean; an oven or hearth shall be broken down; they are unclean; yes, they are unclean to you.

36. But a fountain or a well, a collection of water, shall be clean; only that touching the dead body is unclean.

37. And when any part of their dead body falls on any sowing seed which is sown, it shall be clean;

38. but when water is put on the seed, and any of its dead body has fallen on it, it shall be unclean to you.

39. And when any of the animals which are food for you dies, he who touches its dead body is unclean until the evening;

40. and he who eats of its dead body shall wash his garments and shall be unclean until the evening; and he who lifts up its dead body shall wash his garments and shall be unclean until the evening.

41. And every swarming thing which swarms on the earth is unclean; it shall not be eaten;

42. Anything going on its belly, and any going on all four, and all having many feet, even every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are unclean;   

43. you shall not pollute yourselves with any swarming thing which swarms, nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, so that you should be defiled by them.

44. For I am Jehovah your God, and you have sanctified yourselves, and you have become holy, for I am holy. And you shall not defile your persons with any swarming thing which creeps on the earth;

45. for I am Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to become your God; and you shall be holy, for I am holy.

46. This is the law of the animals, and of the fowl, and of every living creature which moves in the waters, and every creature which swarms on the earth,

47. to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.  

## Leviticus 12

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman has conceived seed, and has borne a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as on the days of her menstrual impurity she shall be unclean.

3. And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

4. And she shall remain in the blood of her cleansing thirty three days; she shall not touch any holy thing, and she shall not go into the sanctuary, until the days of her cleansing are fulfilled.

5. And if she bears a female, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall continue in the blood of her cleansing sixty six days.   

6. And when the days of her cleansing are fulfilled for son or for daughter, she shall bring in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt offering, and a young dove or a turtledove for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest.

7. And he shall bring it near before Jehovah, and shall atone for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who bears, whether a male or a female.

8. And if her hand is not able to find a lamb, then she shall take two turtle doves, or two young doves one for a burnt offering, and one for a sin offering, and the priest shall atone for her; and she shall be cleansed.  

## Leviticus 13

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. When a man has a rising in the skin of his flesh, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it shall become in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought in to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.

3. And the priest shall look upon the plague in the skin of the flesh; and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy, and the priest shall look upon him and shall pronounce him unclean.

4. And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the plague seven days.

5. And he priest shall look on him on the seventh day, and, behold, if the plague stays in its appearance, and the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven more days.

6. And the priest shall look upon him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague has become dim, and the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab, and he shall wash his garments and shall be clean.

7. But if the scab spreads greatly in the skin, after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, then he shall be seen a second time by the priest.

8. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab has spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.

9. When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought in to the priest.

10. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if a white rising is in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and a living flesh is in the swelling,

11. it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.

12. And if the leprosy breaks out greatly on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the plague, from his head even to his feet, to all that appears to the priest's eyes,

13. then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plagued one clean; it has all turned white; he is clean.

14. And in the day living flesh is seen in him, he is unclean.

15. And the priest shall look on the living flesh and shall pronounce him unclean; the living flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.

16. Or when the living flesh turns back and shall be turned to white, then he shall come in to the priest;

17. and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, the plague has turned to white; the priest shall pronounce the plagued one clean; he is clean.   

18. And when the flesh has a boil in its skin, and it has been healed,

19. and a white rising has replaced the boil, or a bright white spot, very red, a reddish white, then it shall be looked upon by the priest.

20. And the priest shall look; and, behold, if its appearance is lower than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy; it has broken out in a boil.

21. But if the priest looks at it,; and, behold, there is no white hair in it, and it is not lower than the skin, and has become dim, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.

22. And if it spreads greatly in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a plague.

23. And if in its place the bright spot is stayed, it has not spread; it is an inflamed boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

24. Or if there is flesh in which the skin has a hot burning, and the raw flesh of the burning becomes a bright white spot, being very red or white;

25. and the priest shall look on it; and, behold, the hair has turned white in the bright spot, and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. It has broken out in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.

26. But if the priest looks on it, and, behold, there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is no lower than the other skin, but is somewhat faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.

27. And the priest shall look at him the seventh day. And if it is spread abroad very much in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy.

28. And if the bright spot stays in its place, and does not spread in the skin, but is somewhat faded, it is a swelling of the burning; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. for it is a scar of the burning.

29. And if a man or a woman has in them a plague in the head or in the beard,

30. then the priest shall look on the plague. And, behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and a thin shining hair in it, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scab, a leprosy on the head or beard.

31. And when the priest looks on the plague of the scab; and, behold, it is not in sight deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the plagued one with the scab seven days.

32. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague. And, behold, if the scab has not spread, and there is no shining hair in it, and the appearance of the scab is not deeper than the skin,

33. then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scab. And the priest shall shut up the one who has the scab a second seven days.

34. And the priest shall look on the scab on the seventh day. And, behold, if the scab has not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his garments, and shall be clean.

35. And if the scab has spread further in the skin after his cleansing,

36. and the priest has looked on him; and, behold, the scab has spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the shining, yellow hair; he is unclean.

37. But if in his eyes the scab has stabilized, and black hair has sprung up in it, the scab has been healed; he is clean. And the priest shall pronounce him clean.   

38. And when a man or a woman has bright spots, white bright spots, in the skin of their flesh,

39. and the priest has seen it; and, behold there are pale white spots in the skin of their flesh, it is a pale spot springing up in the skin; he is clean.

40. And when a man's head grows bald, he is bald, he is clean.

41. And if his head grows bald from the corner of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald; he is clean.

42. And if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish white plague, it is a leprosy breaking out in the bald head, or in the bald forehead.

43. And the priest shall look on him, and, behold, if the rising of the plague is reddish white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy, in the skin of the flesh,

44. he is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

45. And the leper who has the plague in him, his garments shall be torn, and his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover the upper lip; and he shall call out, Unclean! Unclean!

46. And the days that the plague shall be in him, he is unclean; he shall live alone, he is unclean; his dwelling shall be at the outside of the camp.   

47. And if there is in any garment a plague of leprosy, in a garment of wool, or in a garment of linen,

48. or in the warp, or in the woof, or of linen, or of wool, or in leather, or in any work of leather,

49. and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the leather, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of leather, it is a plague of leprosy; and it shall be shown to the priest.

50. And the priest shall look on the plague, and shall shut up the plagued thing seven days.

51. And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day. And if the plague has spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the leather, of all that is made of skin for use, the plague is a corroding leprosy; it  is unclean.

52. And he shall burn the garment, or the warp, or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, in which the plague is; for it is a corroding leprosy; it shall be burned with fire.

53. And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague has not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of leather,

54. then the priest shall command, and they shall wash that in which the plague is. And he shall shut it up a second seven days.

55. And the priest shall look on that in which the plague is after it has been washed. And, behold, if the plague has not changed its appearance, and if the plague has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it with fire; it is eaten away in its inside or in its outside.

56. And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague has become pale after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the leather, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.

57. And if it is still seen in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of leather, it is a spreading plague ; you shall burn it with fire, that in which the plague is .

58. And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or anything of leather which you shall wash when the plague has been taken off them, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.

59. This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen, or of the warp, or of the woof, or of anything of leather, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.  

## Leviticus 14

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing, that he shall be brought to the priest.

3. And the priest shall go out to the outside of the camp. And the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper,

4. then the priest shall command, and he shall take for him who is to be cleansed two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.

5. And the priest shall command, and he shall kill the one bird on an earthen vessel, over running water;

6. he shall take the living bird, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the slain bird, over the running water.

7. And he shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean. And he shall send out the living bird into the open field.

8. And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his garments, and shall shave all his hair, and shall bathe with water, and shall be clean. And afterwards he shall come into the camp, and shall live on the outside of his tent seven days.

9. And it shall be on the seventh day, he shall shave all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows; he shall even shave all his hair. And he shall wash his garments, and shall bathe his flesh with water, and shall be clean.   

10. And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe lamb, daughter of a year, a perfect one, and three tenth parts of flour for a food offering, mixed with oil, and one log of oil.

11. And the priest who is cleansing, and the man who is to be cleansed, shall stand with them before Jehovah, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

12. And the priest shall take the one male lamb and shall bring it near for a guilt offering, and the log of oil, and shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.

13. And he shall kill the lamb in the place where he killed the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place. For like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy.

14. And the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt offering; and the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

15. And the priest shall take of the log of oil and shall pour on the left palm of the priest.

16. And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil on his left palm and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.

17. And of the rest of the oil on his palm, the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering;

18. and the rest of the oil on the palm of the priest, he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed. And the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.

19. And the priest shall make a sin offering, and shall atone for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterwards he shall slaughter the burnt offering;

20. and the priest shall offer the burnt offering, and the food offering, on the altar; and the priest shall make atonement for him; and he shall be clean.   

21. And if he is poor, and his hand is not able to reach these things , then he shall take one lamb as a guilt offering, for a wave offering, to atone for himself, and one tenth part of flour mixed with oil for a food offering, and a log of oil,

22. and two turtledoves, or two young doves, which his hand can reach; and one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.

23. And he shall bring them in to the priest on the eighth day for his cleansing, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before Jehovah.

24. And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah;

25. and he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the guilt offering, and he shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

26. And the priest shall pour the oil on the left palm of the priest;

27. and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger of the oil on his palm, seven times before Jehovah.

28. And the priest shall put of the oil on his palm on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering.

29. And the rest of the oil on the priest's palm he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to atone for him, before Jehovah.

30. And he shall offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young doves, from that which he is able to reach;

31. that which his hand has reached out to, the one a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering, besides the food offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Jehovah.

32. This is the law of him in whom is a plague of leprosy whose hand could not reach to his cleansing.   

33. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

34. When you come into the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you for a possession, and I have put a plague of leprosy in the house in the land of your possession;

35. Then if he who owns the house shall come in and declare to the priest, saying, I have seen a plague in the house.

36. And the priest shall command, and they shall turn out the house before the priest comes in to see the plague that all in the house may not be unclean; and afterwards the priest shall come in to see the house.

37. And he shall look upon the plague; and, behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with depressions greenish or reddish, and the appearance of it is lower than the wall;

38. Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.

39. And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague has spread in the walls of the house;

40. Then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is , and throw them into an unclean place outside the city.

41. And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside all around, and they shall pour out the dust which they have scraped off at the outside of the city, at an unclean place.

42. And they shall take other stones and bring them in to the place of the stones; and he shall take other clay and shall plaster the house.

43. And if the plague returns and breaks out in the house after he has taken away the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it has been plastered,

44. then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a corroding leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

45. And he shall break down the house; its stones, and its wood, and all the clay of the house; and he shall carry out to the outside of the city, to an unclean place.

46. And he who goes into the house all the days he has shut it up shall be unclean until the evening.

47. And he who lies in the house shall wash his clothes and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

48. And if the priest shall come in and carefully look, and, behold, the plague has not spread in the house after the house has been plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean; for the plague has been healed.

49. And he shall take two birds for the cleansing of the house, and cedar wood, and scarlet dye , and hyssop;

50. and he shall kill the one bird on an earthen vessel, over running water;

51. and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and shall dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and shall sprinkle on the house seven times.

52. And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet dye ;

53. and he shall send away the living bird to the outside of the city, to the open field, and shall atone for the house; and it shall be clean.   

54. This is the law for every plague of the leprosy and for scabs;

55. and for leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

56. and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;

57. to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean; this is the law of leprosy.  

## Leviticus 15

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, to any man, When there is a discharge from his flesh; it is unclean because of his discharge.

3. And this is his uncleanness in his discharge, if his flesh has run with his discharge, or his flesh has ceased from his discharge; it is his uncleanness.

4. Every bed on which the one discharging lies shall be unclean. And every thing on which he sits shall be unclean.

5. And anyone who touches his bed shall wash his garments, and shall bathe with water, and shall be unclean until the evening.

6. And he who sits on a thing on which he who discharges sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.

7. And he that touches the flesh of him who discharges shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until evening.

9. And every saddle on which he who discharges rides shall be unclean.

10. And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And the one carrying those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

12. And the earthen vessel that he who discharges touches shall be broken; and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water.

13. And when he who discharges is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes. And he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

14. And on the eighth day he shall take to himself two turtle doves, or two young doves, and come before Jehovah to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and give them to the priest.

15. And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. And the priest shall atone for him before Jehovah for his discharge.

16. And if any man's semen goes out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.

25. And if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days outside the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the flow of her uncleanness, she shall be as in the days of her impurity; she is unclean.

26. Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her as the bed of her impurity to her; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her impurity.

27. And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

28. And if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

29. And on the eighth day she shall take to herself two turtledoves, or two young doves, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

30. And the priests shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall atone for her before Jehovah for the discharge of her uncleanness.

31. So you shall separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, and they shall not die in their uncleanness, when they defile My tabernacle that is in their midst.

32. This is the law of him that discharges, and of him from whom semen flows out, for uncleanness by it;

33. and of her who is menstruating in her impurity, and of him from whom the discharge flows; of a male or of a female, and of a man who lies with an unclean woman.  

## Leviticus 16

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, as they drew near before Jehovah, and they died.

2. And Jehovah said to Moses, Speak to your brother Aaron, and he shall not come in at all times to the sanctuary within the veil, to the front of the mercy-seat.

3. With this Aaron shall come into the sanctuary: with a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

4. He shall put on a holy linen coat, and linen underpants shall be on his flesh, and he shall gird himself with a linen girdle, and he shall wrap himself in a linen miter; they are holy garments. And he shall bathe his flesh with water and shall put them on.   

5. And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

6. And Aaron shall bring near the bullock of the sin offering which is his own, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house.

7. And he shall take the two goats and shall cause them to stand before Jehovah, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

8. And Aaron shall give lots over the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for a complete removal.

9. And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the lot of Jehovah fell and shall make it a sin offering.

10. And the goat on which the lot fell for a complete removal shall be made to stand living before Jehovah to atone by it, to send it away for a complete removal into the wilderness.

11. And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering which is his own, and shall atone for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is his own.

12. And he shall take a censer full of coals of the fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of fragrant perfumes beaten small, and bring it within the veil.

13. And he shall put the incense on the fire before Jehovah, and the cloud of the incense shall cover the mercy-seat on the testimony; and he shall not die.

14. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and shall sprinkle with his finger on the front of the mercy-seat eastward. And he shall sprinkle at the front of the mercy-seat seven times from the blood with his finger.   

15. And he shall kill the goat of the sin offering which is the people's, and shall bring in its blood to the inside of the veil, and shall do with its blood as he has done with the blood of the bullock, and shall sprinkle it on the mercy-seat, and at the front of the mercy-seat.

16. And he shall atone for the sanctuary because of the pollutions of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions for all their sins. And so he shall do for the tabernacle of the congregation dwelling in the midst of their pollutions.

17. And not any man shall be in the tabernacle of the congregation as he goes in to atone in the sanctuary, until he comes out. And he shall atone for himself, and for his house, and for all the congregation of Israel.

18. And he shall go out to the altar before Jehovah, and shall atone for it. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and shall put it on the horns of the altar all around.

19. And he shall sprinkle on it from the blood with his finger seven times, and shall cleanse it, and shall purify it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.   

20. And when he has finished atoning for the sanctuary, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, and has brought near the living goat;

21. then Aaron shall lay his two hands on the head of the living goat, and shall confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins, and shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send it by the hand of a chosen man into the wilderness.

22. And the goat shall bear on him all their iniquities to a land cut off. And he shall send the goat away into the wilderness.

23. And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall strip off the linen garments which he had put on as he went into the sanctuary, and shall leave them there.

24. And he shall bathe his flesh with water in the sanctuary and shall put on his garments, and shall come out, and shall offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and shall atone for himself and for his people.

25. And he shall burn as incense the fat of the sin offering on the altar.

26. And he who let the goat go for a complete removal shall wash his garments and shall bathe his flesh with water; and later he shall come into the camp.

27. And the bullock of the sin offering, and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood has been brought in to atone in the sanctuary, one shall carry out to the outside of the camp; and they shall burn their skins with fire and their flesh, and their dung.

28. And he burning them shall wash his garments, and shall bathe his flesh with water, and afterwards he shall come into the camp.   

29. And it shall be for a never ending statute, in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, you shall humble yourself and do no work, the native, and the alien who is staying in your midst.

30. For on this day he shall atone for you, to cleanse you from all your sins you shall be clean before Jehovah.

31. It is a sabbath of rest to you, and you shall humble yourself. It is a never ending statute.

32. And the priest whom He shall anoint, and whose hand He shall consecrate to act as priest instead of his father, shall make atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, the holy garments.

33. And he shall atone for the holy sanctuary, and for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar he shall atone; yes, for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation he shall atone.

34. And this shall be to you a never ending statute to atone for the sons of Israel, because of all their sins, once a year. And he did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.  

## Leviticus 17

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel. And you shall say to them, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded, saying,

3. Any man of the house of Israel who kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who kills at the outside of the camp,

4. and has not brought it in to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation as an offering to Jehovah, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood. And that man shall be cut off from the midst of his people;

5. so that the sons of Israel shall bring in their sacrifices which they are sacrificing in the open field to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings to Jehovah.

6. And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Jehovah, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall burn the fat as incense for a soothing fragrance to Jehovah.

7. And they shall not sacrifice their sacrifices any more to goats, after which they have gone whoring. This is a perpetual statute to them throughout their generations.

8. And you shall say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of aliens who sojourn in your midst, who offers burnt offering or sacrifice,

9. and does not bring it in to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it to Jehovah, that man shall be cut off from his people.   

10. And any man of the house of Israel, or of the alien who is staying in your midst, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person that eats blood and will cut him off from his people.

11. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar, to atone for your souls; for it is the blood which makes atonement for the soul.

12. For this reason I have said to the sons of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood; and the alien who is staying in your midst shall not eat blood.

13. And any man of the sons of Israel, or of the aliens who stay in your midst, who hunts game, beast or fowl, which is eaten, shall even pour out its blood and shall cover it with dust.

14. For it is the life of all flesh; its blood is for its life. And I say to the sons of Israel You shall not eat blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is in the blood; anyone eating it is cut off.

15. And any person who eats a dead body or torn thing, be he a native, or an alien, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean.

16. And if he does not wash them, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.

23. And you shall not give your semen with any animal, for uncleanness with it. And a woman shall not stand before an animal to lie down with it; it is a shameful mixing.

24. Do not defile yourself with all these, for with all these the nations have been defiled, which I am casting out before you;

25. and the land is defiled, and I will visit its iniquity on it; and the land is vomiting out its inhabitants;

26. and you, you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, and shall not do any of all these disgusting acts; neither the native nor the alien who is staying in your midst.

27. For the men of the land who are before you have done all these disgusting things, and the land is defiled.

28.  Do not do these lest the land vomit you out for your defiling it, as it has vomited out the nation that was before you.

29. For anyone who does any of these disgusting things, even the persons who are doing them , shall be cut off from the midst of their people.

8. And he who eats it, he shall bear his iniquity; for he has polluted the holy thing of Jehovah, and that person shall be cut off from his people.

9. And as you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corner of your field; and you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest;

10. and you shall not glean your vineyard, and you shall not gather the leavings of your vineyard; you shall leave them to the poor and to the alien; I am Jehovah your God.

22. And the priest shall atone for him with the ram of the guilt offering before Jehovah for his sin which he has sinned; and it shall be forgiven him because of his sin he has sinned.

23. And when you come into the land and have planted all of the food trees, then you shall expose its foreskin, its fruit, it shall be uncircumcised for you three years; it shall not be eaten.

24. And in the fourth year all its fruit is holy; it is for praises for Jehovah.

11. nor shall he come near any dead person; he shall not defile himself for his father or for his mother;

12. nor shall he go out from the sanctuary; nor shall he pollute the sanctuary of his God. For the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am Jehovah.

13. And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

14. He shall not take a widow, or one put away, or a polluted one, a harlot, but he shall take a virgin of his own people for a wife;

15. and he shall not pollute his seed among his people; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies him.   

16. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Speak to Aaron, saying, No man of your seed throughout their generations shall draw near to offer the bread of his God if there is a blemish in him.

18. For no man in whom there is a blemish shall draw near, a blind man, or one lame, or disfigured, or deformed;

19. or a brokenfooted man, or a brokenhanded man,

20. or one humpbacked, or one emaciated, or with a spot in his eye, or a scurvy one, or one scabbed, or one with crushed testicles.

21. No man of the seed of Aaron the priest in whom there is a blemish shall come near to offer the fire offerings of Jehovah; a blemish is in him; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.

22. He shall eat of the bread of his God, of the most holy things, and of the holy things.

23. But he shall not enter into the veil, and he shall not draw near to the altar; for a blemish is in him; and he shall not pollute My sanctuary; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.

24. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel.  

## Leviticus 22

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, that they set themselves apart from the holy things of the sons of Israel, and that they do not profane My holy name in what they devote to Me; I am Jehovah.

3. Say to them, Out of all your seed throughout your generations, any man who draws near to the holy things which the sons of Israel set apart to Jehovah, and his uncleanness being upon him, that person shall be cut off from before me; I am Jehovah.

4. Any man of the seed of Aaron that is leprous or has an discharge, he shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And he who touches any uncleanness of a person, or a man whose semen has gone out of him;

5. or a man who touches any swarming thing which is unclean to him, or touches a man who is unclean to him, by any of his uncleanness,

6. the person who touches it shall even be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat of the holy things, but shall bathe his flesh with water.

7. And when the sun goes in, he shall be clean, and afterwards he shall eat of the holy things, for it is his food;

8. he shall not eat a dead body or torn thing, for it is unclean; I am Jehovah.

9. And they shall keep My charge, and shall bear no sin for it, that they may not die for it when they pollute it; I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying them.   

10. And no stranger shall eat of the holy things, a tenant of a priest, or a hired servant; these shall not eat of the holy thing.

11. And if a priest buys a person, the purchase of his silver, he shall eat of it; also one born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.

12. And a priest's daughter, when she belongs to an alien man, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.

13. But a priest's daughter, when she is a widow, or put away, and has no seed, and has turned back to her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's bread. But no stranger shall eat of it.

14. And if a man shall eat of a holy thing through ignorance, then he shall add the fifth part of it, and shall give it to the priest along with the holy thing.

15. And they shall not pollute the holy things of the sons of Israel, that which they lift up to Jehovah;

16. and so cause them to bear the iniquity of the guilt offering in their eating their holy things. For I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.   

17. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the aliens in Israel, who brings near his offering, of all his vows, or of all his freewill offerings which they bring near to Jehovah for a burnt offering;

19. at your own will a male, a perfect one, of the oxen, of the sheep, or of the goats may be offered .

20. You shall not offer that which has a blemish; for it shall not be acceptable for you.

21. And when a man brings near a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah, to complete a vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; no blemish shall be in it;

22. blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a flow, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not bring these near to Jehovah; and you shall not make of them a fire offering on the altar to Jehovah.

23. As to an ox or a sheep deformed, or dwarfed, you shall make it a freewill offering; but it is not acceptable for a vow.

24. As to anything bruised, or beaten, or torn, or cut, you shall not bring it near to Jehovah; even you shall not do it in your land.

25. And you shall not bring near the bread of your God from the hand of a son of a stranger, or any of these, for their corruption is in them; they are blemished; they are not acceptable for you.

26. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

27. When an ox, or lamb, or goat is born, and when it has been seven days under its dam, then from the eighth day and onward it is acceptable for an offering, a fire offering to Jehovah;

28. but an ox or sheep, it and its young one, you shall not slaughter in one day.

29. And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, you shall sacrifice it of your free will;

30. it shall be eaten on that day; you shall not leave of it until morning; I am Jehovah.

31. And you shall keep My commandments and shall do them; I am Jehovah.

32. And you shall not profane My holy name, and I shall be counted holy among the sons of Israel; I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying you,

33. who is bringing you up out of the land of Egypt, to become your God; I am Jehovah.  

## Leviticus 23

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, The appointed feasts of Jehovah which you shall proclaim, holy gatherings, shall be these: These are My appointed seasons:

3. Work is to be done six days, and in the seventh day shall be a sabbath of rest, a holy gathering; you shall do no work; it is a sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.   

4. These are appointed seasons of Jehovah, holy gatherings which you shall proclaim in their appointed seasons:

5. In the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings is the Passover to Jehovah.

6. And on the fifteenth of this month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to Jehovah; you shall eat unleavened things seven days.

7. On the first day you shall have a holy gathering; you shall do no work of service;

8. and you shall bring near a fire offering to Jehovah seven days; and the seventh day shall be a holy gathering; you shall do no work of service.

9. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you come in to the land which I am giving to you, and have reaped its harvest, and have brought in the sheaf, or the beginning of your harvest, to the priest,

11. then he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah for your acceptance; on the morrow of the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

12. And you shall prepare a lamb in the day you wave the sheaf, a perfect one, a son of a year, for a burnt offering to Jehovah.

13. And its food offering shall be two tenth parts of flour mixed with oil, a fire offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance; and its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine.

14. And you shall not eat bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh ears, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God; it is a never ending statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings.   

15. And you shall number to you from the next day after the sabbath, from the day you bring in the sheaf of the wave offering; they shall be seven perfect sabbaths;

16. the next day after the seventh sabbath, you shall number fifty days; and you shall bring near a new food offering to Jehovah;

17. you shall bring in bread out of your dwellings for a wave offering, two loaves ; they shall be of two tenth ephah of flour; they shall be baked with leaven; firstfruits to Jehovah

18. And besides the bread, you shall offer seven lambs, perfect ones, sons of a year, and one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams; they are a burnt offering to Jehovah, with their food offering and their drink offerings, a fire offering of soothing fragrance to Jehovah.

19. And you shall offer one he-goat for a sin offering, and two lambs, sons of a year, for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

20. And the priest shall wave them, besides the bread of the firstfruits, a wave offering before Jehovah, besides the two lambs; they are holy to Jehovah for the priest.

21. And you shall make a proclamation on this same day; it is a holy gathering to you. You shall do no work of service. It is a never ending statute in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

22. And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corner of your field, nor shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor, and for the alien: I am Jehovah your God.   

23. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first of the month, you shall have a sabbath, a memorable acclamation, a holy gathering.

25. You shall do no work of service and you shall bring a fire offering to Jehovah.

26. And Jehovah spoke to Moses saying,

27. Also, on the tenth of this seventh month shall be a day of atonement; there shall be a holy gathering, and you shall humble your souls and shall bring a fire offering to Jehovah.

28. And you shall do no work in this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to atone for you before Jehovah your God.

29. For any person who is not humbled in this same day shall be cut off from his people.

30. And any person who does any work in this same day, I shall even destroy that person from the midst of his people.

31. You shall do no work; it is a never ending statute throughout your generations, in all your dwellings.

32. It is a sabbath of rest to you, and you shall humble your souls in the ninth of the month at evening; from evening until evening you shall keep your sabbath.   

33. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

34. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be a Feast of Booths seven days to Jehovah.

35. On the first day shall be a holy gathering; you shall do no work of service.

36. Seven days you shall bring a fire offering to Jehovah; on the eighth day you shall have a holy gathering; and you shall bring the fire offering to Jehovah; it is a solemn assembly; you shall do no work of service.

37. These are the set feasts of Jehovah which you shall proclaim, holy gatherings, to bring a fire offering to Jehovah, a burnt offering, and a food offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, the thing of a day on its own day;

38. besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which you shall give to Jehovah.

39. Also, in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather the increase of the land, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day a sabbath, and on the eighth day a sabbath.

40. And you shall take to yourselves on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, palm branches, and boughs of oak trees, and willows of the brook, and shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.

41. And you shall keep a feast to Jehovah, seven days in a year, a never ending statute throughout your generations; in the seventh month you shall keep it.

42. You shall live in booths seven days; all who are homeborn in Israel shall live in booths,

43. so that your generations shall know that I caused the sons of Israel to live in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.

44. And Moses announced the appointed feasts of Jehovah to the sons of Israel.  

## Leviticus 24

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, and they shall bring to you pure olive oil, beaten, for the light, to cause a light to burn continually.

3. Outside the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation Aaron shall arrange it from evening until morning before Jehovah continually, a perpetual statute throughout your generations.

4. He shall arrange the lamps on the pure lampstand before Jehovah continually.

5. And you shall take flour, and shall bake twelve cakes with it; two tenths shall be in the one cake.

6. And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row on the pure table before Jehovah.

7. And you shall put pure frankincense on the row, and it shall be the bread of a memorial, a fire offering to Jehovah.

8. On each sabbath day he shall arrange it before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel, a never ending covenant.

9. And it shall belong to Aaron and to his sons, and they shall eat it in the sanctuary, for it is most holy to him, from the fire offerings of Jehovah, a never ending statute.   

10. And the son of an Israelite woman, and a son of an Egyptian man, went out among the sons of Israel. And the son of the woman of Israel and a man of Israel struggled together in the camp.

11. And the son of the woman of Israel blasphemed the Name, and cursed. And they brought him in to Moses; and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.

12. And they put him under guard, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of Jehovah.

13. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

14. Bring out the reviler to the outside of the camp. And all those who heard shall lay their hands on his head, and all the congregation shall stone him.

15. And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When any man curses his God then he shall bear his sin.

16. And he who blasphemes the name of Jehovah shall certainly be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly cast stones at him. As to the alien, so to a native, when he blasphemes the Name, he is to be put to death.

17. And a man, when he strikes the soul from any man, he shall surely be put to death.

18. And he who smites an animal to death shall make it good, soul for soul.

19. And when a man causes a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so it shall be done to him;

20. break for break, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused a blemish in a man, so it shall be done to him.

21. And he who smites an animal to death shall repay it; and he who smites a man to death shall be put to death.

22. One judgment shall be for you whether an alien or a native; for I am Jehovah your God.

23. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the reviler to the outside of the camp and stoned him with stones. And the sons of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.  

## Leviticus 25

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses in Mount Sinai, saying.

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I am giving to you, then the land shall keep a sabbath to Jehovah.

3. You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six years, and shall gather its produce.

4. And in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath to Jehovah. You shall not sow your field, and you shall not prune your vineyard.

5. You shall not reap that which grows of itself of your harvest; and you shall not gather the grapes of your unkept vine; it shall be a year of rest to the land.

6. And the sabbath of the land shall be to you for food, to you, and to your male slave, and to you female slave, and to your hired one, and to your tenant, those living among you;

7. and to your livestock, and to the animal in your land, all its produce shall be for food.   

8. And you shall number to yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven years times seven, and all the days of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty nine years.

9. And you shall let a ram's horn resound, a signal in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month; in the day of atonement, less a ram's horn pass throughout all your land;

10. and you shall make the fiftieth year holy, a year. And you shall proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a jubilee to you. And you shall return every man to his possession; yea, you shall turn back each to his family.

11. It is a jubilee, the fiftieth year; it is a year to you. You shall not sow, nor reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from its unkept vines;

12. for it is a jubilee, it is holy to you; you shall eat its increase out of the field.

13. In the year of jubilee you shall return each one to his possession.

14. And if you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from the hand of your neighbor, you shall not each man oppress his brother.

15. By the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor; by the number of the years of increase he shall sell to you;

16. according to the many years you shall increase its price; and by the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for he is selling to you the number of crops.

17. And you shall not oppress each man his neighbor, and you shall fear your God, for I am Jehovah your God.

18. And you shall do My statutes, and you shall keep my judgments and shall do them; and you shall live on the land securely.

19. And the land shall give its fruit, and you shall eat to satisfaction; and you shall dwell securely on it.

20. And when you say, What shall we eat in the seventh year; for, lo, we may not sow nor gather our increase?

21. Then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall produce the increase for three years;

22. and you shall sow the eighth year, and shall eat of the old crop until the ninth year, until the coming in of its crop; you shall eat of the old.   

23. And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for you are aliens and tenants with Me.

24. And you shall grant a redemption for the land in all the land of your possession.

25. If your brother has become poor and has sold his possessions then his kinsman redeemer shall come, and he shall redeem the thing his brother sold.

26. But when a man has no redeemer, and his own hand has reached out, and he has enough for its redemption,

27. then he shall count the years since its sale, and shall give back the surplus to the man to whom he sold; and he shall return to his possession.

28. And if his hand has not found enough to give back to him, then the thing he sold shall be in the hand of him who buys it until the year of jubilee. And it shall go out in the jubilee, and he shall return to his possession.

29. And when a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his right of redemption shall be the end of the year of its sale; his right of redemption shall be a year of days

30. And if it is not redeemed until a full year is complete, then the house in the walled city shall be established to perpetuity to its buyer, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee.

31. But the houses of the villages which have no walls all around shall be counted as the field of the country; there are redemption rights to it. And it shall go out in the jubilee.

32. As to the cities of the Levites, houses of the cities of their possession, never ending redemption rights shall be to the Levites.

33. And that which one redeems from the Levites, both the sale of a house, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.

34. And the field, the open land of their cities, shall not be sold; for it is a never ending possession to them.

35. And when your brother has become poor, and his hand has failed with you, then you shall help him. He shall live with you as an alien and a tenant.

36. You shall take no interest from him, or increase; and you shall fear your God; and the life of your brother is with you.

37. You shall not give silver to him with interest, and you shall not give your food for increase.

38. I am Jehovah who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to become your God.   

39. And when your brother becomes poor with you, and he has been sold to you, you shall not lay on him the service of a slave.

40. He shall be with you as a hireling, as a tenant he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee;

41. then he shall go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his family; he shall even return to the possession of his father.

42. For they are My servants, whom I have brought out from the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold with the sale of a slave.

43. You shall not rule over him with severity, and you shall fear your God.

44. And your male slave and your female slave whom you have shall be from the nations who are all around you, you shall buy them as male slave or female slave;

45. and also you may buy of the sons of the tenants who are sojourning with you, and of their families who are with you, which they have fathered in your land. And they shall be a possession to you.

46. And you shall take them for inheritance to your sons after you, to hold for a possession; you may lay service on them forever. But on your brothers, the sons of Israel, one over another, you shall not rule over him with severity.

47. And if lifts up a hand of an alien or a tenant with you, and your brother grows poor with him, and he sells himself to an alien, a tenant with you, or to the offshoot of the family of an alien,

48. after he has been sold, there is a redemption to him; one of his brothers may redeem him,

49. or his uncle, or a son of his uncle, may redeem him, or any of his fleshly relations of his family may redeem him. Or, if his own hand has reached out to gain , then he may be redeemed.

50. And he shall count with his buyer from the year of his being sold to him until the year of jubilee, and the silver of his sale shall be by the number of years. As the days of a hireling, it shall be with him.

51. If there are yet many years according to them, he shall give back his redemption, from the silver of his purchase.

52. And if few are left of the years till the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him according to his years he shall give back his redemption price.

53. As a hireling, year by year, he shall be with him, and he shall not rule him with severity before your eyes.

54. And if he is not redeemed in this way, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.

55. For the sons of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.  

## Leviticus 26

1. You shall not make idols to yourselves; and you shall not set up for yourselves graven images, or a memorial pillar. And you shall not place any stone image in your land, to bow yourselves to it; for I am Jehovah your God.

2. You shall keep My sabbaths, and revere My sanctuary; I am Jehovah.

3. If you walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them,

4. then I will give you rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the tree of the field shall give its fruit;

5. and your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to satisfaction, and live in your land securely.

6. And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall terrify you. And I shall cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass over into your land.

7. And you shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.

8. And five of you shall pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you shall pursue a myriad; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

9. And I shall turn My face toward you and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and shall establish My covenant with you.

10. And you shall eat very old provision, and clear away the old because of the new.

11. And I will set My tabernacle in your midst, and My soul shall not loathe you;

12. and I shall walk always in your midst, and shall be God to you, and you, you shall be people to Me;

13. I am Jehovah your God, who has brought you out of the land of the Egyptians, from being their slaves; and I will break the bars of your yoke, and cause you to stand erect.   

14. And if you will not listen to Me, and do not do all these commands;

15. and if you reject My statutes, and if your soul hates My judgments, so as not to do all My commands, to the breaking of My covenant;

16. I will also do this to you, and I shall appoint terror over you, the wasting, and the burning fever, destroying the eyes, and consuming the soul; and you shall sow your seed in vain, and your enemies will eat it.

17. And I shall set My face against you, and you shall be smitten before your enemies; and those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee, and there will be no one pursuing you.

18. And if after these things you will not listen to Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sin;

19. and I will break the pride of your strength, and will make your heavens as iron, and your earth as bronze;

20. and your strength shall be consumed in vain, and your land shall not give her produce, and the tree of the land shall not give its fruit.

21. And if you walk contrary to Me, and are not willing to listen to Me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins,

22. and send against you the beast of the field, and it shall bereave you. And I shall cut off your livestock and shall make you few, so that your ways are desolate.

23. And if you are not chastised by Me by these things, and shall walk contrary to Me,

24. then I, I also, shall walk contrary to you, and shall smite you, even I, seven times more for your sins;

25. and I will bring a sword on you, executing the vengeance of the covenant, and you shall be gathered to your cities, and I shall send pestilence into your midst; and you shall be given into the hand of an enemy.

26. When I break to you the staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall give back your bread by weight; and you shall eat, and shall not be satisfied.

27. If you will not listen to Me for this, and shall walk contrary to Me,

28. then I also will walk contrary to you in fury. I also will chastise you, I also, seven times for your sins.

29. And you shall eat of the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat of the flesh of your daughters.

30. And I shall destroy your high places and cut down your altars, and shall put your dead bodies on the carcasses of your idols. And My soul shall loathe you.

31. And I shall make your cities a waste, and shall make your sanctuaries desolate; and I shall not smell your sweet fragrances.

32. And I shall make the land desolate, and your enemies who are living in it shall be astonished at it.

33. And I will scatter you among nations, and shall draw out the sword after you, and your land shall become a waste, and your cities shall be a desolation.

34. Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths, all the days of the desolation. And you shall be in the land of your enemies; then the land shall enjoy rest, and shall enjoy its sabbaths.

35. It shall rest all the days of the desolation, that which it has not rested in your sabbaths while you lived on it.

36. And those who are left of you, I shall also bring a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they shall fall when no one pursues.

37. And they shall stumble upon one another, as if it were before the sword, when no one pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

38. And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.

39. And of those who are left of you, they shall putrefy in their iniquity, in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers, they shall putrefy with them.   

40. And if they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass with which they have trespassed against Me; and, also, that they have walked contrary to Me,

41. I also will walk contrary to them, and I will bring them into the land of their enemies. If their uncircumcised hearts are then humbled, and they then have satisfied for their iniquity;

42. then I will remember My covenant with Jacob; and also My covenant with Isaac; and I shall also remember My covenant with Abraham, and I shall remember the land.

43. For the land shall be forsaken by them, and shall satisfy for its sabbaths, in the desolation without them. And they shall satisfy for their iniquity, because, even because, they have kicked against My judgments, and their soul has loathed My statutes.

44. And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I hate them, to consume them, to break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.

45. Then I shall remember for them the covenant of the first fathers, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God; I am Jehovah.

46. These are the statutes and the judgments and the laws which Jehovah has given between Him and the sons of Israel, in Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.  

## Leviticus 27

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When a man makes a difficult vow by your evaluation, the persons shall be Jehovah's.

3. And your evaluation shall be of the male from a son of twenty years even until a son of sixty years; then your evaluation shall be fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary.

4. And if it is a female, then your evaluation shall be thirty shekels.

5. And if from a son of five years to a son of twenty years, then your evaluation shall be twenty shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female.

6. And if a son of a month even to a son of five years, then your evaluation shall be five shekels of silver for the male and three shekels of silver for the female.

7. And if from a son of sixty years and above, if a male, then your evaluation shall be fifteen shekels and for a female ten shekels.

8. but if he is too poor for your evaluation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to the reach of him who vowed.

9. And if it is an animal of which they bring an offering to Jehovah, all that one gives of it to Jehovah is holy.

10. He shall not replace it, or change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.

11. And if any unclean animal, or one which they may not bring as an offering to Jehovah, then he shall make stand the animal before the priest.

12. And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you the priest value it, so it shall be.

13. But if he really redeems it, then he shall add its fifth to your evaluation.   

14. And when a man sanctifies his house as a holy thing to Jehovah, then the priest shall value it, whether good or bad. As the priest values it, so it shall stand.

15. And if he who is sanctifying shall redeem the house, then he shall add a fifth of the silver of its valuation, and it shall become his.

16. And if a man sanctifies a field of his property to Jehovah, then your valuation shall be according to its seed; a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.

17. If he shall sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand according to your valuation.

18. And if he shall sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall count to him the silver according to the years which are left, to the year of the jubilee. And it shall be deducted from your estimation.

19. And if he sanctifying the field really will redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the silver of your evaluation to it, and it shall rise to become his.

20. And if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it is not to be redeemed any more.

21. And the field shall be holy to Jehovah when it goes out in the jubilee, as a field which is devoted. It shall be a possession to the priest.

22. And if he should devote a field of his purchase, which is not of the fields of his possession,

23. then the priest shall count to him the amount of your valuation to the year of jubilee. And he shall give your valuation in that day, a holy thing to Jehovah.

24. In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom he bought it, to him who owns it in the land.

25. And all your valuation shall be by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.   

26. However, no man shall dedicate a firstling, which is first-born to Jehovah among animals, whether ox or sheep; it is Jehovah's.

27. And if among the unclean animals, then he shall ransom it at your valuation, and he shall add its fifth to it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold at your evaluation.

28. But any devoted thing which a man devotes to Jehovah from all which belongs to him, of man or of animal, or of the field of his possession, it shall not be sold nor redeemed. Every devoted thing to Jehovah is most holy.

29. No devoted thing which is dedicated by man shall be ransomed; it shall surely be put to death.

30. And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, shall be Jehovah's; it is holy to Jehovah.

31. And if a man really redeems any of his tithes, he shall add its fifth to it.

32. And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock, all that passes under the rod, a tenth shall be holy to Jehovah;

33. he shall not search whether it is good or bad, nor shall he change it. And if he at all changes it, then it shall be that it and its substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

34. These are the commands which Jehovah has commanded Moses for the sons of Israel, on Mount Sinai.
