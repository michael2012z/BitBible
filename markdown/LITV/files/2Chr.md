## 2 Chronicles 1

1. And Solomon the son of David made himself strong over his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and made him exceedingly great.

2. And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of the thousands, and of the hundreds, and to judges, and to every honorable one of all Israel, heads of the fathers;

3. and they went, Solomon and all the congregation with him, to the high place that in Gibeon, for there was God's tabernacle of the congregation that Moses, the servant of Jehovah, had made in the wilderness.

4. But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim, when David made ready for it, for he had stretched out a tent for it in Jerusalem;

5. and the altar of bronze that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put it before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the congregation sought to it.

6. And Solomon went up there on the bronze altar before Jehovah, that was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered on it a thousand burnt offerings.

7. In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, Ask what I shall give to you.

8. And Solomon said to God, You have acted with great kindness with my father David, and have made me king in his place.

9. Now, O Jehovah God, Your word with my father David is confirmed, for You have made me to reign over a people as many as the dust of the earth.

10. Now give to me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this Your great people?

11. And God said to Solomon, Because this has been in your heart, that you have not asked riches, treasures, and honor, and the life of those who hate you, and also have not asked many days, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may judge My people, over whom I have made you reign;

12. the wisdom and the knowledge are given to you, and riches, and treasures, and honor I will give to you, such as none of the kings who were before you has had, and after you it shall not be so.   

13. And Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place in Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.

14. And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand, four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.

15. And the king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones, and he made the cedars as sycamores that are in the low country for abundance.

16. And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and out of Kue, the king's merchants took them from Kue at a price;

17. and they came up and brought out from Egypt a chariot for six hundred silver pieces, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their hand.  

## 2 Chronicles 2

1. And Solomon said to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom;

2. And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men, bearers of burden, and eighty thousand men hewing in the mountains; and overseers over them three thousand, six hundred.

3. And Solomon sent to Hiram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt with my father David, and sent him cedars to build a house to live in, also

4. behold, I am building a house to the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate to Him, to burn incense of sweet spices before Him, and for the continual bread of arrangement, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbath, and on the new moons, and at the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This shall be upon Israel forever.

5. And the house which I am building shall be great, for our God is greater than all gods.

6. But who has strength to enclose a house for Him, since the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? And who am I that I should build Him a house, except to offer before Him?

7. And now, send to me a skilled man to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and violet, and knowing how to engrave all kinds of engravings with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom my father David has prepared.

8. And send to me cedar trees, firs, and algums from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut down the trees of Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall be with your servants,

9. even to prepare trees in abundance for me, for the house that I am building will be great and wonderful.

10. And behold, I shall give beaten wheat to the hewers, to those cutting down the trees, to your servants, twenty thousand kors of beaten wheat and twenty thousand kors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.   

11. And Hiram the king of Tyre answered in writing, and sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loves His people, He has given you as king over them.

12. And Hiram said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, knowing discretion and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.

13. And now I have sent a skilled man having understanding, of Hiram my father,

14. the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre, who knows how to work in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in wood, in purple, and violet, and in fine linen, and in crimson, and to engrave any engraving, and to invent any device that is given to him, with your skilled men, and the skilled men of my lord David, your father.

15. And now the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, as my lord said, let him send to his servants.

16. And we will cut trees out of Lebanon, according to all your need, and bring them to you by floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall take them up to Jerusalem.

17. And Solomon numbered all the men, the aliens who were in the land of Israel, according to the numbering with which his father David numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty three thousand, six hundred;

18. and he made seventy thousand of them burden bearers, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountain, and three thousand, six hundred to oversee to cause the people to work.  

## 2 Chronicles 3

1. And Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, in Mount Moriah, where He appeared to his father David, in the place that David had prepared, in the grain floor of Ornan the Jebusite;

2. And he began to build on the second, in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.

3. And these are the foundations Solomon laid , to build the house of God: the length by cubits according to the ancient measure, sixty cubits; and the breadth twenty cubits.

4. As to the porch on the front, the length, according to the breadth of the house in front, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it inside with pure gold.

5. And the greater house he covered with cypress wood, and he covered it with good gold, and caused to go on it palms and chains.

6. And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim.

7. And he covered the house, the beams, the threshold, and the walls, and its doors with gold; and engraved cherubs on the walls.

8. And he built the Most Holy Place its length was by the front, of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he covered it with fine gold, to six hundred talents;

9. and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold, and he covered the upper rooms with gold.   

10. And in the most holy house he made two cherubs of image work, and he overlaid them with gold.

11. And the wings of the cherubs, their length was twenty cubits: the wing of the one was five cubits, touching the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub;

12. and the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.

13. The wings of these cherubs spread out twenty cubits and they were standing on their feet and their faces were inward.

14. And he made the veil of violet, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and caused to go on it cherubs.

15. And at the front of the house, he made two pillars thirty five cubits high, and the capital on their tops was five cubits.

16. And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the capitals of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.

17. And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right, and one on the left, and called the name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.  

## 2 Chronicles 4

1. And he made an altar of bronze, its length twenty cubits and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height ten cubits.

2. And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from its brim to its brim, circular all around; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it all around.

3. And under it was the shape of oxen, under it and all around it for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. Two rows of oxen were cast when it was cast.

4. It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east; and the sea was upon them above, and all their hinder parts inside.

5. And its thickness was a handbreadth, and its lip like the work of the lip of a cup, like a lily blossom. It received and held three thousand baths.

6. He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; they washed what pertains to the burnt offering with them; and the sea was for the priests to wash in.

7. And he made ten lampstands of gold, according to their ordinance, and placed them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.

8. He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left; and he made a hundred basins of gold.

9. And he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court; and he overlaid their doors with bronze.

10. And he placed the sea on the right side eastward, across from the south.   

11. And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Hiram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon in the house of God:

12. the two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals on the top of the two pillars, and the two net-works to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;

13. and the pomegranates (four hundred to the two net-works, two rows of pomegranates to the one net-work) to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the face of the pillars.

14. He also made the bases; and he made lavers on the bases;

15. the one sea, and twelve oxen under it,

16. and the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their vessels did his master Hiram make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, of burnished bronze.

17. In the plain of Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

18. And Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, so that the weight of the bronze could not be searched out.

19. And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, and the golden altar, and the tables on which the Bread of the Presence rested ;

20. and the lampstands, and their lamps, for their burning was according to the ordinance, before the holy place, of refined gold;

21. and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold (it was perfect gold).

22. and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the entrance to the house, its innermost doors to the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the house to the temple, of gold.  

## 2 Chronicles 5

1. And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the dedicated things of his father David, and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he had put among the treasures of the house of God.

2. Then Solomon gathered the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, rulers of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David; it is Zion.

3. And all the men of Israel were gathered to the king in the feast; it was the seventh month.

4. And all the elders of Israel came in, and the Levites lifted up the ark,

5. and they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy utensils that were in the tabernacle; the Levitical priests brought them up.

6. And king Solomon and all the company of Israel who were assembled to him before the ark were sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.

7. And the priest brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, to the sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, to the place of the wings of the cherubs;

8. and the cherubs spread out wings over the place under the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark and its staves from above;

9. and so long were the staves, that the heads of the staves could be seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside. And there it is to this day.

10. Nothing was in the ark but the two tablets that Moses gave in Horeb, where Jehovah cut a covenant with the sons of Israel when they came out from Egypt.   

11. And it happened as the priests were going from the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves without observing divisions),

12. and the Levitical singers to all of them, to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons and to their brothers, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, and with harps and lyres, were standing on the east of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests blowing with trumpets.

13. And they were as one to the trumpeters, and to the singers to cause one sound to be heard to praise and to thank Jehovah. And when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, saying , For He is good; for his mercy endures forever; and a cloud filled the house, the house of Jehovah;

14. so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God.  

## 2 Chronicles 6

1. Then Solomon spoke, Jehovah has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.

2. And I have surely built an exalted house for You, and a place for You to dwell forever.

3. And the king turned his face and blessed all the congregation of Israel. And all the congregation of Israel was standing.

4. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has spoken with His mouth to my father David, and with His hands has fulfilled it, saying,

5. From the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of any of the tribes of Israel to build a house for My name to be there, and I have not chosen a man to be leader over My people Israel.

6. But I have chosen Jerusalem for My name to be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.

7. And it was in the heart of my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

8. And Jehovah said to my father David, Because it has been in your heart to build a house for My name, you have done well that it has been in your heart,

9. but you shall not build the house, for your son who comes forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for My name.

10. And Jehovah has lifted up His word that He spoke, for I have risen up in the place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spoke. And I have built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

11. And I have placed the ark there, where the covenant of Jehovah is , that He made with the sons of Israel.   

12. And he stood before the altar of Jehovah, before the congregation of Israel, and spread out his palms.

13. Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, and put it in the middle of the court, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high; and he stood on it, and knelt on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands toward Heaven.

14. and said, O Jehovah, God of Israel, there is no God like You in the heavens and in the earth, keeping covenant and mercy with Your servants, who walk before You with all their hearts;

15. who has kept with Your servant David, my father, that which You spoke to him; yea, You spoke with Your mouth, and You have fulfilled with Your hand, as at this day.

16. And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep with Your servant David, my father, that which You spoke to him, saying, There shall not be cut off to you a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel. Only, if your sons watch their way to walk in My law, as you have walked before Me.

17. And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, let Your word be verified, which you spoke to Your servant David.

18. For is it true that God shall dwell with men on the earth? Behold, the heavens, and the heaven of heavens, do not contain You. How much less this house that I have built!

19. And You have turned toward the prayer of Your servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer that Your servant is praying before You;

20. for Your eyes shall be open toward this house by day and by night, toward the place that You have said to put Your name there, to listen to the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place.

21. And You shall listen to the supplications of Your servant, and of Your people Israel, that they pray toward this place; and You shall hear from Your place of dwelling, from Heaven, and shall hear and forgive.

22. If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and he shall lift up an oath on him, to cause him to swear, and he shall come and swear before Your altar in this house,

23. You shall hear from Heaven, and shall act, and shall judge Your servants, to repay the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and to justify the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

24. And if Your people Israel shall be stricken before an enemy, because they have sinned against You; and they shall return and confess Your name, and shall pray and make supplication before You in this house,

25. then You shall hear from Heaven, and shall forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and shall cause them to return to the land which You have given to them and to their fathers.

26. When the heavens shall be shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they shall pray toward this place, and confess Your name, turning back from their sin because You have afflicted them,

27. then You shall hear from Heaven, and shall forgive the sin of Your servants, and of Your people Israel, because You have taught them the good way in which they should walk, and have given rain on Your land that You have given to Your people for an inheritance.

28. When there shall be famine in the land, when there is pestilence, blasting, or mildew; when there are locusts or ravagers when its enemies have distressed it in the land, in its gates, with any plague and any sickness;

29. Whatever prayer, whatever supplication shall be made for any man, and for all Your people Israel, when they know each one his own plague, and his own grief, and he shall spread out his palms toward this house;

30. then You shall hear from Heaven, Your dwelling place, and shall forgive, and shall give to each according to all his ways, because You know his heart; for You, You only, have known the heart of the sons of men;

31. so that they shall fear You, to walk in Your ways all the days that they shall live on the face of the land that You have given to our fathers.

32. And, also, to the stranger who is not of Your people Israel, and he has come from a distant land for Your great name's sake, and Your mighty hand, and Your stretched out arm; and they shall come and pray toward this house,

33. then You shall hear from Heaven, from Your dwelling place, and shall do according to all that the stranger calls to You; so that all the people of the earth shall know Your name, so as to fear You, as Your people Israel, and to know that Your name is called on this house that I have built.

34. When Your people shall go out to battle against its enemies in the way that You shall send them, and they shall pray to You toward this city that You have chosen, and the house that I have built for Your name;

35. then You shall hear from Heaven their prayer and their supplication, and shall maintain their cause.

36. When they sin against You (for there is not a man who does not sin) and You shall be angry with them and shall give them up before an enemy, and their captors shall take them captive, to a land distant or near;

37. and they shall return to their heart in the land from which they have been taken captive, and shall turn back and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have acted perversely and have done wickedly;

38. yea, they shall turn back to You with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and they shall pray toward their land that You have given to their fathers, and toward the city that You have chosen and toward the house that I have built for Your name;

39. then You shall hear from Heaven, from Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and shall maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.

40. Now, My God, I beseech You, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place;

41. and now, O Jehovah God, rise to Your rest; You, and the ark of Your strength; O Jehovah God, Your priests are clothed with salvation, and Your saints rejoice in goodness;

42. O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember the good deeds of Your servant David.  

## 2 Chronicles 7

1. And when Solomon finished praying, then the fire came down from Heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house;

2. and the priests were not able to go into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.

3. And all the sons of Israel were watching, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was on the house and they bowed their noses to the earth, on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Jehovah: for He is good, for His mercy endures forever.

4. And the king and all the people were offering a sacrifice before Jehovah;

5. and king Solomon offered the sacrifice from the herd, twenty two thousand, and from the flock, a hundred and twenty thousand; all the people dedicated the house of God.

6. And the priests were standing over their charges, and the Levites with instruments of the music to Jehovah, that David the king had made, to give thanks to Jehovah, for His mercy endures forever, when praised David by their hand; and the priests were blowing trumpets before them, and all Israel was standing.

7. And Solomon dedicated the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for he had offered there the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings; for the bronze altar that Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering, and the food offering, and the fat.

8. And Solomon at that time kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a great company, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt.

9. And they made a solemn assembly on the eighth day, because they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.

10. And on the twenty third day of the seventh month, he sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and glad of heart, for the goodness that Jehovah had done to David, and to Solomon, and to His people Israel.

11. And Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king's house; and all that came to the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he was caused to prosper.   

12. And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to Myself for a house of sacrifice.

13. If I shut up the heavens and there is no rain and if I command the locusts to consume the land, and if I send pestilence among My people,

14. and My people, on whom My name is called, shall be humbled, and shall pray, and shall seek My face, and shall turn back from their evil ways, then I will hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

15. Now My eyes shall be open, and My ears attentive to the prayer of this place;

16. and now I have chosen and sanctified this house for My name to be there forever; yea, My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.

17. And you, if you shall walk before Me as your father David walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded you, and shall keep My statutes and My judgments,

18. then I shall establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with your father David, saying, There shall not be cut off a man to you who rules in Israel;

19. and if you turn away, and you shall forsake My statutes and My commandments that I have placed before you, and shall go and serve other gods and shall bow yourselves to them,

20. then I shall pluck them up from off My land that I have given them, and this house that I have sanctified for My name I shall cast away from before My face, and I shall give it for a proverb and a byword among all the nations.

21. And this house that was on high shall be a wonder to everyone who passes by it, they shall shudder and say, Why has Jehovah done this to this land and to this house?

22. And they shall say, Because they have forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and have laid hold on other gods and have bowed themselves to them, and served them; for this He has brought on them all this evil.  

## 2 Chronicles 8

1. And it happened, at the end of twenty years, Solomon built the house of Jehovah, and his own house.

2. As to the cities that Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon had built them, and he caused the sons of Israel to live there.

3. And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and prevailed over it.

4. And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.

5. And he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the lower, as fortified cities, with walls, two leaved doors, and bars;

6. and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon that he wanted to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

7. All the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,

8. (they were of their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel had not exterminated) Solomon caused them to go for forced labor to this day.

9. And none of the sons of Israel did Solomon make slaves for his work, but they were men of war, and commanders of his officers, and commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.

10. And these were the commanders of the deputies king Solomon had, two hundred and fifty who were rulers among the people.

11. And Solomon had brought up Pharaoh's daughter from the city of David to the house that he had built for her. For he said, My wife shall not live in the house of David the king of Israel, for they are holy, to whom the ark of Jehovah has come.   

12. Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he had built before the porch,

13. even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts three times in the year, in the Feast of Unleavened Bread , and in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Booths.

14. And according to the decree of his father David, he made stand the divisions of the priests over their service, and of the Levites over their charges, to praise and to minister before the priests, according to the duty of every day, and the gatekeepers in their courses at every gate, for so was the command of David the man of God.

15. And they did not turn aside from the king's command as to the priests and the Levites in regard to any matter, and to the treasures.

16. And all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until its completion. The house of Jehovah was finished.

17. And Solomon went to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth on the seacoast, in the land of Edom.

18. And Hiram sent ships to him by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. And they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought it to king Solomon.  

## 2 Chronicles 9

1. And the queen of Sheba had heard of Solomon's fame. And she came to test Solomon with sharp questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels bearing spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones. And she came in to Solomon and spoke with him all that was in her heart.

2. And Solomon told her all her matters; and there was nothing hidden from Solomon that he did not declare to her.

3. And the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,

4. and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered up in the house of Jehovah; and there was no more spirit in her.

5. And she said to the king, The word that I heard in my land concerning your matters and concerning your wisdom is true.

6. But I had given no credit to their words, until I had come and my eyes had seen. And, behold, there was not declared to me half of the abundance of your wisdom. You exceeded the report that I heard.

7. Oh the happiness of your men, and the happiness of your servants, these who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom!

8. May Jehovah your God be blessed, who has delighted in you, to put you on His throne to be king for Jehovah your God. In the love of your God toward Israel, to make it stand forever, He has put you over them as king, to do judgment and righteousness.

9. And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great plenty, and precious stones. And there has not been any spice as that the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

10. And also the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought in gold from Ophir, brought in algum trees and precious stones.

11. And the king fashioned the algum trees into steps for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and lyres and harps for singers. and there was none like these before in the land of Judah.

12. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. And she turned and went to her land, she and her servants.   

13. And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold,

14. besides that from the traders, and that the merchants were bringing in. And all the kings of Arabia, and the rulers of the land, were bringing in gold and silver to Solomon.

15. And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold; he put six hundred of beaten gold on the one target;

16. and three hundred shields of beaten gold; he put three hundred of gold on the one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

17. And the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold;

18. and six steps were to the throne, and a footstool of gold was fastened to the throne; and hands were on this side and on that, at the place of the sitting; and two lions were standing near the hands;

19. and twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on this side and on that. There was not any such made for any kingdom.

20. And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon of refined gold. Silver was not counted for anything in the days of Solomon.

21. For the ships of the king were going to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once in three years the ships came from Tarshish bearing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

22. And king Solomon increased more than any of the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom.

23. And all the kings of the earth were seeking the face of Solomon, to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart.

24. And they were each bringing his present, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments, weapons, and spices, horses and mules, a rate year by year.

25. And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he put them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.

26. And he ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

27. And the king made silver in Jerusalem as the stones. And he made the cedars as the sycamores in the low country for abundance.

28. And they brought out horses from Egypt to Solomon, and from all the lands.

29. And the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, are they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

30. And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

31. And Solomon lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 10

1. And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.

2. And it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard, he being in Egypt because he had fled from the face of Solomon the king, Jeroboam returned from Egypt.

3. And they sent and called for him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,

4. Your father made our yoke hard; and now lighten the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke that he put on us, and we shall serve you.

5. And he said to them, Come again to me in three days; and the people left.

6. And king Rehoboam consulted with the aged men who had stood before his father Solomon when he was alive, saying, How do you advise to answer this people a word?

7. And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be good to this people, and will please them, and will speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.

8. But he left the counsel of the aged men who had advised him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, those standing before him.

9. And he said to them, What do you advise that we shall answer this people that have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke that your father put on us?

10. And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, You shall say this to the people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and you lighten our yoke, this you shall say to them, My little  finger is thicker than the loins of my father;

11. and now, my father laid a heavy yoke on you, and I will surely add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I with scorpions.   

12. And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king commanded, saying, Return to me on the third day.

13. And the king answered them sharply, and king Rehoboam left the counsel of the aged men,

14. and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will surely add to it; my father chastised you with whips, and I with scorpions.

15. And the king did not listen to the people, for the revolution was from God, so that Jehovah might establish His word that He spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

16. And all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, and the people sent back to the king, saying, What part do we have in David? Yea, there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each to your tents, O Israel! Now see to your house, David! And all Israel went to their tents.

17.  As to the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

18. And king Rehoboam sent Hadoram who was over the forced labor. And the sons of Israel threw stones at him, and he died. And king Rehoboam was alerted to mount up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem.

19. And Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.  

## 2 Chronicles 11

1. And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem and called up the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight with Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam.

2. And the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,

3. Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

4. So says Jehovah, You shall not go up, nor fight with your brothers. Each return to his house, for this thing has come from Me. And they heard the words of Jehovah, and turned back from going against Jeroboam.

5. And Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.

6. And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

7. and Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

8. and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

9. and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

10. and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron. These were in Judah and in Benjamin as cities of defense.

11. And he made the strongholds stronger, and put commanders in them, and treasures of food and oil and wine.

12. And he put in every city shields and spears, and made them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin were his.   

13. And the priests and the Levites in all Israel stationed themselves by him, out of all their territory.

14. For the Levites had abandoned their pasture land and their property. And they came to Judah and to Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them out from acting as priests to Jehovah.

15. And he made stand priests for himself for the high places, and for goats, and for the calves that he made.

16. And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those who gave their heart to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

17. And they made the kingdom of Judah stronger, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon stronger, for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.

18. And Rehoboam took a wife for himself, Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David; Abihail the daughter of Eliab, the son of Jesse.

19. And she bore to him sons: Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

20. And after her, he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom, and she bore to him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

21. And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines (for he had taken eighteen wives, and sixty concubines; and he fathered twenty eight sons and sixty daughters).

22. And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah the head, as ruler among his brothers, in order to cause him to reign.

23. And he had understanding, and spread out all his sons to all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the cities of defense, and gave them provision in abundance. And he demanded a multitude of wives.  

## 2 Chronicles 12

1. And it happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was settled, and when he was strong, he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.

2. And it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak the king of Egypt came against Jerusalem because they had acted unfaithfully against Jehovah.

3.  He came with a thousand and two hundred chariots, and with sixty thousand horsemen. And there was no counting the people who came with him out of Egypt: Lubim, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.

4. And he captured the cities of defense in Judah and came to Jerusalem.

5. And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered to Jerusalem from the face of Shishak. And he said to them, So says Jehovah, You have forsaken Me; and I also have forsaken you in the hand of Shishak.

6. And the leaders of Israel and the king were humbled. And they said, Jehovah is righteous.

7. And when Jehovah saw that they were humbled, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have been humbled. I will not destroy them, and I will give to them a little deliverance. And I will not pour out My fury on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

8. But they shall become his servants, and they shall know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.

9. And Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house. He took all, and he took the golden shields that Solomon had made.

10. And king Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and deposited them into the hand of the chiefs of the runners who kept the gate of the king's house.

11. And it happened, from the time the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners came in and lifted them up, and brought them back to the guard room.

12. And when he was humbled, the wrath of Jehovah turned away from him, so as not to destroy him completely. And also good things were found in Judah.   

13. And king Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem, and reigned. For Rehoboam was a son of forty one years when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen to put His name there, out of all the tribes of Israel. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.

14. And he did the evil, for he had not resolved in his heart to seek Jehovah.

15. And the acts of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer as to genealogy? And the wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam lasted all their days.

16. And Rehoboam lay with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And his son Abijah reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 13

1. In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.

2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

3. And Abijah joined the battle with an army of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men. And Jeroboam had set the battle in order with him, with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty men of valor.

4. And Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim in the hills of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel.

5. Do you not know that Jehovah the God of Israel has given the kingdom to David over Israel forever, to him and to his sons, a covenant of salt?

6. And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Solomon's servant, the son of David has risen up and rebelled against his lord.

7. And vain men gathered to him, sons of worthlessness, and they made themselves strong against Rehoboam the son of Solomon; and Rehoboam was a youth and tender of heart, and could not be strong against them.

8. And now you think to be strong against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David And you are a great host; yea, with you are calves of gold that Jeroboam has made as gods to you.

9. Have you not thrown out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made priests to yourselves like the peoples of the lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a bullock, a son of the herd, and seven rams, even he becomes a priest to no gods.

10. As for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; yea, priests are serving Jehovah, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, in the work,

11. and are offering to Jehovah burnt offerings morning by morning, and evening by evening, and sweet incense, and the Bread of Arrangement on the pure table, and the golden lampstand and its lamps, to burn evening by evening. For we are keeping the charge of Jehovah our God. And surely you have forsaken Him.

12. And, behold, God is with us at our head, and His priests, and the trumpets, the signal to sound for battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah, the God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper.   

13. But Jeroboam had made the ambush circle to come in behind them, and they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.

14. And Judah turned. And, behold, the battle was against them before and behind. And they cried to Jehovah, and the priests were blowing with trumpets.

15. And the men of Judah shouted. And it was, at the shouting of the men of Judah, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

16. And the sons of Israel fled from the face of Judah, and God gave them into their hand.

17. And Abijah and his people struck them with a great blow, and five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell slain.

18. And the sons of Israel were humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah were strong. For they leaned on Jehovah the God of their fathers.

19. And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured cities from him: Bethel and its villages, and Jeshanah and its villages, and Ephrain and its villages.

20. And Jeroboam did not regain power any more in Abijah's days. And Jehovah struck him, and he died.

21. And Abijah became mighty, and he took fourteen wives to himself. And he fathered twenty two sons and sixteen daughters.

22. And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his words, are written in the inquiry of the prophet Iddo.  

## 2 Chronicles 14

1. And Abijah lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Asa reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.

2. And Asa did the good and the right in the eyes of Jehovah his God.

3. And he removed the altars of the alien, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherahs.

4. And he commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.

5. And he removed the high places and the images out of all the cities of Judah. And the kingdom was quiet before him.

6. And he built fenced cities in Judah, for the land had quiet. And there was no war with him in these years, because Jehovah had given him rest.

7. And he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and walls around them , and towers, two leaved gates, and bars, while the land is before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God. We have sought, and He has given rest to us all around. And they built and prospered.

8. And Asa had an army bearing bucklers and spears three hundred thousand out of Judah, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benjamin, bearing shields and drawing bows; all these were mighty men of valor.   

9. And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a thousand thousands, and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah.

10. And Asa went out before him and they set the battle in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

11. And Asa called to Jehovah his God, and said, O Jehovah, it is nothing to You to help between the mighty and him with no strength. Help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rest on You, and in Your name we come against this host. O Jehovah, You are our God. Do not let man hold out against You.

12. And Jehovah struck the Cushites before Asa and before Judah. And the Ethiopians fled.

13. And Asa and the people with him pursued them even to Gerar. And all of the Cushites fell, for there was not one left alive to them; because they had broken before Jehovah, and before His army. And they carried away very much plunder.

14. And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Jehovah had come on them. And they plundered all the cities, for there was much booty in them.

15. And also they struck the tents of cattle, and they captured sheep and camels in abundance. And they returned to Jerusalem.  

## 2 Chronicles 15

1. And the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded.

2. And he went out before Asa, and said to him, Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. Jehovah is with you while you are with Him. And if you seek Him, He will be found by you. But if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.

3. Yea, Israel has been without a true God many days, and without a teaching priest, and without law.

4. And they turned in their distress to Jehovah the God of Israel, and they sought Him, and He was found by them.

5. And in those days there was no peace to him going out, or to him coming in, for much tumult was on all the inhabitants of the lands.

6. And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city. For God troubled them with every distress.

7. But you, you be strong, and do not let your hands be feeble, for there is a reward for your work.   

8. And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he made himself strong and removed the hateful idols out of the land of Judah and Benjamin; and out of the cities that he had captured from the hills of Ephraim. And he restored the altar of Jehovah that was before the porch of Jehovah.

9. And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and out of Simeon. For they had fallen to him in abundance from Israel when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.

10. And they were gathered to Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

11. And they sacrificed to Jehovah on that day, from the plunder they had brought in, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.

12. And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul.

13. And everyone who did not seek after Jehovah the God of Israel was put to death, from the small to the great, from man and to woman.

14. And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with rams' horns.

15. And all Judah rejoiced on the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart; and they sought Him with all their desire. And He was found by them. And Jehovah gave rest to them all around.

16. And also Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made a horrible image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her horrible image, and crushed and burned it by the torrent Kidron.

17. Yet the high places were not removed from Israel. Only, the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

18. And he brought the dedicated things of his father, and his own dedicated things, into the house of God, silver and gold and vessels.

19. And there was no war until the thirty fifth year of the reign of Asa.  

## 2 Chronicles 16

1. In the thirty sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel came up against Judah. And he built Ramah, so as not to permit any going out and coming in to Asa the king of Judah.

2. And Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and from the king's house; and he sent to Ben-hadad the king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,

3. A covenant shall be between me and you, and between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha the king of Israel, and he shall go away from me.

4. And Ben-hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the commanders of his armies to the cities of Israel. And they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

5. And it happened, when Baasha heard, he stopped building Ramah and let his work rest.

6. And Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its wood, with which Baasha had built. And he built Geba and Mizpah with them.   

7. And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa the king of Judah and said to him, Because you leaned on the king of Syria, and you have not leaned on Jehovah your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.

8. Did not the Cushites and the Lubim become a very great army for multitude, for chariots and for horsemen? And when you leaned on Jehovah, He gave them into your hand.

9. For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro in all the earth in order to be strong for those with their heart perfect toward Him. You have acted foolishly in this. For this reason, from now on there shall be wars with you.

10. And Asa was angry with the seer; and he gave him up to the house of stocks. For he was in a rage with him for this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.

11. And, behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

12. And Asa was diseased in his feet in the thirty ninth year of his reign, until his disease was severe. And also in his disease he did not seek Jehovah, but among the healers.

13. And Asa lay with his fathers, and died in the forty first year of his reign.

14. And they buried him in his grave which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which he had filled with sweet odors and kinds of aromatic herbs, with a mixture of ointments by art. And they burned a great burning for him.  

## 2 Chronicles 17

1. And his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place. And he made himself strong against Israel.

2. And he put an army in all the fortified cities in Judah, and placed command posts in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim which his father Asa had captured.

3. And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, for he walked in the first ways of his father David; and he did not seek to the Baals.

4. For he sought to the God of his father, and he walked in His commands, and not according to the deeds of Israel.

5. And Jehovah confirmed the kingdom in his hand. And all of Judah gave a present to Jehoshaphat. And he had riches and honor in abundance.

6. And his heart was exalted in the ways of Jehovah. And he again removed the high places and the Asherahs out of Judah.

7. And in the third year of his reign, he sent for his leaders, for Benhail, and for Obadiah, and for Zechariah, and for Nethaneel, and for Michaiah, in order to teach in the cities of Judah.

8. And with them were the Levites: Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites. And with them were Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.

9. And they taught in Judah; and with them was the book of the law of Jehovah. And they went around to all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.   

10. And the fear of Jehovah was on all the kingdoms of the lands around Judah; and they did not fight with Jehoshaphat.

11. And from the Philistines, they were bringing in a present to Jehoshaphat, and silver as tribute. Also, the Arabians were bringing flocks to him, seven thousand, seven hundred rams; and seven thousand, seven hundred he goats.

12. And Jehoshaphat went on to be greater, exceedingly. And he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.

13. And there was much work for him in the cities of Judah. And the men of war, mighty men of valor, resided in Jerusalem.

14. And these were their numbers, for the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands, Adnah the chief, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor.

15. And on his hand, Jehohanan the chief, and two hundred and eighty thousand with him.

16. And on his hand, Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered himself to Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.

17. And of Benjamin, Eliada a mighty man, and two hundred thousand armed men with bow and shield with him.

18. And on his hand, Jehozabad; and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready for war.

19. These waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities in all Judah.  

## 2 Chronicles 18

1. And Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and contracted a marriage with Ahab.

2. And at the end of years, he went down to Ahab, to Samaria. And Ahab sacrificed sheep and oxen in abundance for him, and for the people with him. And he persuaded him to go up to Ramoth-gilead.

3. And Ahab the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he said to him, As I am , so are you; and as your people, so my people, even with you in battle.   

4. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please seek the word of Jehovah today.

5. And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men. And he said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God will give it into the king's hand.

6. And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not a prophet of Jehovah still here, and we shall seek from him?

7. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, One man is still here, to seek Jehovah from him. But I hate him, for he does not prophesy good about me, but evil all his days. He is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

8. And the king of Israel called to a certain eunuch and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.

9. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting, each on his throne, clothed with robes. And they were sitting in a grain floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.

10. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself, and said, So says Jehovah, With these you shall push Syria until they are crushed.

11. With these you shall push Syria until you have consumed them. And all the prophets were prophesying so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper. And, Jehovah has given it into the king's hand.

12. And the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets speak with one mouth, good toward the king. And, Please let your word be like one of theirs, and you shall speak good.

13. And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, surely that which my God says, that I shall speak.

14. And he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go up to Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up and prosper, for they will be given into your hand.

15. And the king said to him, Until many times must I adjure you that you speak nothing to me but the truth in the name of Jehovah?

16. And he said, I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep with no shepherd for them; and Jehovah said, For these, no master. Let them return, each man to his own house in peace.

17. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say to you that he does not prophesy good concerning me, but rather evil?

18. And he said, Then hear the word of Jehovah: I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right and His left.

19. And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab the king of Israel, and he shall go and fall in Ramoth-gilead? And this speaker said this, and that speaker that.

20. And a spirit went out and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said, With what?

21. And he said, I will go out and become a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said, You shall entice, and also, you are able. Go out and do so.

22. And now, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets. And Jehovah has spoken evil against you.

23. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of Jehovah cross from me to speak to you?

24. And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in that day when you go from one room into another to hide.

25. And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the ruler of the city, and to Joash the king's son.

26. And you shall say, So says the king. Put this one in prison and cause him to eat the bread of pain, and the water of pain, until my return in peace.

27. And Micaiah said, If you indeed return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, O peoples, all of them!   

28. And the king of Israel went up, and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, to Ramoth-gilead.

29. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into battle; and you put on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself. And they went into battle.

30. And the king of Syria commanded the commanders of the chariots that he had, saying, You shall not fight with small or great, only with the king of Israel by himself.

31. And it happened, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, He is the king of Israel. And they turned around to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out. And Jehovah helped him. And God drew them away from him.

32. And it happened, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned away from following him.

33. And a man drew with a bow in innocence, and struck the king of Israel between the joinings and the breastplate. And he said to the charioteer, Turn your hand, and you shall bring me out of the battle, for I have been wounded.

34. And the battle increased on that day, and the king of Israel was made to stand in the chariot before Syria until the evening. And he died at the time of the going of the sun.  

## 2 Chronicles 19

1. And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.

2. And Jehu the son of Hanani, the seer, went out before him and said to king Jehoshaphat, Do you love to help the bad one, and those who hate Jehovah, and by this bring wrath on you from the face of Jehovah?

3. But good things have been found with you, for you have burned the Asherahs out of the land, and have fixed your heart to seek God.

4. And Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people, from Beersheba to the hills of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.   

5. And he placed judges in the land, in all the fortified cities of Judah, for every city;

6. and said to the judges, Watch what you are doing, for you shall not judge for man, but for Jehovah, and He is with you in the matter of judgment;

7. and now, let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; watch and act, for there is no perverseness with Jehovah our God, nor lifting up of faces, nor taking of a bribe.

8. And also in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat caused to stand from the Levites and from the priests, and from the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for strife; and they returned to Jerusalem.

9. And he charged them, saying, So shall you do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

10. And when any contention shall come to you from your brothers who are living in their cities, between blood and blood between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, then you shall warn them, and they shall not be guilty before Jehovah; and wrath shall not be on you and on your brothers; so you shall do, and you shall not be guilty.

11. And, behold, Amariah the chief priest shall be over you for every matter of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, shall be for every matter of the king; and the Levites shall be officers before you. Be strong and act; and Jehovah shall be with the good.  

## 2 Chronicles 20

1. And after this it happened that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon came in, and with them from the Ammonites, to battle against Jehoshaphat.

2. And they came in and spoke to Jehoshaphat, saying, A great multitude has come against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi.

3. And Jehoshaphat feared, and set his face to seek to Jehovah, and proclaimed a fast over all Judah.

4. And Judah was gathered to inquire of Jehovah; also they came in to seek Jehovah from all the cities of Judah.

5. And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, at the front of the new court,

6. and said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, are not You the God in Heaven? Yea, You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is power and might; and there is none able to withstand You.

7. Are You not our God? You have driven out the inhabitants of this land from before Your people Israel, and have given it to the seed of Abraham, Your friend forever;

8. and they have lived in it, and have built in it a sanctuary to You for Your name, saying,

9. If evil shall come upon us, whether sword, judgment, or pestilence and famine, we shall stand before this house and before You, for Your name is in this house. and shall cry to You out of our distress, and You shall hear and save.

10. And now, behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You did not allow Israel to go against when they came out of the land of Egypt, (for they turned away from them and did not destroy them)

11. yea, behold, they are repaying us by coming in to drive us out of Your possession, that You have caused us to possess.

12. O our God, shall You not execute judgment upon them? For there is no power in us before this great multitude that has come against us, and we do not know what we shall do; but our eyes are on You.

13. And all Judah was standing before Jehovah, and their infants and their wives and their sons.   

14. And on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, the Spirit of Jehovah came on him in the midst of the assembly;

15. and He said, Listen, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and king Jehoshaphat; so says Jehovah to you, You shall not fear nor be terrified of the face of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's.

16. Tomorrow, go down against them; behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and you shall find them in the end of the valley, at the front of the wilderness of Jeruel.

17. You shall not fight in this: station yourselves; stand and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; do not be terrified nor fear; tomorrow go out before them, and Jehovah shall be with you.

18. And Jehoshaphat bowed his nose to the earth, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, to bow themselves to Jehovah.

19. And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the sons of the Korahites, rose to give praise to Jehovah the God of Israel with a loud voice on high.   

20. And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in Jehovah your God, and be steadfast; believe in His prophets and prosper.

21. And he consulted with the people, and appointed singers to Jehovah, and those giving praise to the glory of holiness, when going out before those armed, and said, Give thanks to Jehovah, for His mercy endures forever.

22. And at the time they began with rejoicing and praise, Jehovah set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, that had come against Judah; and they were stricken.

23. And the sons of Ammon stood up, and Moab, against the people of Mount Seir, to devote and destroy; and when they finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped, each man against his neighbor, to destroy.

24. And when Judah had come to the watchtower, to the wilderness, then they looked toward the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there was no survivor.

25. And Jehoshaphat and his people came to seize their plunder; and they found among them in abundance both riches and valuable things on the corpses; and they stripped off for themselves until there was no carrying it ; and they were three days plundering the spoil; for it was much.

26. And on the fourth day they gathered at the Valley of Blessing, for they blessed Jehovah there; on account of this they have called the name of that place the Valley of Blessing to this day.

27. And they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.

28. And they entered Jerusalem with harps and with lyres, and with trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.

29. And there was a fear of God on all kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought with the enemies of Israel.

30. And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, and his God gave him rest all around.   

31. And Jehoshaphat was king over Judah, a son of thirty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty five years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

32. And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, to do the right in the eyes of Jehovah.

33. Only, the high places were not removed, and the people still had not settled their hearts for the God of their fathers.

34. And the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which were taken up in the Book of the Kings of Israel.

35. And after this Jehoshaphat the king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah the king of Israel; he did wickedly to do so.

36. And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Eziongeber.

37. And Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken your works. And the ships were broken, so that they did not hold to go to Tarshish.  

## 2 Chronicles 21

1. And Jehoshaphat lay with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his son Jehoram reigned in his place.

2. And he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat the king of Israel.

3. And their father gave to them many gifts of silver and gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities of Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the firstborn.

4. And Jehoram rose up over the kingdom of his father and made himself strong. And he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also of the leaders of Israel.

5. Jehoram was a son of thirty two years when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.

6. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.

7. And Jehovah was not willing to destroy the house of David, for the sake of the covenant that He made with David, and as He had spoken, to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.

8. In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king to reign over them.

9. And Jehoram passed over with his chiefs, and all the chariots with him; and it happened that he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who were coming all around him; and the commanders of the chariots.

10. And Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at that time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.

11. Also, he had made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the people of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and led astray Judah.   

12. And a writing came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, So says Jehovah, the God of your father David, Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat, and in the ways of Asa the king of Judah,

13. and you walk in the way of the kings of Israel, and caused Judah and the people of Jerusalem to commit fornication like the fornications of the house of Ahab; and also you have killed your brothers, the house of your father, who were better than yourself;

14. behold, Jehovah shall strike with a great destruction among your people, and among your sons, and among your wives, and among all your goods;

15. and you, with many sicknesses, with disease in your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the sickness, day by day.

16. And Jehovah awakened the spirit of the Philistines against Jehoram, and of the Arabians who were beside the Ethiopians;

17. and they came up into Judah and broke into it, and captured all the substance that was found at the king's house, and also his sons, and his wives; and there was not left to him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.

18. And after this, Jehovah plagued him in his bowels by disease for which there was no healing;

19. and it happened, from days to days, and as the time went out, the end of two years of days, his bowels went out because of his sickness; so he died of painful diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.

20. He was a son of thirty two years when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he left without being desired, and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the graves of the kings.  

## 2 Chronicles 22

1. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king in his place (for all the first ones had been slain by the troop that came in with the Arabians to the battle) and Ahaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah reigned.

2. Ahaziah was a son of forty two years when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

3. He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do evilly.

4. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, for his destruction.

5. He also walked in their counsel, and went with Joram the son of Ahab the king of Israel to battle against Hazael the king of Syria, in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians struck Jehoram;

6. and he returned to be healed in Jezreel, because of the wounds with which they had stricken him in Ramah, when fighting with Hazael the king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.

7. Now, the destruction of Ahaziah was from God, for coming to Jehoram; and when he had come he went out with Jehoram to Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.

8. And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, that he found the leaders of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, the servants of Ahaziah, and killed them.

9. And he sought out Ahaziah, and they captured him (and he was hiding himself in Samaria) and brought him to Jehu, and put him to death, and buried him; for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And there was none in the house of Ahaziah to retain power for the kingdom.   

10. And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, and she rose up and spoke to destroy all the seed of the kingdom of the house of Judah.

11. And Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the sons of the king who were put to death, and put him and his nurse into the store room of the bedroom. And Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was the sister of Ahaziah, hid him from the face of Athaliah; and she did not put him to death.

12. And he was with them in the house of God hiding himself six years, and Athaliah reigned over the land.  

## 2 Chronicles 23

1. And in the seventh year Jehoiada made himself strong and took the commanders of the hundreds, even Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.

2. And they went around in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

3. And all the congregation made a covenant in the house of God with the king, and he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah has spoken of the sons of David.

4. This is what you shall do: the third of you going in on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, shall be keepers of the doors;

5. and a third shall be at the king's house, and a third at the gate of the foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.

6. And no one shall enter the house of Jehovah except the priests and those ministering of the Levites; they may go in, for they are holy; and all the people shall keep the watch of Jehovah.

7. And the Levites shall surround the king, each with his weapon in his hand; and he who goes into the house shall be put to death; and you be with the king in his coming in and in his going out.

8. And the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded. And every man took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, the ones who were to go out on the sabbath. For Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions.

9. And Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of the hundreds the spears, and the shields, and the bucklers that were king David's, that were in the house of God.

10. And he stationed all of the people, and each had his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, at the altar, and by the king at the house all around.

11. And they brought out the son of the king, and put the crown on him, and the testimony, and made him king; and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and cried, Let the king live!   

12. And Athaliah heard the sound of the people who were running and who were praising the king; and she came to the people in the house of Jehovah,

13. and looked; and behold, the king was standing by his pillar in the entrance, and the commanders and the trumpets were by the king; and all the people of the land were rejoicing and sounding with trumpets; and the singers with instruments of song, and giving signals to praise; and Athaliah tore her garments and cried, Treason! Treason!

14. And Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of the hundreds, those over the army, and said to them, Bring her out from inside the ranks, and he coming after her shall be put to death by the sword; for the priest said, Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah.

15. And they laid hands to her, and she came into the entrance of the Gate of Horses, beside the king's house, and they put her to death there.

16. And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and between all the people, and between the king, to be a people to Jehovah;

17. and all the people went into the house of Baal and broke it down; yea, they broke down his altars and his images; and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

18. And Jehoiada put the offices of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the Levitical priests, whom David had allotted over the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses; with joy, and with singing, by the hands of David.

19. And he stationed the keepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah; and the unclean could not in any way go in.

20. And he took the commanders of the hundreds, and the honorable ones, and the rulers among the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of Jehovah; and they came in through the Upper Gate to the king's house, and made the king sit on the throne of the kingdom.

21. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And they put to death Athaliah by the sword.  

## 2 Chronicles 24

1. Joash was a son of seven years when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Zibiah of Beersheba.

2. And Joash did the right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

3. And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he fathered sons and daughters.

4. And after this it happened; it had been in the heart of Joash to renew the house of Jehovah;

5. and he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God fully from year to year; and you shall do the matter quickly. But the Levites did not act quickly.

6. And the king called for Jehoiada the head, and said to him, Why have you not required the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of the testimony?

7. For the sons of Athaliah, the wicked one, have broken up the house of God, and also they have prepared all the holy things of the house of Jehovah for the Baals.

8. And the king commanded, and they made one chest, and put it at the gate of the house of Jehovah outside;

9. and they gave a call in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring in to Jehovah the tribute of Moses, the servant of God, laid on Israel in the wilderness.

10. And all the leaders, and all the people rejoiced; and they brought in and threw into the chest until it was finished.

11. And it happened, at the time one brought in the chest to the king's overseers, by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that the silver was much a scribe of the king came in, and an officer of the head priest, and they emptied the chest and took it up and returned it to its place; so they did day by day, and gathered much silver.

12. And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired stone cutters and carpenters to repair the house of Jehovah; and also artisans in iron and bronze to strengthen the house of Jehovah.

13. And the workmen did the work and the repair work prospered in their hands; and they set up the house of God by its proper measure, and made it strong.

14. And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the silver in before the king and Jehoiada; and they made vessels of it for the house of Jehovah, vessels of serving, and of offering, and spoons, even vessels of gold and silver; and they offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.   

15. And Jehoiada was old and satisfied with days, and died, a son of a hundred and thirty years at his death.

16. And they buried him in the city of David with the kings, for he had done good in Israel, and with God, and his house.

17. And after the death of Jehoiada, the leaders of Judah came in and bowed themselves to the king; then the king listened to them.

18. And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols; and there was wrath on Judah and Jerusalem because of this guilt.

19. And He sent prophets among them to bring them back to Jehovah; and they testified against them, but they did not listen.

20. And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood before the people and said to them, So says God, Why do you transgress the commandments of Jehovah, and do not prosper? Because you have forsaken Jehovah, He has forsaken you.

21. And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones by the command of the king, in the court of the house of Jehovah.

22. And Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada his father had done to him, and killed his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah shall seek you out .

23. And it happened, at the turn of the year, that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came into Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people; and they sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.

24. For with few men the army of Syria came in, and Jehovah gave a mighty force for multitude into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. And they executed judgment against Joash.

25. And when they departed from him (they left him with many diseases) his own servants conspired against him, because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed; and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, and did not bury him in the graves of the kings.

26. And these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.

27.  As to his sons, and the greatness of the burdens upon him, and the foundation of the house of God, behold, they are written in the inquiry of the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 25

1. Amaziah was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

2. And he did the right in the eyes of Jehovah; only, not with a perfect heart.

3. And it happened, when the kingdom had been made strong to him, he killed his servants, those who had struck the king, his father.

4. But he did not kill their sons, but did as is written in the law, in the Book of Moses, whom Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers; but they each shall die for his own sin.

5. And Amaziah gathered Judah, and made them stand, according to the house of the fathers, for commanders of the thousands, and for commanders of the hundreds, for all Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from a son of twenty years and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice ones, going forth to battle, holding spear and shield.

6. And he hired a hundred thousand mighty ones out of Israel, with a hundred talents of silver.

7. But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you; for Jehovah is not with Israel, with all the sons of Ephraim;

8. but if you will go, do it ; be strong for battle; God shall make you fall before the enemy, for God has power to help, and to cause to stumble.

9. And Amaziah said to the man of God, And what shall I do for the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God said, Jehovah has more than this to give to you.

10. And Amaziah separated them, the army that had come into him from Ephraim to go to their own place; and their anger burned mightily against Judah, and they returned to their place in the heat of anger.

11. And Amaziah made himself strong and led his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and killed ten thousand of the sons of Seir.

12. And the sons of Judah captured ten thousand alive, and they brought them to the top of the rock and threw them from the top of the rock; and all of them were broken.

13. And the sons of the army that Amaziah had sent back from going with him to battle, these raided against the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and killed three thousand of them, and seized much prey.   

14. And it happened, after Amaziah came in from smiting the Edomites, that he brought in the gods of the sons of Seir and made them stand as gods for himself; and bowed himself before them, and burned incense to them.

15. And the anger of Jehovah burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him; and he said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people that have not delivered their people out of your hand?

16. And it happened, as he spoke with him, that he said to him, Have we appointed you a counselor to the king? Stop! Why should they strike you? And the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has counseled to destroy you because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.   

17. And Amaziah the king of Judah took counsel and sent to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.

18. And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah the king of Judah, saying, The thorn that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son for a wife; and a beast of the field that  was in Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorn.

19. You have said, behold, I have stricken Edom, and your heart has lifted you up to boast; now, stay in your house; why should you stir yourself up to evil, that you should fall, you and Judah with you?

20. And Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, in order to give them into their hand, because they had sought to the gods of Edom.

21. And Jehoash the king of Israel went up, and they looked one another in the face, he and Amaziah the king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh that was Judah's.

22. And Judah was stricken before Israel; and they fled, each to his tent.

23. And Amaziah the king of Judah, the son of Joash, was caught by Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel in Beth-shemesh; and he carried him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.

24. And he took all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.

25. And Amaziah the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel.

26. And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?

27. And after the time that Amaziah had turned aside from following Jehovah, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.

28. And they lifted him up on the horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.  

## 2 Chronicles 26

1. And all the people of Judah took Uzziah; and he was a son of sixteen years; and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

2. He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king lay with his fathers.

3. Uzziah was a son of sixteen years when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty two years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

4. And he did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah did.

5. And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in the days he sought Jehovah, God made him prosper.

6. And he went out and fought with the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities around Ashdod, and among the Philistines.

7. And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal, and the Meunim.

8. And the Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah; and his name spread abroad to the entrance of Egypt; for he became exceedingly strong.

9. And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, and at the Valley Gate, and at the Turning, and fortified them.

10. And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had many cattle, both in the low country and in the plain; also he had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains, and in Carmel; for he was a lover of the earth.

11. And Uzziah had an army making war, going out to the battle by troops, according to the number of their account by the. hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maaseiah the superintendent under the hand of Hananiah, of the king's leaders.

12. The whole number of the heads of the fathers of the mighty men was two thousand, six hundred.

13. And under their hand was a powerful army, three hundred and seven thousand, five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.

14. And Uzziah prepared for them, for all the army, shields and spears and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, even to stones for the slings.

15. And he made engines in Jerusalem, the inventions of skillful men, to be on the towers and on the corners, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was wonderfully helped until he was strong.   

16. And when he became strong, his heart was lifted up to act corruptly; and he trespassed against Jehovah his God, and went in to the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense.

17. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and eighty priests of Jehovah with him, sons of valor;

18. and they stood up against Uzziah the king, and said to him, It is not for you, O Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are sanctified to burn incense; go out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed; and it is not to your honor from Jehovah God.

19. And Uzziah was angry, and in his hand was a censer to burn incense; and when he was angry with the priests, the leprosy rose in his forehead, before the priests, in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.

20. And Azariah the head priest and all the priests turned toward him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead. And they hurried him from there, and he also himself hurried to leave, for Jehovah had touched him.

21. And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house as a leper, for he had been cut off from the house of Jehovah; and his son Jotham was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.

22. And the rest of the acts of Uzziah, the first and the last, Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, has written.

23. And Uzziah lay with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burying place that the kings had; for they said, He is a leper. And his son Jotham reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 27

1. Jotham was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

2. And he did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah did; only, he did not come into the temple of Jehovah; and the people continued to do wickedly.

3. He built the Upper Gate of the house of Jehovah, and he built very much in the wall of Ophel;

4. and he built cities in the hills of Judah, and in the forests he built palaces and towers.

5. He also fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and. prevailed over them. And the sons of Ammon gave to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley; this the sons of Ammon turned over to him in the second year and in the third.

6. And Jotham made himself strong, for he had prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.

7. And the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

8. He was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

9. And Jotham lay with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 28

1. Ahaz was a son of twenty years when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do right in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father David,

2. but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made casted images for the Baals.

3. And he himself burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah drove out from before the sons of Israel;

4. and sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and on the heights, and under every green tree.

5. And Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, and they struck him, and captured from him a great captivity, and brought them to Damascus. And he also was given into the hand of the king of Israel, and he struck him with a great destruction.   

6. And Pekah the son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all sons of valor, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

7. And Zichri, a mighty one of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, and Azrikam the leader of the house, and Elkanah, second to the king.

8. And the sons of Israel captured two hundred thousand of their brothers, wives, sons and daughters, and also they seized from them much spoil, and they brought the spoil to Samaria.

9. And a prophet of Jehovah was there, Oded his name; and he went out before the army that had come in to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, in the fury of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, against Judah, He has given them into your hand, and you have slain among them in rage. It has touched to the heavens.

10. And now you are planning to tread down the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for male slaves, and for girl slaves to yourselves; but are not with you causes of guilt, solely yours, before Jehovah your God?

11. And now, hear me, and return the captives you have seized from your brothers, for the heat of the anger of Jehovah is on you.

12. And men of the leaders of the Ephraimites: Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah, Meshillemoth's son, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, rose up against those coming in from the army.

13. And they said to them, You shall not bring the captives here, for guilt against Jehovah is on us; you are planning to add to our sin and to our guilt, for plenty of guilt is ours, and the glow of anger on Israel.

14. And the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the congregation.

15. And the men who had been called by name rose and took the captives, and they clothed all the naked ones from the spoil; yea, they clothed them and shod them, and made them eat and drink, and anointed them, and led them out on asses, even every feeble one, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palms, near their brothers, and returned to Samaria.   

16. At that time king Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him.

17. And again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and had seized a captivity.

18. And the Philistines had raided against the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and captured Beth-shemesh and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho and its daughter villages, and Timnah and its daughter villages, and Gimzo and its daughter villages, and dwelt there.

19. For Jehovah had humbled Judah because of Ahaz the king of Israel, for he loosed immorality in Judah, and dealt treacherously against Jehovah.

20. And Tilgathpilneser the king of Assyria came against him and distressed him, but did not help him,

21. though Ahaz had taken a lot from the house of Jehovah and from the house of the king, and from the rulers, and had given to the king of Assyria; yet it was no help to him.

22. And in the time of his distress he added to act slyly against Jehovah, this king Ahaz;

23. and he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus who had struck him, and said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria are helping them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me. But they were to cause him and all Israel to stumble.

24. And Ahaz gathered all the utensils of the house of God, and he cut up the utensils of the house of God and shut the doors of the house of Jehovah. And he made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.

25. And in every city, even the cities of Judah, he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and angered Jehovah the God of his fathers.

26. And the rest of his acts, and all his ways, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

27. And Ahaz lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, but did not bring him to the graves of the kings of Israel. and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 29

1. Hezekiah was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty nine years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

2. And he did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father David did.

3. In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them.

4. And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and he gathered them to the plaza on the east.

5. And he said to them, Hear me, O Levites, now consecrate yourselves. And consecrate the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and bring out the uncleanness from the holy place.

6. For our fathers have acted slyly and did the evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God, and they have forsaken Him and turned their faces away from the temple of Jehovah, and have given their backs.

7. And they have shut the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and they have not burned incense, and have not offered burnt offering in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.

8. And the wrath of Jehovah is on Judah and Jerusalem, and He has given them for a trembling, for a horror, and for hissing, as you see with your eyes.

9. For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in exile for this.

10. Now it is in my heart to cut a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, and the glow of His anger shall turn back from us.

11. Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before His face, to serve Him and to be ministers and incense burners for Him.   

12. And the Levites rose up: Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;

13. and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;

14. and of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.

15. And they gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, and came in, according to the commandment of the king in the matters of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.

16. And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to clean, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah to the court of the house of Jehovah; and the Levites received and took it out to the torrent Kidron outside.

17. And they began to sanctify on the first of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they had finished.

18. And they came inside to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of the burnt offering, and all its vessels, and the table of the Bread of Arrangement, and all its utensils;

19. and all the utensils that king Ahaz cast aside in his reign, in his treachery, we have prepared and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.   

20. And Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the heads of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.

21. And they brought in seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven young he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the holy place, and for Judah. And he commanded the sons of Aaron, the priests, to offer on the altar of Jehovah.

22. And they killed the oxen, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.

23. And they brought the he goats of the sin offering before the king and the congregation, and they lay their hands on them;

24. and the priests slaughtered them, and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to atone for all Israel; for the king said, The burnt offering and the sin offering are for all Israel.

25. And he made stand the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres, by the command of David, and of Gad, the seer of the king, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was by the hand of Jehovah, by the hand of His prophets.

26. And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

27. And Hezekiah commanded to offer burnt offering on the altar; and at the time the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah began, and of the trumpets, even by the hand of the instruments of David the king of Israel.

28. And all the congregation were bowing, and the singers singing, and the trumpeters blowing; all until the completion of the burnt offering.

29. And at the completion of the offering the king and all those found with him bowed and worshiped.

30. And Hezekiah the king and the leaders commanded the Levites to give praise to Jehovah in the words of David, and of Asaph the seer; and they praised with joy, and they bowed and worshiped.

31. And Hezekiah answered and said, Now you have consecrated your hand to Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Jehovah. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and every willing hearted one brought burnt offerings.

32. And the number of the burnt offerings that the congregation brought was seventy oxen, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs; all these for a burnt offering to Jehovah.

33. And the dedicated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.

34. Only, the priests had become few, and were not able to skin all of the burnt offerings; and their brothers the Levites strengthened them until the work was ended, and until the priests sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright of heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

35. And also, there were many burnt offerings with fat of the peace offerings, and with drink offerings for the burnt offering; and the service of the house of Jehovah was established.

36. And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced, because God had given preparation to the people; for the thing had happened suddenly.  

## 2 Chronicles 30

1. And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, to make a Passover to Jehovah the God of Israel.

2. And the king and his leaders, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, took counsel to keep the Passover in the second month;

3. since they could not do it at that time, for the priests had not cleansed themselves enough. And the people had not been gathered to Jerusalem.

4. And the thing was right in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of the congregation.

5. And they established a decree to pass through a call to all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, to come to make a Passover to Jehovah the God of Israel in Jerusalem. For not many of them had done as it is written.

6. And the runners went with letters from the king's hand, and his leaders, to all Israel and Judah; even by the king's command, saying, O sons of Israel return to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. And He shall return to the remnant left of you from the hand of the king of Assyria.

7. And do not be like your fathers, and like your brothers, who acted treacherously against Jehovah the God of their fathers; and He made them for a horror, as you see.

8. Now do not stiffen your necks like your fathers. Give a hand to Jehovah and come to His holy place that He has sanctified forever; and serve Jehovah your God. And the fierceness of His anger will turn away from you.

9. For when you return to Jehovah, your brothers and your sons will have mercies before their captors, even to return to this land. For Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and He will not turn His face away from you, if you turn back to Him.

10. And the runners passed from city to city in the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, even to Zebulun. And they were laughing at them, and mocking them.

11. However, men from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun were humbled, and came to Jerusalem.

12. Also, in Judah the hand of God was to give to them one heart to do the king's command, and of the leaders, by the word of Jehovah.   

13. And many people gathered to Jerusalem, to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very great multitude.

14. And they rose up and took away the altars in Jerusalem, and all the incense altars they removed, and threw them into the torrent Kidron.

15. And they killed the passover offering on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.

16. And they stood in their place according to their ordinance, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests were sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the Levites.

17. For many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves, and the Levites were over the slaughtering of the passover offerings for everyone not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.

18. For many of the people, many from Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not been cleansed, but ate the passover otherwise than was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, O good Jehovah, provide atonement for

19. everyone who has prepared his heart to seek Jehovah God, the God of his fathers, yet not according to the cleansing of the sanctuary.

20. And Jehovah listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.   

21. And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy. And the Levites praised Jehovah day to day, and the priests, with instruments of praise before Jehovah.

22. And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites, those having good understanding as to Jehovah. And they ate the appointed things seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

23. And all the congregation took counsel to keep another seven days. And they kept seven days joyfully.

24. And Hezekiah the king of Judah had lifted up to the congregation a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep. And the leaders had lifted up to the congregation a thousand bullocks, and ten thousand sheep. And the priests had sanctified themselves in abundance.

25. And all the congregation of Judah rejoiced, and the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came from the land of Israel, and the aliens who came from the land of Israel, and those who lived in Judah.

26. And there was great joy in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel, there was nothing like this in Jerusalem.

27. And the priests, the Levites, rose up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to Heaven.  

## 2 Chronicles 31

1. And when all this was finished, all Israel who were found went out to the cities of Judah and smashed the standing pillars, and cut down the Asherahs, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah, and Benjamin, and in Ephraim, and Manasseh, even to the end. And all the sons of Israel returned, each to his possession, to their cities.

2. And Hezekiah made stand the courses of the priests and of the Levites, by their divisions, each according to his service, of the priests and of the Levites, for burnt offerings, and for peace offerings, to serve and to give thanks, and to give praise in the gates of the camps of Jehovah.

3. And the king's portion from his substance was for burnt offerings, for burnt offerings of the morning and the evening; and the burnt offerings of the sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of the appointed seasons, as it was written in the law of Jehovah.

4. And he commanded the people, those who lived in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and of the Levites, in order that they might be made strong in the law of Jehovah.

5. And as the word spread, the sons of Israel brought abundantly the firstfruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field, and the tithe of all; they brought very much.

6. And the sons of Israel and Judah, those living in the cities of Judah, also they tithed of the herd and the flock, even a tithe of the holy things that were sanctified to Jehovah their God, were brought in. And they piled heaps of heaps.

7. They began to lay the foundation of the heaps in the third month, and in the seventh month they finished.

8. And Hezekiah and the leaders came in and saw the heaps, and blessed Jehovah and His people Israel.

9. And Hezekiah asked the priests and the Levites about the heaps.

10. And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, spoke to him and said, From the beginning of the bringing of the heave offering to the house of Jehovah, it was eaten, and it satisfied, and abundance was left; for Jehovah has blessed His people, and this abundance is left.   

11. And Hezekiah ordered them to build rooms in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared,

12. and they brought in the heave offering, and the tithes, and the holy things, faithfully. And over them was a leader, the Levite Cononiah, and his second brother, Shimei;

13. and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and his brother Shimei, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

14. And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the heave offerings of Jehovah, and the most holy things.

15. And by his hand, Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, faithfully to give to their brothers by divisions, as to the great, so to the small;

16. apart from their genealogy, to males from a son of three years and upward, to everyone who had gone into the house of Jehovah, the proper portion of a day in its day, for their service in their duties, according to their divisions;

17. and enrolled genealogically the priests by the house of their fathers, and of the Levites from a son of twenty years and upward, and their duties, and their divisions;

18. and the enrollment by genealogy with all their infants, their wives, and their sons and their daughters, to all the assembly, for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.

19. And to the sons of Aaron, the priests, in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every separate city, were men who were called by name to give portions to every male among the priests, and to all enrolled genealogically among the Levites.

20. And Hezekiah did this in all Judah, and did the good and the right and true before Jehovah his God.

21. And in every work that he began for the service of the house of God, and in the Law, and in the commandment, to seek his God with all his heart, he worked and prospered.  

## 2 Chronicles 32

1. After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came; yea, he came into Judah and camped against the cities of defense, and commanded to break them open to himself.

2. And Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and his face was set to battle against Jerusalem;

3. and he took counsel with his leaders and his mighty ones, to stop the waters of the fountains that were on the outside of the city; and they helped him.

4. And many people were gathered, and they stopped all the fountains, and the torrent that was rushing through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?

5. And he made himself strong and built all the wall that was broken, and raised on it the towers, and another at the outside of the wall, and strengthened Millo, the city of David, and made darts in abundance, and shields.

6. And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them to him, to the street of the gate of the city, and spoke to their heart, saying,

7. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor be cast down before the face of the king of Assyria, and before the face of all the multitude with him, for with us are more than with him.

8. With him is an arm of flesh, and with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people were supported by the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah.   

9. After this Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (and he was by Lachish, and all his power with him) against Hezekiah the king of Judah, and against all Judah in Jerusalem, saying,

10. So says Sennacherib the king of Assyria, On what are you trusting that you sit under siege in Jerusalem?

11. Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you up to die by famine, and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?

12. Has not Hezekiah himself removed His high places, and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar you shall worship, and on it you shall burn incense.

13. Do you not know what I have done, my fathers and I, to all the people of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?

14. Who among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers have devoted to destruction is he who has been able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your god may be able to deliver you out of my hand?

15. And now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, nor believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand, from the hand of my fathers; also, surely your god shall not deliver you from my hand.

16. And again his servants spoke against Jehovah God, and against His servant Hezekiah.

17. And he had written letters to blaspheme Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah shall not deliver His people from my hand.

18. And they called with a great voice in Jewish, against the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and to terrify them, that they might capture the city.

19. And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of the hands of man.

20. And Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, prayed about this, and they cried to Heaven.

21. And Jehovah sent an angel, and cut off every mighty one of valor, both the leader and the ruler, in the camp of the king of Assyria; and he returned with shame of face to his land. And he entered the house of his god, and those from his bowels caused him to fall there by the sword.

22. And Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all; and He guided them on every side.

23. And many brought an offering to Jehovah, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah the king of Judah; and he was lifted up before the eyes of all the nations after this.   

24. In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death, and he prayed to Jehovah, and He spoke to him, and gave a sign for him.

25. And Hezekiah did not return according to the benefit done to him, for his heart had been lifted up, and there was wrath on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.

26. And Hezekiah was humbled for the pride of his heart, he and the people of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah did not come on them in the days of Hezekiah.

27. And Hezekiah had great riches and honor, and he had very many treasures of silver for himself, and of gold, and of precious stones, and of spices, and of shields, and of all desirable vessels,

28. and storehouses for the increase of grain, and new wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks for the stalls;

29. and he made cities for himself, and had stocks of flocks and very many herds, for God had given him very much property.

30. And Hezekiah himself had stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and had directed them beneath the west of the city of David; and Hezekiah prospered in all his work.

31. Even so with the envoys of the rulers of Babylon, those sent to him to inquire of the wonder that had been in the land, God left him to test him, to know all his heart.

32. And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his godly deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, and in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

33. And Hezekiah lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the uppermost of the graves of the sons of David; and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh reigned in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 33

1. Manasseh was a son of twelve years when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty five years.

2. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel.

3. For again he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had broken down, and raised up altars for the Baals, and made Asherahs and bowed himself to all the host of the heavens, and served them.

4. And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem shall be My name forever.

5. And he built altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.

6. And he made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and did magic and divined, and used sorcery, and used mediums and conjurers; he multiplied the doing of the evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.

7. And he placed the engraved image of the idol that he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David, and to his son Solomon, In this house, and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever.

8. And I will not again remove the foot of Israel from off the ground that I appointed to your fathers; only, if they take heed to do all that I have commanded them toward all the law, and the statutes, and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.

9. And Manasseh caused Judah and the people of Jerusalem to sin, to do evil above the nations that Jehovah destroyed before the sons of Israel.

10. And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and to his people, and they did not listen.   

11. And Jehovah brought against them the king of Assyria's army commanders, and they captured Manasseh with hooks, and bound him with bronze fetters, and made him go to Babylon.

12. And when he was afflicted, he sought the face of Jehovah his God, and was humbled exceedingly before the face of the God of his fathers;

13. and prayed to Him, and He was entreated of him and heard his supplication, and returned him to Jerusalem to his kingdom; and Manasseh knew that Jehovah, He is God.

14. And after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entrance of the Fish Gate. And it went around to the tower and he made it exceedingly high, and he put commanders of the army in all the cities of defense in Judah.

15. And he removed the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and threw them outside the city.

16. And he built the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificed on it sacrifices of peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.

17. But the people still sacrificed in the high places, only to Jehovah their God.

18. And the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the things of the seers, who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they are in the Book of the Kings of Israel;

19. and his prayer, and his entreaty, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he had built high places and set up the Asherahs and the graven images before he was humbled, behold, they are written in the Matters of the Seers.

20. And Manasseh lay with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son Amon reigned in his place.   

21. Amon was a son of twenty two years when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.

22. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father Manasseh did; and Amon sacrificed to all the graven images that his father Manasseh had made, and served them.

23. And he did not bow before Jehovah, like the humbling of his father Manasseh, for Amon himself multiplied guilt.

24. And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his own house;

25. and the people of the land killed all those who conspired against king Amon and the people of the land made his son Josiah to reign in his place.  

## 2 Chronicles 34

1. Josiah was a son of eight years when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty one years.

2. And he did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father David, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left.

3. And in the eighth year of his reign, and he was still a boy, he began to seek to the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherahs, and the graven images, and the casted images.

4. And they broke down before him the altars of the Baals, and the images that were on high above them he cut down, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images he broke down and beat small, and scattered on the surface of the grave of those who sacrificed to them.

5. And he burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem,

6. and in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their tools all around.

7. And he broke down the altars and the Asherahs, and he had beaten down the graven images very small; and he had cut down all the images in all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.   

8. And in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purified the land and the House, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the head of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.

9. And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and they gave the silver brought into the house of God, that the Levites who guarded the threshold had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

10. And they gave it into the hand of the doers of the work, those called out in the house of Jehovah; and they gave it to the doers of the work who were working in the house of Jehovah to repair and to make strong the house.

11. And they gave to artisans, and to builders, to buy quarried stones and wood for couplings, to make beams for the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.

12. And the men were working faithfully in the work. And over them were given the oversight: Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah, and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the Levites all who were skilled in musical instruments;

13. and over the load carriers and overseers of everyone doing work for each separate service; and of the Levites were scribes and superintendents and gatekeepers.   

14. And when they brought out the silver brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

15. And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.

16. And Shaphan brought the Book in to the king, and brought the king back word again, saying, All that has been given into the hand of your servants, they are doing.

17. And they poured out the silver found in the house of Jehovah, and gave it into the hands of those appointed, and into the hands of those doing the work.

18. And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given a book to me; and Shaphan read it before the king.

19. And it happened, when the king heard the words of the Law, that he tore his garments.

20. And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying,

21. Go, seek Jehovah for me and for him who is left in Israel and in Judah, as to the words of the book that has been found, for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this book.

22. And Hilkiah and those of the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the robes; and she was living in Jerusalem in the Second. And they spoke to her about this.

23. And she said to them, So says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Say to the man who has sent you to Me,

24. So says Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the Book that they have read before the king of Judah;

25. because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods so as to provoke Me with all the works of their hands; and My wrath shall be poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.

26. And to the king of Judah who is sending you to inquire of Jehovah, you shall say this to him, So says Jehovah the God of Israel, whose words you have heard,

27. Because your heart is tender, and you were humbled before God when you heard His words concerning this place, and concerning its inhabitants, and were humbled before Me, and have torn your garments and wept before Me; I have even heard also, says Jehovah.

28. Behold I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not look upon all the evil I shall bring upon this place, and on its inhabitants. And they brought the king word again.   

29. And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

30. And the king went up to the house of Jehovah and every man of Judah, and the people of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the inhabitants from the great to the small; and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant found in the house of Jehovah.

31. And the king stood in his place and made the covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart, and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that were written in this book.

32. And he made everyone who was found in Jerusalem and in Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to stand to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

33. And Josiah removed all the idols out of all the lands that belonged to the sons of Israel, and caused everyone who was found in Israel to serve, to serve Jehovah their God; all his days they did not turn away from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.  

## 2 Chronicles 35

1. And Josiah performed a Passover in Jerusalem to Jehovah, and they killed the passover offering on the fourteenth of the first month.

2. And he made stand the priests over their charges, and made them strong for the service of the house of Jehovah,

3. and said to the Levites who were teaching all Israel, who were sanctified to Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David the king of Israel built; it shall not be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God, and His people Israel,

4. and prepare by the house of your fathers, according to your courses, by the writing of David the king of Israel, and by the writing of his son Solomon,

5. and stand in the sanctuary, by the divisions of the house of the fathers of your brothers, the sons of the people, and the portion of the house of the father of the Levites;

6. and kill the passover offering and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of Jehovah, by the hand of Moses.

7. And Josiah lifted up to the sons of the people a flock of lambs and young goats, all for passover offerings, for everyone who was found, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand oxen; these were from the king's substance.

8. And his leaders lifted up for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers in the house of God, gave to the priest two thousand and six hundred for passover offerings, and three hundred oxen.

9. And Conaniah, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brothers; and Hashabiah, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, lifted up to the Levites five thousand for passover offerings, and five hundred oxen.

10. And the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the command of the king.

11. And they slaughtered the passover offering and the priests sprinkled out of their hand, and the Levites were stripping;

12. and they removed the burnt offering, to distribute them by the divisions of the house of the fathers of the sons of the people, to offer to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses, and so to the oxen.

13. And they roasted the passover with fire, according to the ordinance; and they cooked the holy things in pots, and in kettles, and in pans, and carried to all the sons of the people.

14. And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; for the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering up the burnt offering and the fat until nightfall; and the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests; the sons of Aaron.

15. And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to David's command, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the seer of the king; and the gatekeepers were at each gate; it was not for them to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.

16. And all the service of Jehovah was prepared on that day, to perform the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of king Josiah.

17. And the sons of Israel who were found performed the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread , seven days.

18. And there had not been a Passover performed like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; yea, none of the kings of Israel performed such a Passover as Josiah performed, and the priests, and the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

19. ln the eighteenth year of the Josiah's reign, this Passover was performed.   

20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho the king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out to meet him.

21. And he sent messengers to him, saying, What do I have to do with you, O king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but toward the house with which I have war; and God said for me to hasten; stop yourself from opposing God, who is with me, and He shall not destroy you.

22. Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself to fight against him, and did not listen to the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.

23. And the archers shot at king Josiah. And the king said to his servants, Pass me out, for I am severely wounded.

24. And his servants passed him out from the chariot, and caused him to ride in a second chariot of his, and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the graves of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning for Josiah.

25. And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singers and the songstresses speak in their lamentations of Josiah to this day, and set them as a statute in Israel; and behold, they are written in the Lamentations.

26. And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and godly deeds, are according as it is written in the law of Jehovah.

27. And his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.  

## 2 Chronicles 36

1. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king instead of his father in Jerusalem.

2. Jehoahaz was a son of twenty three years when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

3. And the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.

4. And the king of Egypt made his brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned about his name to Jehoiakim; and Necho took his brother Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt.

5. Jehoiakim was a son of twenty five years when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did the evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God.

6. Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze fetters to take him away to Babylon.

7. And Nebuchadnezzar brought some of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple in Babylon.

8. And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his evil deeds that he did, and that which was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.

9. Jehoiachin was a son of eight years when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days; and he did the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.

10. And at the turn of the year, king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the valuable vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made his kinsman Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.   

11. Zedekiah was a son of twenty one years when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

12. And he did the evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God; he was not humbled before Jeremiah the prophet, from the mouth of Jehovah.

13. And also he rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; and he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning to Jehovah the God of Israel.

14. Also, all the heads of the priests, and the people were continually acting treacherously according to all the abominable idols of the nations; and they defiled the house of Jehovah that He had sanctified in Jerusalem.

15. And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by the hand of His messengers, rising early and sending, for He had pity on his people and on His dwelling place.

16. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets until the wrath of Jehovah went up against His people, until there was no healing.

17. And He caused the king of the Chaldeans to go up against them; and he killed their choice ones by the sword in the house of their holy place, and had no pity on the young man and the virgin, the old man and the very aged; He gave all into his hand.

18. And all the vessels of the house of God, the large and the small, and treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and his leaders, he brought all to Babylon.

19. And they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem; and they burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its beautiful vessels.

20. And he removed to Babylon those who were left of the sword; and they were slaves to him and to his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia;

21. in order to fulfill the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths; all the days of the desolation it kept the sabbath, to the full measure of seventy years.   

22. And in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah awakened the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia, and he caused a voice to pass throughout all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,

23. So says Cyrus the king of Persia, Jehovah the God of the heavens has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has laid a charge on me to build a house in Jerusalem to Him, that is in Judah. Who is among you of all His people? May Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.
