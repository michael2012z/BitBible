# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.   

2. Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth! For Jehovah has spoken: I have nursed and brought up sons, but they have rebelled against Me.

3. The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's manger, but Israel does not know; My people have not understood.

4. Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have scorned the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged backward.

5. Why will you be stricken any more? Will you continue the revolt? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.

6. From the sole of the foot even to the head, no soundness is in it; only a wound and a stripe and a fresh blow; they have not been closed, nor bound up; nor was it softened with oil.

7. Your land is a desolation; your cities burned with fire. Foreigners devour your land before you; and behold , ruin, as overthrown by foreigners.

8. And the daughter of Zion is left a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.

9. Except Jehovah of hosts had left a remnant for us, a few, we would be as Sodom; we would be as Gomorrah.   

10. Hear the word of Jehovah, rulers of Sodom. Listen to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.

11. What good to Me are your many sacrifices, says Jehovah? I am full of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fattened cattle, and the blood of bulls; nor do I delight in the blood of lambs and he goats.

12. When you come to see My face, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?

13. Do not add to bringing vain sacrifice; its incense is an abomination to Me. I cannot endure the new moon and sabbath, the going to meeting, and the evil assembly.

14. My soul hates your new moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to Me. I am weary of bearing them .

15. And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. Yea, when you multiply prayer, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.   

16. Wash yourselves, purify yourselves. Put away the evil of your doings from My sight; stop doing evil.

17. Learn to do good, seek justice, reprove the oppressor, judge the orphan, strive for the widow.

18. Come now and let us reason together, says Jehovah: Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they are red as the crimson, they shall be like wool.

19. If you are willing and hear, you shall eat the good of the land.

20. But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.   

21. Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it. But now, murderers!

22. Your silver has become dross; your wine is diluted with water.

23. Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe, and is pursuing rewards. They do not judge the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come to them,

24. and says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Alas! I will be eased of My foes, and avenge Myself of My enemies.

25. And I will return My hand on you, and refine your dross, as with lye, and take away all your alloy.

26. And I will return your judges as at the first; and your advisors, as at the beginning; then you shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.

27. Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness.

28. And the ruin of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together. And those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.

29. For they shall be ashamed of the trees which you lusted after; and you shall be ashamed of the gardens that you have chosen.

30. For you shall be like a tree whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water in it.

31. And the strong shall be for tow, and his work for a spark; and they shall burn both together; and no one shall quench them .  

## Isaiah 2

1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:

2. And it shall be in the last days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow into it.

3. And many people shall go and say, Come and let us go up to the mount of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach from His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion the law will go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.

4. And He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.

5. Oh house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.   

6. For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled from the east, and are fortunetellers like the Philistines. And they clap hands with children of foreigners.

7. And his land is filled with silver and gold. There is no end of his treasures. And his land is full of horses; his chariots also do not have an end.

8. And his land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.

9. And man bowed down; and man was humbled, but You do not lift them up.   

10. Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from fear of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty.

11. The lofty eyes of man shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be bowed down; but Jehovah, He alone, will be exalted in that day.

12. For the day of Jehovah of Hosts shall be on all the proud and lofty ones, and on all that is lifted up; and it will be abased;

13. and against all Lebanon's cedars, high and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;

14. and against all the high mountains; and against all the lifted up hills;

15. and against every tall tower; and against every fortified wall;

16. and against all the ships of Tarshish; and on all pleasurable craft.

17. And the pride of man shall be humbled; and the loftiness of men shall be abased; and Jehovah alone will be exalted in that day.

18. And the idols shall completely vanish.

19. And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, for fear of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth quake.

20. ln that day a man shall throw his silver and his golden idols which they made for him to worship, to the hole of the burrower and to the bats;

21. to go into the crevices of the rocks, and into the clefts of the cliffs, from the dread of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth quake.

22. Cease yourself from man, whose breath is in his nostril, for in what is he to be esteemed?  

## Isaiah 3

1. For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, takes away the stay and the staff from Jerusalem and from Judah; the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water;

2. the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet; and the diviner and the elder;

3. the commander of fifty and the exalted of face; the counselor and the skilled craftsman; and the expert enchanter.

4. And I will give young boys to be their rulers, and caprices shall rule over them.

5. And the people shall be crushed, man against man, and a man on his neighbor. The boy will be insolent against the elder, and the despised against the honorable.

6. When a man shall take hold of his brother, at his father's house, saying , A cloak! Come, you be a ruler for is; let this ruin be under your hand.

7. In that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be one who binds up; for there is no bread nor a cloak in my house; you shall not make me a ruler of the people.

8. For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their deeds toward Jehovah are to rebel against the eyes of His glory.   

9. The look of their faces witnesses against them; they have declared their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it . Woe to their soul! For they have dealt evil to themselves.

10. Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.

11. Woe to the wicked! For the evil, the doing of his hand will be done to him.

12.  As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over him. Oh My people, your rulers cause you to go astray, and they swallow the way of your paths.

13. Jehovah stands up to plead His cause, and stands up to judge the peoples.

14. Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their kings. For you have eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses.

15. What do you mean that you crush My people, and grind the faces of the poor, says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts?   

16. And Jehovah says, Because the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet;

17. So Jehovah will make the crown of the daughter of Zion scabby; and Jehovah will lay their secret parts bare.

18. In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of the ankle bracelets, and the headbands, and the crescents,

19. the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;

20. the headdresses, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the houses of the soul, and the amulets;

21. the rings and nose jewels;

22. the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;

23. the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.

24. And it shall be, instead of a smell of perfume, there shall be an odor of decay. And instead of a sash, a rope. And instead of well set hair, baldness. And instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.

25. Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.

26. And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit bare on the ground.  

## Isaiah 4

1. And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing, only let your name be called on us; collect our shame.   

2. In that day the Branch of Jehovah will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth for pride and for glory for the survivors of Israel.

3. And it shall be, he remaining in Zion, and he who is left in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one who is written among the living in Jerusalem;

4. when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and the blood of Jerusalem shall have been rinsed away from its midst by a spirit of judgment, and by a spirit of burning.

5. Then Jehovah will create a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, over all the site of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies; for on all the glory will be a canopy.

6. And there shall be a booth for a shade from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a hiding place from storm and rain.  

## Isaiah 5

1. Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard: My Beloved has a vineyard in a fruitful horn.

2. And He dug it, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in its midst, and also hewed out a wine vat in it. And He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced rotten grapes.

3. And now, O people of Jerusalem and men of Judah, I ask you, judge between Me and My vineyard.

4. What more could have been done to My vineyard that I have not done in it? Who knows? I waited for it to yield grapes, but it yielded rotten grapes.

5. And now I will make known to you what I will do then to My vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it will be burned. I will breach its wall, and it will become a trampling ground.

6. And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds from raining rain on it.

7. For the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah is His delightful plant. And He waited for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, a cry!   

8. Woe to those touching house to house, bringing near field to field until the end of space, and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!

9. Jehovah of Hosts has sworn in my ears, If not, many houses shall be a waste, big and beautiful ones without inhabitant.

10. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.

11. Woe to those who rise early in the morning to go after fermented drink, tarrying in the twilight while wine inflames them!

12. And the lyre and the harp, the timbrel and flute, and wine are at their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Jehovah; yea, they do not see the work of His hands.

13. For this My people go into exile without knowledge, and his men of glory into famine; and his multitude is parched with thirst.

14. So Sheol has enlarged its appetite, and opened its mouth without measure, and her glory and her multitude, and her uproar, he who exults in her, shall come down in it.

15. And man is bowed down, and man is humbled, and the eyes of the proud are humbled.

16. But Jehovah of Hosts is exalted in judgment, and God the Holy One is proven holy in righteousness.

17. Then the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and strangers shall eat the waste places of the fatlings.   

18. Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with ropes of a cart;

19. who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work, so that we may see; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know!

20. Woe to those who say to evil, good; and to good, evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

21. Woe to those wise in their own eyes, and discerning in their own sight!

22. Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and brave men to mix fermented drink;

23. who justify the wicked for a bribe, and turn aside the righteousness of the righteous from him!

24. So, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and the flame burns up the chaff; their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the law of Jehovah of Hosts; and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

25. On account of this the anger of Jehovah is kindled on His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has struck them; and the mountains quaked, and their dead bodies were as filth in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is stretched out still.

26. And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will hiss to them from the ends of the earth; and, behold, it shall come with swift speed!

27. None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none will slumber nor sleep; nor shall the waist cloth of their loins be opened, nor the thong of their sandals broken;

28. whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hooves shall appear as flint, and their wheels like a hurricane.

29. Their roaring shall be like a lion; they shall roar like young lions. Yea, they roar and seize the prey, and carry it away; and no one shall deliver.

30. And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; when one looks to the land, and lo, darkness! Distress! And light shall be darkened by its clouds.  

## Isaiah 6

1. In the year that king Uzziah died, then I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up. And His train filled the temple.

2. Above it stood the seraphs. Each one had six wings; with two he covered his face; and with two he covered his feet; and with two he flew.

3. And one cried to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory!

4. And the doorposts shook from the voice of the one who cried; and the house was filled with smoke.   

5. Then I said, Woe is me! For I am cut off; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live amongst a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.

6. Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, snatched with tongs from the altar.

7. And he touched it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is covered.

8. And I heard the voice of Jehovah, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then I said, Behold me. Send me!   

9. And He said, Go and tell this people, Hearing you hear, but do not understand; and seeing you see, but do not know.

10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make his ears heavy, and shut his eyes, that he not see with his eyes, and hear with his ears, and understand with his heart, and turn back, and one heals him.

11. Then I said, Until when, O Lord? And He said, Until cities lie desolate without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land is laid waste, a desolation;

12. and until Jehovah has sent mankind far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.

13. But yet a tenth shall be in it, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak that in being felled yet has its stump (the holy seed is its stump).  

## Isaiah 7

1. And it happened in the days of Ahaz: the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but were not able to do battle against it.

2. And the house of David was told, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim, and his heart and the heart of his people shook, as the trees of the forest shake from the wind.

3. And Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shearjashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, to the highway of the Fuller's Field.

4. And say to him, Be on guard and be calm. Do not fear nor be timid of heart because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

5. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying,

6. Let us go up against Judah and make her to dread, and break her for ourselves, and set a king in her midst, the son of Tabeal.

7. So says the Lord Jehovah, It shall not rise, nor shall it happen.

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty five years Ephraim shall be broken from being a people.

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you will not be established.   

10. And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz:, saying,

11. Ask a sign from Jehovah your God; make deep the request, or make it high above.

12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt Jehovah.

13. And He said, Hear now, O house of David, is it too little that you weary men, but will you also weary my God?

14. So, The Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold! The virgin will conceive and will bring forth a son; and she shall call His name Immanuel.

15. He shall eat curds and honey until He knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.

16. For before the boy shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you hate will be forsaken before both her kings.   

17. Jehovah shall bring the king of Assyria on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days which have not come since the days Ephraim turned aside from Judah.

18. And it shall be, in that day Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee in the land of Assyria.

19. And they shall come, and they shall all rest in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thorn bushes, and in all the pastures.

20. In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired, Beyond the River, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and also it shall sweep away the beard.

21. And it shall be in that day, a man shall keep alive a heifer of the herd, and two sheep.

22. And it shall be, he shall eat curds from the plenty of milk making; for everyone who is left in the land shall eat curds and honey.

23. And it shall be in that day, every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall be for briers and thorns.

24. With arrows and with the bow, he shall come there; because all the land shall be briers and thorns.

25. And all the hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of the ox, and for trampling of sheep.  

## Isaiah 8

1. And Jehovah said to me, Take a big tablet and write in it with a man's pen: Make haste to plunder! Hasten to the prey!

2. And I took faithful witnesses to record for me, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

3. And I drew near the prophetess. And she conceived, and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name, Hurry, plunder! Eagerly plunder!

4. For before the boy knows to cry, My father, or, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

5. Jehovah also spoke to me again, saying,

6. Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, and rejoices in Rezin and Remaliah's son,

7. Behold, therefore the Lord also brings on them the channels of the River, mighty and many: the king of Assyria and all his glory. And he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.

8. And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over. He shall reach to the neck; and his wings will be stretching out, filling the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.   

9. O peoples, suffer evil, and be broken! And listen, all from the far places of the earth; gird yourselves, and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!

10. Counsel a counsel, and it is frustrated; speak a word, and it shall not rise; for God is with us.

11. For so Jehovah spoke to me with a strong hand, and taught me against walking in the way of this people, saying,

12. Do not say, A conspiracy, to everything of which this people says, A conspiracy! And do not fear its fear, and do not dread.

13. Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear; and let Him be your dread.

14. And He shall be for a sanctuary, and for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of falling to the two houses of Israel; for a trap and for a snare to the dweller of Jerusalem.

15. And many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.   

16. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.

17. And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for Him.

18. Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given to me are for signs and wonders in Israel from Jehovah of Hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.

19. And when they say to you, Seek to the mediums, and to wizards who peep and mutter; should not a people seek to its God, than for the living to seek to the dead?

20. To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no dawn to them!

21. And they shall pass through it, hard pressed and hungry. And it shall be, they shall be hungry; he will rave and curse his king and his God, and face upward.

22. And they shall look to the land. And, behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish; and they are driven to darkness.  

## Isaiah 9

1. Yet there shall not be gloom for which anguish is to her; as in the former time when He degraded the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, so afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

2. The people who walk in darkness have seen a great light. The ones who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, light has shone on them.

3. You have not multiplied the nation; You have not increased the joy. They rejoice before You as in the joy of, harvest, as men shout when they divide the plunder.

4. For You have broken his burdensome yoke and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.

5. For every boot of the trampler is with commotion, and a coat rolled in blood shall be burning fuel for the fire.

6. For a Child is born; to us a Son is given; and the government is on His shoulder; and His name is called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.

7. There is no end to the increase of His government and of peace on the throne of David, and on His kingdom, to order it, and to sustain it with justice and with righteousness, from now and forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will do this.   

8. The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has fallen into Israel.

9. And all the people shall know, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and greatness of heart,

10. Bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will use cedars instead.

11. And Jehovah will set up Rezin's foes against him, and spur on his enemies;

12. Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with all the mouth. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.

13. For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, and they do not seek Jehovah of Hosts.

14. And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.

15. The elder and the exalted of face; he is the head. And the prophet who teaches lies; he is the tail.

16. For this people's leaders led them astray, and its guided ones are swallowed up.

17. For this the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor have pit on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer; and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.

18. For wickedness burns like a fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle the thickets of the forest; and they shall roll upward, like the going up of smoke.

19. The land is scorched by the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall spare his brother.

20. And he shall cut off on the right hand, yet be hungry. And he shall eat on the left, but not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;

21. Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; together they are against Judah. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.  

## Isaiah 10

1. Woe to those who decree decrees of injustice, and writers who write toil;

2. to keep back the poor from judgment, and to steal justice from the poor of My people; that widows may be their prey; that they may rob orphans.

3. And what will you do in the day of visitation and of destruction? It comes from far away. To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?

4. Surely, he will grovel under the prisoners, and they will fall under the slain. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.   

5. Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And My fury is the staff in their hand.

6. I will send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to plunder, and to strip off spoil, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.

7. Yet he does not purpose this, nor does his heart think so. For it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.

8. For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?

9.  Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is Hamath not like Arpad? Is Samaria not like Damascus?

10. As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols (for their carved images excelled Jerusalem's and Samaria's);

11. shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?

12. And it will be, when the Lord has broken off all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will visit on the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and on the glory of his lofty eyes.

13. For he says, I have worked by the strength of my hand and by my wisdom; for I am wise. And I take away the borders of peoples, and have robbed their treasures. And like a mighty one, I subdue inhabitants.

14. And my hand has found the riches of the people. Like a nest, I also have gathered all the earth, as forsaken eggs are gathered. And there was not one moving a wing, or opening a mouth, or one chirping.

15. Shall the axe glorify itself over him chopping with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself over him moving it? As if a rod could wave those who lift it . As if a staff could raise what is not wood!

16. So the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones. And under His glory He will kindle a burning like the burning of fire.

17. And the Light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.

18. And He shall consume the glory of his forest and his fruitful field, even from soul to flesh; and it shall be as a sick man melts away.

19. And the rest of the trees of the forest shall be few, so that a boy might write them.   

20. And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel, and the escaped ones from the house of Jacob, shall not any more lean on him who struck him. But they will truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.

21. The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

22. For though Your people Israel is like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of it shall return; a determined end, overflowing with righteousness.

23. For the Lord Jehovah of Hosts is making a full end, even ordained, in the midst of all the land.   

24. So the Lord Jehovah of Hosts says this: Oh My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with the rod, and he shall lift up his staff against you in the way of Egypt.

25. But yet a little while, and the fury is finished; and My anger shall be over their destruction.

26. And Jehovah of Hosts shall stir up a whip on him, according to the striking of Midian at the rock Oreb; and as His rod was on the sea, and He lifted it up in the way of Egypt.

27. And it shall be in that day, his burden shall turn away from on your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

28. He has come to Aiath; he has passed to Migron; he has left his baggage at Michmash.

29. They have crossed the ford; they have bedded down at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul has fled.

30. Shriek with your voice, daughter of ruins; bow, Laish, afflicted of Anathoth.

31. Madmenah wanders; Gebim's inhabitants take refuge.

32. Yet he remains in Nob today; he will shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall lop the bough of terror! And the lofty ones shall be cut down, and the proud shall be humbled.

34. And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.  

## Isaiah 11

1. And a Shoot goes out from the stump of Jesse, and a Branch will bear fruit out of his roots.

2. And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest on Him; He will have the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and power, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.

3. And He is made to breathe in the fear of Jehovah. But He shall not judge by the seeing of His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears.

4. But He shall judge the poor in righteousness, and shall decide rightly for the meek of the earth. And He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and He shall slay the wicked with the breath of His lips.

5. And righteousness shall be the encircler of His loins, and faithfulness the encircler of His reins.

6. And the wolf shall live with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little boy shall lead them.

7. The cow and the bear shall feed, their young shall lie together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

8. And the infant shall play on the hole of the asp; yea, the weaned child shall put his hand on the viper's den.

9. They shall not do evil, nor destroy in all My holy mountain. For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.   

10. And it shall be in that day, the Root of Jesse stands as a banner of peoples; nations shall seek to Him; and His resting place shall be glory.

11. And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall again set His hand, the second time, to recover the remnant of His people that remains, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Ethiopia, and from Persia, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the coasts of the sea.

12. And He shall lift up a banner for the nations, and shall gather the outcasts of Israel, and gather those dispersed from Judah, from the four wings of the earth.

13. And the envy of Ephraim shall turn off; and Judah's foes shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not trouble Ephraim.

14. But they shall fly onto the shoulder of the Philistines to the west; together they shall plunder the sons of the east, the stretching of the hand on Edom and Moab and the sons of Ammon; they will obey them.

15. And Jehovah shall utterly destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt; and with His scorching wind He shall wave His hand over the River, and shall strike it into seven torrents, and make one tread it with shoes.

16. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, those left from Assyria, as it was to Israel in the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt.  

## Isaiah 12

1. And in that day you shall say, O Jehovah, I will thank You. Though You were angry with me, turn away Your anger and You shall comfort me.

2. Behold, God is my salvation! I will trust and not be afraid, for my strength and song is Jah Jehovah; yea, He has become my salvation.

3. And you shall draw waters out of the wells of salvation with joy.   

4. And in that day you shall say, Praise Jehovah! Call on His name; declare His doings among the peoples; make mention that His name is exalted.

5. Sing to Jehovah, for He has done majestically; this is known in all the earth.

6. Cry and shout, O dweller of Zion! For great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.  

## Isaiah 13

1. The burden of Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:

2. Lift up a banner on a bare mountain; make the voice rise to them; wave the hand that they may enter the gates of nobles.

3. I have commanded My holy ones; I have also called My warriors for My anger, those who rejoice in My highness.

4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people! A noise of tumult of the kingdoms of nations gathered together; Jehovah of Hosts is calling up an army for the battle.

5. They come from a distant land, from the end of the heavens, Jehovah and the weapons of His wrath, to destroy all the land.   

6. Howl! For the day of Jehovah is at hand. It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

7. On account of this all hands shall droop, and every heart of man shall melt;

8. and they shall be afraid. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain like a woman bearing; they shall be amazed, each man to his neighbor; faces of flames shall be their faces.

9. Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel and with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land waste. And He shall destroy its sinners out of it.

10. For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give light; the sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not reflect its light.

11. And I will visit evil on the world, and their iniquity on the wicked. And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease; and I will humble the pride of tyrants.

12. I will make a man more rare than fine gold; even a man more than the carvings of Ophir.

13. So I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall move out of its place, in the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.

14. And it shall be as a gazelle driven away, and as a sheep no one gathers; each man shall look to his own people, and each one shall flee to his land.

15. Everyone who is found shall be pierced through; yea, everyone who is sept away shall fall by the sword.

16. And their children shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be robbed, and their wives raped.

17. Behold! I stir up the Medes against them, who shall not value silver. And they shall not delight in gold.

18. And bows shall also smash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare sons.   

19. And Babylon, the glory of the kingdoms, the beauty of the pride of the Chaldeans, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It shall never be inhabited forever, nor shall it be lived in from generation to generation. And the Arabian shall not pitch a tent there, nor shall the shepherds make flocks lie down there.

21. But the desert creatures shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of howling creatures; and daughters of ostriches shall dwell there; and he goats shall skip there.

22. And hyenas shall cry along with his widows; and jackals in palaces of delight. Yea, her time to come is near, and her days shall not be prolonged.  

## Isaiah 14

1. For Jehovah will have pity on Jacob, and will yet choose among Israel, and set them in their own land. And the stranger shall be joined to them; and they shall cling to the house of Jacob.

2. And the peoples shall take them and bring them to their own place. And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of Jehovah for slaves and slave girls. And they shall be captives of their captors; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

3. And it shall be, in the day that Jehovah shall give you rest from your sorrow, and from your trouble, and from the hard bondage which was pressed on you,   

4. you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: How the exacter, the gold gatherer, has ceased!

5. Jehovah has broken the rod of the wicked, the staff of rulers,

6. who struck the peoples in wrath, a blow without turning away, ruling the nations in anger, dealing out persecution without restraint.

7. All the earth is at rest, quiet; they break forth into singing.

8. Yea, the fir trees rejoice over you; the cedars of Lebanon say , Since you have lain down, no woodcutter will come up against us.

9. Sheol from below is stirred for you, to meet you at your coming; it stirs up the departed spirits for you, all the he goats of the earth. It has raised all the kings of the nations from their thrones.

10. All of them shall answer and say to you, Are you also made as weak as we? Are you likened to us?

11. Your majesty is lowered into Sheol; the noise of your harps. The maggot is spread under you; yea, the worms cover you.

12. Oh shining star, son of the morning, how you have fallen from the heavens! You weakening the nations, you are cut down to the ground.

13. For you have said In your heart, I will go up to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit in the mount of meeting, in the sides of the north.

14. I will rise over the heights of the clouds; I will be compared to the Most High.

15. Yet you shall be brought out to Sheol, to the sides of the Pit.

16. They that see you shall stare and closely watch you, saying , Is this the man who made the earth tremble, shaking kingdoms,

17. making the world like a wilderness, and who tore down its cities; he did not open a house for his prisoners?

18. All kings of nations, all of them lie in glory, each man in his house.

19. But you are thrown from your grave like a despised branch, like the covering of the slain, those pierced by the sword, those who go down into the stones of the Pit, like a dead body trampled under foot.

20. You shall not be united with them in burial, because you ruined your land; you have slain your people; the seed of evildoers shall never be named.

21. Prepare for the slaughter of his sons, for the iniquity of their fathers; that they may not rise and possess the land and fill the face of the earth with cities.

22. For I will rise against them, says Jehovah of Hosts, and cut off the name and remnant, the son and grandson, from Babylon, declares Jehovah.

23. Also I will make it a possession of the hedgehog and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the broom of ruin, says Jehovah of Hosts.   

24. Jehovah of Hosts has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall be; and as I have purposed, it shall rise up;

25. to break Assyria in My land, and trample him on My mountains. Then his yoke shall depart from them, and his burden shall depart from his shoulders.

26. This is the purpose that is purposed on all the earth; and this the hand that is stretched out on all the nations.

27. For Jehovah of Hosts has purposed. And who shall reverse it ? And His hand is stretched out. Who shall turn it back?

28. This burden was in the year king Ahaz died:

29. Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, for the rod of your striking is broken, because a viper comes forth from the root of a snake, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

30. And the first-born of the poor shall eat; and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine; and it shall kill your remnant.

31. Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! Philistia is melted away, all of you. For a smoke comes from the north, and not one is alone in his ranks.

32. What then shall one answer to the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah has founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall trust in it.  

## Isaiah 15

1. The burden of Moab: Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off; because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off.

2. One goes up to the house, even to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba; all its heads shall be bald, every beard shorn.

3. They shall dress with sackcloth in the streets; everyone shall howl on their housetops and in their plazas, melting in tears.

4. And Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz; so the warriors of Moab shall shout; his life is broken to him.

5. My heart shall cry to Moab; her fugitives to Zoar, a heifer of three years; he goes up the ascent of Luhith with weeping, for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of ruin.   

6. For Nimrim's waters are desolations; for the hay is dried up; the grass fails; there is not a green thing.

7. On account of this one made up the remainder, and their store; they shall carry them over the torrent of the willows.

8. For the cry has gone around Moab's borders; his howling even to Eglaim; and his howling even to the Well of Elim.

9. For Dimon's waters are full of blood; for I will put more on Dimon, a lion on him who escapes from Moab, and for the remnant of the land.  

## Isaiah 16

1. Send a lamb to the ruler of the land, from the rock of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Zion.

2. For it is as a fleeing bird cast out of the nest; the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

3. Take counsel; do judgment; make your shadow as the night in midday; hide the outcasts; do not uncover the fugitive!

4. Let My outcasts tarry with you, Moab. Be a hiding place to them from the face of the destroyer. For the exacter has ceased, destruction has failed; the trampler is ended out of the land.

5. And in mercy the throne shall be founded; and he shall sit on it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking justice, and swift in righteousness.   

6. We have heard of the pride of Moab, very proud; of his pride, his arrogance, and his rage; not so are his babblings.

7. So Moab shall howl for Moab; everyone shall howl; all of it shall howl for the foundations of Kir-hareseth; surely they are stricken.

8. For the fields of Heshbon droop, the vine of Sibmah. The masters of the nations have crushed its choice plants. They have come to Jazer; they wander in the desert; her branches are spread out; they have crossed the sea.

9. On account of this I will weep with the weeping of Jazer, the vine of Sibmah; I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for shouting has fallen on your fruit and on your harvest.

10. And gladness and joy is gathered up from the fruitful field; and there is no singing and no shouting in the vineyards; the treaders shall not tread out wine in the presses; I have made the exultation to cease.

11. For this reason my belly shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-haresh.

12. And it shall be, when it is seen that Moab shall be wearied on the high place, then he shall come to his shrine to pray, and he shall not be able.

13. This is the word that Jehovah had spoken to Moab from that time.

14. But now Jehovah has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, then the glory of Moab will be abased, with all the great host; and the remnant shall be few; small, not mighty.  

## Isaiah 17

1. The burden of Damascus: Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruined heap.

2. The cities of Aroer are forsaken; now they are for flocks; they lie down and no one terrifies them .

3. And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim; and the kingdom from Damascus and the rest of Syria. They shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel, declares Jehovah of Hosts.

4. And it shall be in that day, Jacob's glory shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall be made lean.

5. And it shall be as the reaping of the harvest grain, and his arm reaps the ears. And it shall be as he who gathers ears in the Valley of the Giants.   

6. Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree; two or three ripe olives in the top of the uppermost branch; four or five in the fruit tree branches, declares Jehovah God of Israel.

7. In that day a man shall gaze to his Maker; and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.

8. And he shall not gaze to the altars, the work of his hands; and he will not see what his fingers have made, even the Asherahs, and the sun pillars.   

9. In that day his fortified cities shall be as a thing left in the forest, or the branch that they leave, from before the sons of Israel. And it will become a desolation.

10. Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and you did not remember the Rock of your strength. On account of this you shall plant pleasing plants, and shall sow it a foreign shoot.

11. In the day of your planting you fence it in; in the morning you make your seed sprout; the harvest is a heap in the day of sickness and incurable pain.   

12. Woe to the multitude of many peoples; they roar like the roar of seas; and the crash of nations, they crash like the crash of mighty waters!

13. The nations shall crash like the crashing of many waters, but He rebukes it, and it flees far away; yea, it is driven like the chaff of mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before a tempest.

14. At the time of evening, behold, terror! Before it is morning, it shall not be . This is the portion of those robbing us, and the lot of those plundering us.  

## Isaiah 18

1. Woe to the land of whirring of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;

2. which sends envoys by the sea, even in ships of papyrus on the face of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a dreadful people from it and onwards; and a nation mighty and trampling down, whose land the rivers have divided!

3. All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers of the earth, as one lifts a banner on the peaks, you will see. And you will hear as the blowing of a ram's horn.

4. For so Jehovah said to me, I will rest, and I will watch My dwelling place; as the glowing heat on light; as the cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

5. For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and cut down and take away the branches.

6. They shall be left together to the birds of the hills, and to the beasts of the earth. And the birds shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.

7. Then shall be brought in that time to Jehovah of Hosts a present from a tall and smooth people, and a terrifying people, from it and onward; a mighty and trampling nation whose land the rivers have divided, to the place of the name of Jehovah of Hosts: Mount Zion.  

## Isaiah 19

1. The burden of Egypt: Behold! Jehovah rides on a light cloud and comes into Egypt. And the idols of Egypt shall tremble from before Him; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its midst.

2. And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians; and they each man shall fight against his brother; and each against his neighbor; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

3. And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be empty in its midst; and I will swallow its counsel. And they shall seek to idols, and to the enchanters, and to the mediums, and to the knowing ones.

4. And I will shut up the Egyptians into the hand of cruel lords; and a fierce king shall rule them, declares the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.

5. And the waters shall dry up from the sea, and the river shall fail and dry up.

6. And rivers shall be fouled; and the Nile of Egypt will languish and dry up; the reed and the rush shall decay.

7. Bare places shall be at the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile, and everything sown by the Nile shall dry up, driven away, and be no more.

8. The fishermen shall mourn; and all who cast a hook into the Nile shall wall; and those who spread nets on the surface of the waters shall droop.

9. And the workers in fine flax, and the weavers of white cloth are ashamed.

10. And her supports shall be crushed; and all who make wages shall be sad of soul.

11. Surely the rulers of Zoan are fools; the advice of Pharaoh's wise counselors has become stupid. How can you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of wise ones, the son of kings of old?

12. Where are your wise ones now? Yea, let them tell you now, that they may know what Jehovah of Hosts has planned against Egypt.

13. The rulers of Zoan are fools; the rulers of Noph are deceived; they also have led Egypt astray, the cornerstone of her tribes.

14. Jehovah has mixed a perverse spirit in her midst; and they led astray Egypt in all his work; as a drunkard strays in his vomit.

15. And Egypt shall have no work that the head or the tail, the branch or rush, may do.

16. In that day Egypt shall be like women; and it will tremble and dread from before the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of Hosts, which He shakes over it.

17. And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it shall dread to it, from before the purpose of Jehovah of Hosts, which He purposes against it.   

18. In that day five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of Hosts. One shall be called, City of Ruin.

19. Then an altar to Jehovah shall be in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at its border.

20. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry to Jehovah because of the oppressors; and He shall send them a deliverer, even a great one, and will deliver them.

21. And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt. Egypt shall know Jehovah in that day. And they shall offer sacrifice and offering, and vow a vow to Jehovah, and repay it .

22. And Jehovah shall strike Egypt. He shall strike and heal. Then they shall return to Jehovah, and He shall hear them, and shall heal them.

23. In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria. And Assyria shall come into Egypt; and Egypt into Assyria; and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.

24. In that day Israel shall be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,

25. whom Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be My people Egypt, and Assyria, the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.  

## Isaiah 20

1. In the year Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod, and took it;

2. at that time Jehovah spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loosen the sackcloth from your loins, and take your shoe off from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

3. And Jehovah said, Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years (a sign and a wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia)

4. so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old; naked and barefoot, and with uncovered buttocks; to the nakedness of Egypt.

5. And they shall be afraid and ashamed of their hope Ethiopia, and of their glory Egypt.

6. And he who lives in this coast shall say in that day, Behold, this has become of our hope to which we fled for help there, to be delivered from before the king of Assyria; and, How shall we escape?  

## Isaiah 21

1. The burden of the desert of the sea: As tempests in the Negeb pass, it comes from the desert from a terrifying land.

2. A harsh vision is revealed to me; the deceiver deals deceitfully, and the plunderer plunders. Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! I have caused all her sighing to cease.

3. Because of this my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold on me like the pangs of a travailing woman. I am bowed from hearing; I am troubled from seeing.

4. My heart wanders; terror overwhelms me; He has turned the twilight of my pleasure into trembling.

5. Prepare the table; watch in the watchtower; eat, drink; rise up, rulers, and anoint the shield.

6. For so the Lord has said to me: Go, set a watchman; he will declare what he sees.

7. And he sees a chariot, a couple of horsemen; a chariot of an ass; a chariot of a camel; and let him bow attentively, very attentively.

8. And he cried, A lion! My lord, I always stand on my watchtower by day; and I am stationed at my post all the nights.

9. And, behold, here comes a chariot of a man, a pair of horses. And he answered and said, Babylon has fallen, has fallen! And He has smashed the cut images of her gods to the earth.

10. Oh my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard of Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have told to you.   

11. The burden of Dumah: He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

12. The watchman says, The morning comes, and also night. If you would inquire, inquire. Come! Return!   

13. The burden of Arabia: You shall stay in the forest of Arabia, O traveling companies of Dedanites.

14. The people of the land of Tema bring water to him who is thirsty; they went to meet the fugitive with his bread.

15. For they fled from before swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the press of battle.

16. For so the Lord has said to me, Within a year, as the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall be ended,

17. and the rest of the number of the archers, the warriors of the sons of Kedar, shall be few. For Jehovah God of Israel has spoken.  

## Isaiah 22

1. The burden of the valley of vision: What ails you now, that you have gone up to the housetops?

2. Crashings fill the noisy city, the joyous city. Your slain ones are not slain by the sword, nor dead in battle.

3. All your rulers fled together; they were bound without the bow; all found in you were bound together; they have fled from afar.

4. On account of this I said, look away from me; I will weep bitterly; do not hurry to comfort me over the ruin of the daughter of my people.

5. for it is a day of trouble, and of trampling down, and of perplexity, by the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, in the valley of vision; digging down a wall, and crying to the mountain.

6. And Persia carried the quiver with a chariot of a man and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.

7. And it happened; your choicest valleys were full of chariots; and the horsemen surely set in order at the gate.   

8. And he removed Judah's covering; and you looked in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.

9. You have also seen the breaks in the city of David, that they are many; and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.

10. And you have counted the houses of Jerusalem; and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.

11. And you made a reservoir between the walls, for the water of the old pool. But you have not looked to its Maker, nor did you see its Former from long ago.

12. And in that day the Lord Jehovah of Hosts called to weeping and mourning; and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.

13. Then, lo, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and slaughtering sheep; eating flesh and drinking wine, saying, Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!

14. And Jehovah of Hosts revealed in my ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be covered for you until you die, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.   

15. So says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, Go! Go to this treasurer, to Shebna who is over the house.

16. What is to you here? And who is here to you, that you have carved a tomb for yourself here, as one having cut out his tomb on high, having carved out a home for himself in the rock?

17. Behold, Jehovah hurls you with a hurling, O man, and grasps you with a grasping.

18. Whirling, He will whirl you like a ball, into a land wide of hands. You shall die there, and there are the chariots of your glory, the shame of your lord's house.

19. And I will drive you from your position, and he will pull you from your station.

20. And in that day it shall be, even I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.

21. And I will clothe him with your robe and will fasten your sash on him. And I will give your authority into his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

22. And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder, so that he opens, and no one shuts; and he shuts, and no one opens.

23. And I will drive him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

24. And they shall hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the offshoots, all small vessels, from vessels of cups even to all vessels of jars.

25. In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, the nail that is driven in the sure place shall be removed, and be cut down, and fall. And the burden that was on it shall be cut off. Jehovah has spoken.  

## Isaiah 23

1. The burden of Tyre: Howl, ships of Tarshish! For it is ruined, without house, without entrance. It is revealed to them from the land of Kittim.

2. Be still, inhabitants of the coast, trader of Sidon crossing the sea; they have filled you.

3. And by great waters, the seed of Sihor and the harvest of the river Nile was her revenue; and she a mart of nations.

4. Be ashamed, Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the strength of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, I have not nourished young men nor raised up virgins.

5. As the report comes to Egypt, so they shall be grieved at the report of Tyre.

6. Pass over Tarshish; howl, people of the coast!

7.  Is this your exulting city from days of her old age? Her own feet carry it far away to stay.

8. Who has purposed this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are rulers, whose traders are the weighty of the earth?

9. Jehovah of Hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring all the honored of the earth into contempt.

10. Pass through your land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more strength.

11. He stretched His hand over the sea; He shook kingdoms. Jehovah has made a decree against the merchant city , to destroy its forts.

12. And He said, You shall rejoice no more, oppressed one, virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Cyprus, even there is no rest to you.

13. Behold, the land of the Chaldeans! This people did not exist! Assyria founded it for those who live in the desert. They set up their siege towers; they stripped its palaces. They made it a ruin.

14. Howl, ships of Tarshish! For your fortress is ruined.   

15. And it shall be in that day that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will be as the song of a harlot to Tyre.

16. Take a harp; go about the city, O forgotten harlot. Do well to play; make many songs, that you may be remembered.

17. And it will be, after the end of seventy years, Jehovah will visit Tyre; and she shall return to her hire, and will fornicate with all the kingdoms of the earth, on the face of the earth.

18. And her goods and her wages shall be holiness to Jehovah; it shall not be hoarded nor stored; for her goods shall be for those who dwell before Jehovah, to eat enough, and for a choice covering.  

## Isaiah 24

1. Lo, Jehovah empties the land and makes it bare, and distorts its face, and scatters its inhabitants.

2. And as it is with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with the master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.

3. The land shall completely be emptied and utterly stripped, for Jehovah has spoken this word.

4. The land mourns and languishes; the world droops and languishes; the proud people of the earth droop.

5. And the earth is profaned under its inhabitants, because they transgress laws and violate a statute, and break the everlasting covenant.

6. On account of this a curse has devoured the land; and they who live in it are held guilty. For this the dwellers of the land are consumed, and few men are left.

7. The new wine has failed; the vine droops; all the merry-hearted sigh.

8. The joy of timbrels ceases; the noise of those who revel ends; the joy of the harp ceases.

9. They shall not drink wine with a song; fermented drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.

10. The city of shame is broken down; every house is shut, that no one may enter.

11. A crying over the wine is in the streets; all joy is darkened; the gladness in the land is carried away.

12. Desolation is remaining in the city, and a ruin; the gate is battered.   

13. For it is thus in the midst of the land, among the peoples, it shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as gleanings when the grape harvest is completed.

14. They lift up their voice; they sing for the majesty of Jehovah; they cry aloud from the sea.

15. On account of this, glorify Jehovah in the flames, the name of Jehovah God of Israel, in the coasts of the sea.   

16. We have heard songs from the end of the earth, Honor to the Righteous. But I said, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! Traitors betray, even perfidy; traitors betray!

17. Dread, and the pit, and a snare are upon you, dweller of the earth.

18. And it shall be, he who flees from the sound of dread shall fall into the pit. And he who comes up out of the middle of the pit shall be taken in the snare. For the windows from on high are opened, and the earth's foundations quake.

19. The earth is breaking, breaking! The earth is crashing, crashing! The earth is tottering, tottering.

20. Like a drunkard, the earth is staggering, staggering! And it rocks to and fro like a hut. And its trespass is heavy on it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

21. And it shall be in that day, Jehovah shall punish the army of the high place on high, and on the kings of the land on the land.

22. And they will be gathered, a gathering of prisoners in a dungeon. And they shall be shut up in a prison; and after many days they will be visited.

23. Then the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, when Jehovah of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; and before His elders is His glory .  

## Isaiah 25

1. O Jehovah, You are my God. I will exalt You; I will thank Your name; for You have done a wonderful thing: counsels from afar; faithful faithfulness.

2. Because You have made a heap from a city, a fortified city into a ruin; a citadel of foreigners not to be a city, not to be built, to forever.

3. For this the mighty people glorify You, the city of the ruthless nations shall fear You.

4. For You are a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from storm, a shadow from heat; because the breath of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall.

5. You shall lay low the noise of foreigners, like the heat in a dry place, the heat with the shadow of cloud; the shouting of the terrifying ones shall be laid low.   

6. And Jehovah of Hosts shall make a feast of fat things for all the peoples in this mountain; a feast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, refined wine on the lees.

7. And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering which covers all people, and the veil that is woven over all nations.

8. He will swallow up death in victory! And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces. And He shall reprove the reproach of His people from all the earth; for Jehovah has spoken   

9. And one shall say in that day, Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is Jehovah; we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.

10. For the hand of Jehovah shall rest in this mountain; and Moab shall be trampled under Him, even as straw is trampled in the water of a dung pit.

11. And He shall spread His hands in his midst, as he who swims strokes to swim. And He shall lay low his pride with the skill of His hands.

12. And He shall bow down the fortress of the height of your walls; He will lay low, touch to the earth, even to the dust.  

## Isaiah 26

1. In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: A strong city is ours; He sets up salvation as our walls and rampart.

2. Open the gates, and the righteous nation shall come in, keeping faithfulness.

3. You will keep in perfect peace the mind stayed on You , for he trusts in You.

4. Trust in Jehovah forever, for in Jah Jehovah is everlasting strength.   

5. For He bows the dwellers on high; He lays low the lofty city; He lays it low to the ground; He makes it touch even to the dust.

6. The foot shall trample it, the feet of the poor, steps of the weak.

7. The path for the just is uprightness. Upright One, level the track of the just.

8. Yea, Jehovah, in the path of Your judgments we awaited You; for Your name and for Your memory is the desire of our soul.

9.  With my soul I desire You in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I diligently seek You. For when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

10. The wicked finds favor; he does not learn righteousness; he deals perversely in the land of honesty, and does not see the majesty of Jehovah.

11. Jehovah, Your hand is high; they do not see; they see, and are ashamed of the zeal of the people. Yea, the fire of Your foes devours them.   

12. Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us; for also You have worked all our works for us.

13. Jehovah our God, masters beside You have governed us; only in You we will mention Your name.

14. Dead ones do not live; departed spirits do not rise; because of this You visited and destroyed them, and caused all memory of them to perish.

15. You have added to the nation, Jehovah; You have added to the nation, You are glorified; You have extended all the ends of the land.

16. Jehovah, they visited You in distress; they poured out a whisper; Your chastening was to them.

17. As a pregnant woman draws near to bear, she writhes and cries out in her pangs. So are we before You, Jehovah.

18. We conceived; we writhe; as it were, we gave birth to wind. We have not worked salvation for the earth; and the world's inhabitants have not fallen.

19. Your dead ones shall live, my dead body, they shall rise up. Awake and sing, dust dwellers; for the dew of lights is your dew; and the earth shall cast out departed spirits.   

20. Come, My people, go in your rooms and shut your doors behind you. Hide for a little moment, until the fury passes.

21. For, behold, Jehovah comes out of His place to visit his iniquity on the dweller of the earth. The earth shall also reveal her blood, and shall no more cover over her slain ones.  

## Isaiah 27

1. In that day Jehovah shall visit the sea monster, the darting serpent, with His great and fierce and strong sword; even on the sea monster, the twisting serpent; and He shall slay the monster that is in the sea.

2. In that day sing to it, A vineyard of desire;

3. I, Jehovah, keep it; I will water it every moment, that no one punish it; I will guard it night and day.

4. Fury is not in Me. Who will give Me briers and thorns in the battle? I will step through it; I would burn it at once.

5. Or will he lay hold of My strength that he may make peace with Me? Let him make peace with Me.

6. Those who come to Jacob, He shall make take root. Israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit.   

7.  As the striking of His striker, did He strike him? Or as the slaying of His slain, is he slain?

8. You will contend with her by driving her away, by sending her away. He shall take away by His harsh wind, in the day of the east wind.

9. By this, then, the iniquity of Jacob will be covered, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces; Asherahs and sun pillars shall not rise.

10. For the fortified city shall be lonely, a forsaken pasture, and left like a wilderness. The calf shall feed there, and he shall lie there, and eat up its branches.

11. When its boughs dry up, they are broken off. Women shall come and burn them, for it is a people with no understanding. On account of this His Maker shall not pity him, and His Former will not favor him.

12. And it shall be in that day, Jehovah shall thresh from the channel of the River to the torrent of Egypt; and you shall be gathered one by one, sons of Israel.

13. And it shall be in that day, the great ram's horn shall be blown; and those perishing in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.  

## Isaiah 28

1. Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower on the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome with wine!

2. Behold, the Lord is a mighty and strong one; like a hailstorm, a destroying storm; like a storm of mighty waters overflowing; He sets down to the earth by hand.

3. The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trampled down.

4. And the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower, like the first ripe fig before summer which the seeing one sees; while it is yet in his hand, he swallows it.

5. In that day Jehovah of Hosts shall become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the rest of His people,

6. and a spirit of justice to him who sits on the judgment seat; and for might to those turning back the battle toward the gate.

7. But they also have gone astray by wine, and have erred through fermented drink; priest and prophet have erred through fermented drink; they have been swallowed by wine; they strayed from fermented drink; they err in seeing; they stumble in judgment;

8. for all tables are full of vomit and filth, without a clean place.   

9. Whom shall He teach knowledge? And to whom shall He explain the message? Those weaned from milk, those moving from breasts?

10. For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.

11. For with stammering lip and another tongue, He will speak to this people;

12. to whom He said, This is the rest; cause the weary to rest. Also, This is the repose. But they willed not to hear.

13. Yet the word of Jehovah was to them, precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they might go, and stumble, and be broken, and snared, and taken.   

14. So hear the word of Jehovah, scornful men, rulers of this people in Jerusalem.

15. Because you have said, We have cut a covenant with death; and, We have made a vision with Sheol, when the overwhelming rod passes through it will not come to us for we have made the lie our refuge, and we have hidden in falsehood.

16. So, the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I place in Zion a Stone for a foundation, a tried Stone, a precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation; he who believes shall not hurry.

17. And I will lay justice for a line, and righteousness for a plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of the lie; and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

18. And your covenant with death shall be covered; and your vision with Sheol shall not rise up. When the overwhelming whip passes through, then you shall be for a trampling to it.

19. As often as it passes, it shall take you; for morning by morning it shall pass; and by day and by night, it shall only be a terror to understand the message.

20. For the bed is shorter than one can stretch himself on; and the cover is narrower than one can wrap himself in.

21. For Jehovah shall rise up, as at Mount Perazim; He shall be stirred as in the Gibeon Valley; to do His work, His strange work; and to perform His task, His alien task.

22. So, then, do not be mockers, that your bonds not be made strong. For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of Hosts that a full end is decreed on all the earth.   

23. Listen and hear My voice; pay attention and hear My word:

24. Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he open and break the clods of his ground?

25. When he has leveled its surface, does he not strew black cummin, and scatter cummin, and place wheat in rows, and barley in its place, and spelt in its border?

26. And He instructs him for the right; his God teaches him.

27. For black cummin is not threshed with the sledge; nor is a cartwheel turned on cummin. But black cummin is beaten out with the staff, and cummin with the rod.

28. Bread is crushed, but not always does one thresh it with threshing; and he drives the wheel of his cart; and his horses do not beat it small.

29. This also comes from Jehovah of Hosts, doing wonders in counsel, making sound wisdom great.  

## Isaiah 29

1. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David camped. Add year on year; let feasts run their circle.

2. Then I will compress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and sorrow; and it shall be to Me as Ariel.

3. And I will camp as a circle on you, and will lay siege work on you; and I will raise up ramparts on you.

4. And you shall be brought low; you shall speak from the ground; and your speech shall be bowed down; and your voice shall be from the ground, like a spiritist; and your speech shall chirp out of the dust.

5. And the host of your strangers shall be as fine powder, and as chaff passing, the host of terrifying ones; and it will be suddenly, instantly;

6. you shall he visited from Jehovah of Hosts; with thunder and earthquake, and great noise, tempest and storm, and flame of devouring fire.

7. And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, even all battling her and compressing her and her stronghold, shall be like a dream of a night vision.

8. It shall even be as when a hungry one dreams; and, behold, he is eating; but when he awakes, his soul is empty. Or it shall be as when a thirsty one dreams; and, behold, he is drinking, but when he awakes, he is faint, and his soul is longing. So shall be the multitude of all the nations who fight against Mount Zion.   

9. Wait and wonder! Blind yourselves, and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine! They stagger, but not with fermented drink!

10. for Jehovah has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes. He has covered the prophets and your heads, the seers.

11. And the whole vision to you is like the words of a sealed hook which they give to one knowing books, saying, Please read this. Then he says, I am not able, for it is sealed.

12. And the hook is given to one who does not know books, saying, Please read this. Then he says, I do not know books.

13. And the Lord says, Because this people draws near with its mouth, and they honor Me with its lip; but its heart is far from Me, and their fear of Me is taught by the command of men;

14. So, behold, I am adding to do a wonders with this people, the wonder, even a wonder. For the wisdom of his wise ones shall perish, and the wit of his witty ones shall be hidden.

15. Woe to those who go deep to hide their purposes from Jehovah; yea, their works are in the dark; and they say, Who sees us? And, Who knows us?

16. Oh your perversity! Shall the former be counted as the clay? For shall the work of its maker say, He did not make me? Or shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, He does not understand?   

17.  Is it not yet a little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field shall be counted for the forest?

18. And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book; and the eyes of the blind shall see out of their gloom and out of darkness.

19. And the humble ones shall increase joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

20. For the terrible one is brought to nothing; and the scorner is ended; and all that watch for evil are cut off;

21. those who make a man sin by a word, even laying a trap for the reprover in the gate, and turn aside the just for a worthless thing.

22. So Jehovah says this: He who redeemed Abraham, as to the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not be ashamed now, nor shall his face become pale now.

23. But when he sees his children in his midst, the work of My hands, they shall sanctify My name. They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

24. Those who erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmured shall learn the teaching.  

## Isaiah 30

1. Woe to rebellious sons, declares Jehovah, to make counsel, but not from Me; and to weave a covering web, but not of My Spirit, in order to add sin on sin;

2. who set out to go down to Egypt, but have not asked at My mouth, to take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt.

3. And the stronghold of Pharaoh shall become a shame to you; and relying on the shadow of Egypt shall be a disgrace.

4. For his rulers were in Zoan, and his ambassadors reached to Hanes.

5. Every one is ashamed over a people who do not profit them; they are not for a help, and not for profiting, but for a shame; yea, also for a reproach.

6. The burden of the beasts of the south: Into the land of trouble and constraint. The lioness and the lion are from them; the viper and fiery flying serpent. They carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who cannot profit them .

7. And Egypt; vainly and emptily they help. So I have called to this: Their strength is to sit still.   

8. Now come, write it before them on a tablet, and note it on a book, so that it may be for the latter day, until forever;

9. that this is a rebellious people, lying sons; sons who are not willing to hear the law of Jehovah;

10. who say to the seers, Do not see; and to visioners, Do not have a vision for right things to us; speak smooth things to us; have a vision of trifles.

11. Turn aside from the way; stretch from the path; cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

12. For this reason, so says the Holy One of Israel, Because of your rejection of this word, and your trust in oppression and perversity, even resting on it;

13. So this iniquity shall be to you as a broken section falling, like the bulging out of a high wall, the breaking of which comes suddenly, in an instant.

14. And its smashing is as the smashing of a potter's vessel; when broken in pieces, he has no pity; for in its breaking there is not found a shard to carry fire from the hearth, nor to skim water from a well.

15. For so says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest you shall be saved; and in quietness and hope shall be your strength. But you were not willing.

16. For you said, No! For we will flee on horseback. On account of this you shall flee. Also, you say , We will ride on swift ones. On account of this, those who pursue you shall be swift.

17. One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one. You shall flee from the rebuke of five, until you are left like a pole on the top of the mountain, and like a sign on a hill.   

18. And so Jehovah waits to be gracious to you. And for this He is exalted to have mercy on you; for Jehovah is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for Him.

19. For the people shall live in Zion, at Jerusalem; you shall surely cry no more. He surely will be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. When He hears, He will answer you.

20. And the Lord gives you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction; but your teachers shall not be hidden any more; but your eyes shall be to see your teachers.

21. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, this is the way, walk in it, when you go right, or when you go left.

22. And you shall defile the covering of your carved images of silver; and the covering of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them out like a menstruous cloth; you shall say to it, Go away!

23. Then He shall give rain for your seed, with which you sow the ground. And the bread of the produce of the earth also shall be fat and plentiful. In that day your livestock shall feed in a pasture made wide.

24. Also, the oxen and the young asses that till the ground shall eat seasoned fodder which one winnows with the shovel and with the fork.

25. And on every high mountain, and on every high hill, shall be rivulets lifted up, streams of water, in a day of great slaying, when towers fall.

26. And the moonlight shall be like the light of the sun. And the sun's light shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day of binding up, Jehovah binding the break of His people, and healing the wound of His blow.   

27. Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from afar; His anger burns; and is heavy as the uplifting of smoke ; His lips are full of fury, and His tongue like a devouring fire.

28. And like an overflowing torrent, His breath shall divide to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity, and a misleading bridle on the jaws of the peoples.

29. The song shall be to you, as the night when the feast is sanctified, and gladness of heart, as one going with the flute, to come into the mount of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.

30. And Jehovah shall make the majesty of His voice heard; and He shows His arm coming down with raging anger and flame of consuming fire, cloudburst and storm, and hailstones.

31. For through the voice of Jehovah, Assyria shall be crushed, the rod with which He strikes.

32. And every passage of the appointed staff that Jehovah causes to rest on him will be with timbrels and with harps. And in brandishing battles He fights with her.

33. For Topheth is ordained from yesterday. Also, it is prepared for the king; He deepened; He widened its pyre; He makes great with fire and wood. The breath of Jehovah burns in it like a torrent of brimstone.  

## Isaiah 31

1. Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and lean on horses, and trust on chariotry, because it is great; and in horsemen because they are very strong! But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek Jehovah.

2. And He also is wise, and brings evil, and will not turn aside His words, but will rise against the house of evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.

3. And Egypt is a man, and not God. And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. And Jehovah stretches out His hand, and both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall; and they shall all cease together.

4. For so Jehovah has said to me: As the lion roars, even the young lion on his prey when the multitude of shepherds are gathered against him, he will not fear their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise. So Jehovah of Hosts shall come down to fight on Mount Zion, and on its hill.

5. As birds that fly, so Jehovah of Hosts will shield over Jerusalem; shielding and delivering, and passing over, He will save it .   

6. Turn back to Him against whom you have made a deep revolt, sons of Israel.

7. For in that day each shall despise his silver idols and his golden idols, which your hands have made for you; a sin.

8. Then Assyria shall fall by a sword, not of man; yea, a sword, not of man, shall devour him. For he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor.

9. And his rock will pass away from fear; and his commanders shall tremble at the banner, declares Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.  

## Isaiah 32

1. Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.

2. And a man shall be a hiding place from the wind, a shelter from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place; like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

3. And the eyes of those that see shall not be dim, and the ears of those who hear shall listen.

4. And the heart of the rash shall discern knowledge; and the tongue of those that stutter shall hurry to speak clear things.

5. The fool shall no more be called noble, and a miser will not be said to be generous.

6. For the fool speaks foolishness, and his heart works iniquity, to do ungodliness; and to speak error against Jehovah, to make the hungry soul empty; and he causes the drink of the thirsty to fail.

7. And the weapons of the miser are evil; he devises wicked plots to destroy the poor with lying words, even the needy when he speaks right.

8. But the noble one devises noble things; and he shall rise by noble things.   

9. O women who are at ease, rise up. Hear my voice; confident daughters, listen to my word.

10. You will shake for days on a year, confident women; for the vintage fails; the harvest will not come.

11. Tremble, women at ease; shake, confident women; strip and make yourselves bare, and bind on sackcloth on your loins;

12. be wailing over breasts, over pleasant fields, over the fruitful vine.

13. Thorns and briers shall spring up on the land of My people; even over all the houses of joy in the jubilant city,

14. because the palace is forsaken; the crowd of the city is forsaken; mound and tower are instead caves, until forever; a joy of wild asses; pasture for flocks;

15. until is poured out on us the Spirit from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field; and the fruitful field is reckoned as a forest.

16. Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall dwell in the fruitful field.

17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the service of righteousness shall be quietness and hope forever.

18. And My people shall live in a peaceful home, and in safe dwellings, and in secure resting places.

19. Though it hails when the forest is felled, and the city is laid low,

20. blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the foot of the ox and the ass.  

## Isaiah 33

1. Woe to the destroyer, and you not being destroyed; and to the betrayer, and they did not betray you! When you finish destroying, you will be destroyed; when you stop betraying, they will betray you.

2. O Jehovah, be gracious to us. We have hoped in You; be their arm in the mornings, our salvation also in time of distress.

3. At the sound of the tumult, the peoples fled; at Your exaltation, nations scattered.

4. And Your prey shall be gathered as the stripping locust gathers; as locusts run to and fro, he also runs about on it.

5. Jehovah is exalted, for He lives on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

6. And He will be the security of your times, strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of Jehovah is His treasure.

7. Behold, their heroes cry outside; the envoys of peace shall weep bitterly.

8. The highways are deserted; the path crosser ceases. He has broken the covenant; he has rejected cities; he has not respected man.

9. The land mourns and droops; Lebanon is ashamed; Sharon withers like a wilderness; Bashan is shaken out; also Carmel.

10. Now I will rise up, says Jehovah. Now I will be exalted; now I will be lifted up.

11. You shall conceive chaff; you shall bear stumble; your fiery breath shall devour you.

12. And peoples shall be as burnings of lime; as thorns cut away, they shall be burned in fire.   

13. Distant ones, hear what I have done; and you near ones, know My might.

14. The sinners of Zion are afraid; terror has seized profane ones; who of us shall tarry with consuming fire? Who of us shall tarry with everlasting burnings?

15. He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands free from taking the bribe, who stops his ear from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil.

16. He shall live on high; strongholds of rocks will be his retreat; his bread shall be given; his waters are faithful.

17. Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall see a land that is very far off.

18. Your heart shall ponder terror: Where is the scribe? Where is he weighing? Where is he counting the towers?

19. You shall not see the fierce people, from hearing a people of a difficult lip, of a foreign tongue, that none understands.

20. Behold, Zion, the city of our appointed meetings! Your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet home. a tent that shall not be moved; its stakes shall not be pulled up forever, nor shall any of its cords be pulled off.

21. But majestic Jehovah will place there for us a place of rivers and streams, broad on both hands; a ship with oars shall not go in it, and a majestic boat shall not pass through it.

22. For Jehovah is our judge; Jehovah is our lawgiver; Jehovah is our king; He will save us.

23. Your ropes are loosened; they do not hold the base of their mast; they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of much plunder shall be divided; the lame shall seize on the spoil.

24. And an inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people who live in it shall not say , iniquity is taken away.  

## Isaiah 34

1. Nations, come near to hear; and peoples, listen! Let the earth hear, and its fullness, the world and all its offspring.

2. For the wrath of Jehovah is on all the nations, and fury on all their army; He has devoted them; He gave them to slaughter.

3. And their slain shall be thrown out; and the stench from their carcasses shall rise; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

4. And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together like a scroll. Then all their host shall droop, as a leaf drooping from the vine, and as the drooping from a fig tree.

5. For My sword is drenched in the heavens. Behold, it shall come down on Edom, and on the people of My curse, for judgment.

6. A sword is to Jehovah; it is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

7. And wild oxen shall come down with them, and bullocks with strong bulls; and their land is drenched with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

8. For the day of vengeance is to Jehovah, the year of repayments for Zion's cause.   

9. And its torrents shall be turned to pitch, and its dust to brimstone; and its land shall become burning pitch.

10. It shall not be put out night or day; its smoke shall rise forever. From generation to generation, it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it forever and forever.

11. But the owl and the hedgehog shall possess it; and the eared owl and the raven shall live in it. And He shall stretch out on it the line of shame, and the stones of emptiness.

12. They shall call its nobles to a kingdom, but none shall be there; and all her rulers shall be nothing.

13. And thorns shall grow in her palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it shall be a home for jackals, a court for daughters of ostriches.

14. The desert creatures shall also meet with the howlers; and the shaggy goat shall cry to his fellow. The screech owl shall also settle there, and find a place of rest for herself.

15. The snake shall nest there, and shall lay, and hatch, and shall gather in her shadow. Vultures shall also be gathered together, each with its mate.

16. Search and read from the Book of Jehovah; not one of these misses, each not lacking her mate; for He has commanded my mouth, and by His Spirit He has assembled them.

17. And He has made fall a lot for them, and His hand divided it to them by line. They shall possess it until forever, from generation to generation they shall live in it.  

## Isaiah 35

1. The wilderness and dry land shall rejoice for them; and the desert shall exult and bloom like the crocus.

2. Blooming, it shall bloom and exult, even with joy and singing. Lebanon's glory shall be given to it, the honor of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the majesty of our God.

3. Make the weak hands strong, and firm up the feeble knees.

4. Say to those of a hasty heart, Be strong! Do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance; with the full dealing of God, He will come and save you.   

5. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf opened.

6. Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. For waters shall break out in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.

7. And the mirage shall become a pool, and the thirsty land shall become springs of waters, in the home of jackals, in its lair, and a place for the reed and rush.

8. And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it. And it is for them, the wayfaring one; yea, fools shall not go astray.

9. No lion shall be there; and no violent beast shall go up on it; it shall not be found there. But redeemed ones shall walk there.

10. And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return and enter Zion, with singing and everlasting joy on their head; gladness and joy shall reach them ; and sorrow and sighing shall flee.  

## Isaiah 36

1. And it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.

2. And the king of Assyria sent the chief of the cupbearers from Lachish to Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the Fuller's Field.

3. And Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah, the recorder, came out to him.

4. And the chief of the cupbearers said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, The great king says this, the king of Assyria, What trust is this in which you trust?

5. I say, Are only words of the lips counsel and strength for war? Now, in whom have you trusted that you rebelled against me?

6. Behold, you trust on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it goes into his palm and pierces it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

7. But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed? And He said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar.

8. Now, then, please exchange pledges with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to set riders on them for you.

9. How then will you turn away the face of one commander of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariotry and horsemen?

10. And now have I come up against this land to destroy it without Jehovah? Jehovah said to me, Go up to this land and destroy it.   

11. And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the chief of the cupbearers, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we hear. But do not speak to us in Judean, in the ears of the people on the wall.

12. But the chief of the cupbearers said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Is it not on the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink the water of their feet with you?

13. And the chief of the cupbearers stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

14. So says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to save you.

15. And let not Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely save us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

16. Do not listen to Hezekiah. For the king of Assyria says this, Make peace with me and come out to me. Then let each eat of his own vine, and each of his own fig tree, and each drink the waters of his own well,

17. until I come and take you to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

18.  Let not Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Have the gods of he nations delivered a man of his land from the king of Assyria's hand?

19. Where are the gods of Hamath, and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

20. Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should keep Jerusalem out of ny hand?

21. But they were silent, and did not answer him a word; for this was the king's order, saying, Do not answer him.

22. And Eliakim, Hilkiah's son who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their garments torn. And they reported to him the words of the chief of cupbearers.  

## Isaiah 37

1. And it happened when king Hezekiah heard, he tore his garments and was covered with sackcloth. And he went into the house of Jehovah.

2. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

3. And they said to him, So says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and reproach, and contempt. For sons have come to the breach and there is no strength to give birth.

4. It may be Jehovah your God will hear the words of the chief of the cupbearers whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and rebuke against the words which Jehovah your God has heard. And you shall lift up prayer for the remnant that is found.

5. So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said to them, You shall say this to your master, So says Jehovah: Do not fear the words which you have heard, with which the followers of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me

7. Behold, I will send a spirit into him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.   

8. So the chief of the cupbearers returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had set out from Lachish.

9. And he heard about Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia, saying, He has come out to fight with you. And he heard and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. So you shall say to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying, Do no let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the king of Assyria's hand.

11. Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, to destroy them utterly. And shall you be saved

12. Have the gods of the nations saved those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden in Telassar?

13. Where is Hamath's king, and Arpad's king, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the couriers, and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it before Jehovah.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,

16. O Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, who dwells between the cherubs, You are He, God, You alone to all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.

17. Bow down Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear. Open Your eye, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent, to reproach the living God.

18. Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have crushed all the lands, and their land,

19. and have given their gods into the fire (for they were not gods, only the work of men's hands, wood and stone; so they have destroyed them).

20. And now, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are Jehovah, You alone.   

21. And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, So says Jehovah, God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib the king of Assyria,

22. this is the word Jehovah has spoken about him: The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you, laughing you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken the head behind you.

23. Whom have you mocked and reviled? And against whom have you lifted your voice, and lifted your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!

24. By your servants, you have mocked the Lord, and said, By my many chariots I have come up to the tops of mountains, the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, its choice fir trees; and I will go to its greatest height, the forest of its fruitful field.

25. I have dug and drunk water; and I have dried up the streams of Egypt with the sole of my feet.

26. Have you not heard it from afar? I have made it from days of old, even I formed it. Now I have caused it to come, and you are to cause fortified cities to crash into heaps, ruins.

27. And their inhabitants were short of hand, dismayed and ashamed. They were as the field grass and the green herbs; like the grass of the housetops, even blasted before it has risen.

28. But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against Me.

29. Because of your raging against Me, and your arrogance has come up to My ears, even I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips; and I will turn you back by the way you came in.

30. And this shall be the sign to you: You shall eat self sown grain this year; and the second year, that which springs up; and in the third year you shall sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

31. The remnant of the house of Judah that has escaped shall again take root downward, and it makes fruit upward.

32. For a remnant shall go out of Jerusalem, and the escaped ones out of Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah of Hosts shall do this.

33. So Jehovah says this to the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with a shield, nor pour out a siege mound on it.

34. He shall return by the same way that he came in, and he shall not come into this city, says Jehovah.

35. For I will defend over this city to save it, for My own sake, and for My servant David's sake.

36. Then the Angel of Jehovah went out and struck a hundred and eighty five thousand in the camp of Assyria. And they rose early in the morning; and, behold! They were all dead corpses.

37. And Sennacherib, king of Assyria, set out, and went and returned; and he lived at Nineveh.

38. And it happened as he was worshiping in the house of his god Nisroch, even his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword. And they escaped into the land of Ararat. And his son Esarhaddon reigned in his place.  

## Isaiah 38

1. In those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, So says Jehovah, Command your house, for you are dying, and shall not live.

2. And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Jehovah,

3. and said, O Jehovah, I beg You to remember now that I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart; and I have done the good in Your eyes. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.

4. Then the word of Jehovah was to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go and say to Hezekiah, So says Jehovah the God of your father David, I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your days.

6. And I will deliver you and this city out of the king of Assyria's hand. And I will shield over this city.

7. So this shall be the sign to you from Jehovah, that Jehovah shall do this thing that He has spoken:

8. Behold, I will bring back the shadow of the steps which has gone down in the steps of Ahaz with the sun, backward ten steps. So the sun went back up ten steps, by which steps it had gone down!   

9. The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his illness:

10. I said in the pause of my days, I shall go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years.

11. I said, I shall not see Jah Jehovah in the land of the living; I shall no longer look on man with the world's inhabitants.

12. My generation is plucked up and carried away from me, like a shepherd's tent; I have cut off my life like the weaver. He will cut me off from the loom; from day to night You will make an end of me.

13. I leveled my soul until morning. Like a lion, so He shatters all my bones. From day until night You make an end of me.

14. Like a swift or a crane, so I chatter. I moan as the dove; my eyes look weakly to the heights, O Jehovah; it presses me down; be surety for me!

15. What shall I say? For He speaks to me, and He has acted. I shall go softly all my years over the bitterness of my soul.

16. O Lord, on them they live, and for all in them is the life of my spirit. And You heal me, and make me live.

17. Behold, for peace was bitter to me, most bitter; but You loved my soul from the pit of destruction; You have cast all my sins behind Your back.

18. For Sheol cannot thank You; death cannot praise You; the ones going down to the Pit cannot hope for Your truth.

19. The living, the living is the one thanking You; as I do today. The father makes known Your truth to his sons.

20. For Jehovah is for my salvation; and we will play my songs on stringed instruments all the days of our life, at the house of Jehovah.

21. For Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs and rub it on the ulcer, and he will live.

22. And Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Jehovah?  

## Isaiah 39

1. At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah For he had heard that he was ill, and was made strong.

2. And Hezekiah was glad because of them and let them see the house of his treasure, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good oil, and all his weapons, and all that was found in his treasuries; there was nothing in his house or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not let them see.

3. And Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say? And from where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a distant land to me, from Babylon.

4. Then he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said, They have seen all that is in my house; there is not a thing among my treasures that I have not made them see.   

5. And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of Hosts:

6. Behold, days come when all that is in your house, even what your fathers have treasured up until now, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.

7. And they shall take of your sons who shall issue from you, which you shall father; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

8. Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Jehovah that you have said is good. And he said, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.  

## Isaiah 40

1. Comfort, O comfort My people, says your God.

2. Speak lovingly to the heart of Jerusalem; yea, cry to her that her warfare is done, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has taken from the hand of Jehovah double for all her sins.   

3. The voice of him who cries in the wilderness: Prepare the way of Jehovah; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

4. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the knoll shall be a level place, and the rough places a plain.

5. And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.

6. A voice said, Cry! And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all its grace as the flower of the field!

7. The grass withers, the flower fades because the Spirit of Jehovah blows on it. Surely the people is grass.

8. The grass withers; the flower fades; but the word of our God shall rise forever.   

9. You who bring good news to Zion, go up for yourself on the high mountain, bringer of good news to Zion. Lift up your voice with strength, bringer of good news to Jerusalem. Lift up; do not fear. Say to the cities of Judah, Behold! Your God!

10. Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with strength, and His arm rules for Him. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His wage before Him.

11. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather lambs with His arm; and carry them in His bosom; those with young He will lead;   

12.  He who has measured in His palm the waters and the heavens by a span meted out; and enclosed in the measure the dust of the earth, and weighed in the balance the mountains, and the hills in the scales,

13. Who has meted out the Spirit of Jehovah, or a man His counsel taught Him?

14. With whom did He take counsel, and who trained Him and taught Him in the path of justice; and taught Him knowledge, and made known to Him the way of discernment?

15. Lo, nations are as a drop from a bucket, and are reckoned as dust of the scales. Lo, He takes up coasts as a little thing.

16. And Lebanon is not enough to burn, nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering.

17. All the nations are as nothing before Him; to Him they are reckoned less than nothing and emptiness.   

18. And to whom will you liken God? Or what likeness will you array to Him?

19. The craftsman pours out the casted image, the smelter spreads it with gold; and he casts the chains of silver.

20. He too poor for that offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks a skilled artisan for him, to prepare a carved image that will not be shaken.

21. Have you not known? Have you not heard? Was it not told to you from the beginning? Did you not discern from the foundations of the earth?

22. He who sits on the circle of the earth, even its dwellers are like grasshoppers; He who stretches the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in;

23. who gives potentates into nothing. He makes judges of the earth as nothing.

24. Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they are not sown; yea, their stem is not taking root in the earth. And He shall also blow on them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away like stubble.

25. To whom then will you compare Me, or am I equaled, says the Holy One?

26. Lift up your eyes on high and look: Who has created these? Who brings out their host by number? By greatness of vigor, and might of power, He calls them all by names; not one is lacking.   

27. Why will you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel; My way is hidden from Jehovah, and my judgment is passed over by my God?

28. Have you not known? Have you not heard? Jehovah, the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth; He is not faint, nor does He grow weary; there is no searching to His understanding.

29.  He gives power to the faint, and to him with no vigor He increases might.

30. Even youths are faint and fatigued, and young men surely shall stumble;

31. but the ones waiting for Jehovah shall renew power; they shall go up with wings as the eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not be faint!  

## Isaiah 41

1. Be quiet before Me, O coasts; and let peoples renew their power. They come near; then they speak: Let us draw near together for judgment.

2. Who raised up the righteous one from the east? He called him to His foot; He gives nations before him, and subdues kings; He gives them as dust to his sword, as driven stubble to his bow;

3. He pursues them; he passes on in peace; he does not go by the way with his feet.

4. Who has planned and done it , calling forth the generations from the beginning? I Jehovah am the first and the last; I am He.

5. The coasts have seen and fear; the ends of the earth tremble; they have drawn near; yea, they come.

6. Each man helps his neighbor, and says to his brother, Be strong.

7. So the carver strengthens the refiner; and he smoothing with the hammer, him who struck the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good. And he made it strong with nails; it will not totter.

8. But you Israel are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen; the seed of My friend Abraham;

9. whom I have made strong from the ends of the earth, and called you from its sides; and I said to you, You are My servant. I chose you, and have not rejected you .   

10. Do not fear, for I am with you; do not gaze about, for I am your God; I will make you strong; yea, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.

11. Behold, all who were provoked with you shall be ashamed and confounded; they shall be as nothing; and they who fight with you Shall perish.

12. You shall seek them and shall not find them; men of your strife shall be as nothing, even men of your battle as ceasing.

13. For I, Jehovah your God am strengthening your right hand; who says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.

14. Fear not, worm of Jacob, men of Israel; I will help you; states Jehovah, and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

15. Behold! I have made you a new sharp threshing instrument, a master of teeth; you shall thresh mountains and beat them small, and shall make hills like the chaff.

16. You shall winnow them, and the wind will carry them away; and the tempest will scatter them. And you shall rejoice in Jehovah; you shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.

17. The poor and the needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue is parched for thirst. I, Jehovah will hear them; the God of Israel will not leave them.

18. I will open rivers in bare places, and fountains in the midst of valleys; I will make the desert for a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

19. I will plant cedar in the wilderness, acacia, and myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set fir, pine and boxwood together in the desert;

20. So that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah has done this; and the Holy One of Israel has created it.   

21. Bring your cause, says Jehovah; let your strong reasons come near, says the King of Jacob.

22. Let them draw near and tell us what shall happen; the former things, let them reveal what they are , that we may set our heart and know their end; or declare to us the coming things.

23. Reveal the near things hereafter, so that we may know that you are gods. Yea, do good, or do evil, that we may gaze and see together.

24. Behold, you are of nothing; and your work of nothing; he who chooses you is an abomination.

25. I have raised up one from the north; and he shall come from the east; he will call on My name. And he shall come upon rulers as on mortar, and as a potter tramples clay.

26. Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know; and beforetime, that we may say, He is right? Yea, no one declares; yea, no one proclaims; yea, there is no one who hears your words.

27. At first to Zion, I say , Behold! Behold them! And I will give to Jerusalem one bearing tidings.

28. But I saw, and there was not a man; and of these, there was not a counselor, that I may ask them, and they could answer a word.

29. Behold, they are all evil; their works are nothing; their images are wind and vanity.  

## Isaiah 42

1. Behold My Servant; I will uphold Him; My Elect in whom My soul delights! I have put My Spirit on Him; He shall bring forth justice to the nations.

2. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.

3. A bruised reed He shall not break, and a smoking wick He shall not quench; He shall bring forth justice to truth.

4. He shall not fail nor be crushed until He has set justice in the earth; and the coasts shall wait for His law.   

5. So says Jehovah God, creating the heavens and stretching them out; spreading out the earth and its offspring, giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it.

6. I, Jehovah, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You for a covenant of the people, for a Light of the nations;

7. to open blind eyes, to deliver the prisoner from the prison; those who sit in darkness from the prison.

8. I am Jehovah; that is My name; and I will not give My glory to another, nor My praise to engraved images.

9. Behold, the former things have come to pass, and I declare new things before they happen, I cause you to hear.

10. Sing a new song to Jehovah; His praise from the end of the earth, you who go to sea, and all that is in it; the coasts and their people.

11. Let the wilderness and its cities lift up, the villages where Kedar lives. Let the dwellers of the rock sing; let them shout from the top of the mountains.

12. They give glory to Jehovah and declare His praise in the coastlands.   

13. Jehovah shall go out as a warrior; and He shall stir up His zeal like a man of war; He shall shout, yea, roar; He shall act mightily on His enemies.

14. I have forever kept silence; I have been quiet and refrained Myself; I will groan like a woman in travail; I will pant and gasp at once.

15. I will make mountains and hills become a waste, and dry up all their plants. And I will make the rivers coastlands, and I will dry up pools.

16. And I will lead the blind by a way they knew not; I will lead them in paths they never knew; I will make darkness into light before them, and crooked places a level place. I do these things to them and do not forsake them;

17. they are turned back; they are ashamed with shame, those trusting in the carved image, who say to cast images, You are our gods.   

18. O deaf ones, hear! And O blind ones, look to see!

19. Who is blind but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger whom I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace, and blind as Jehovah's servant?

20. You see many things, but do not observe; your ears are open, but not any hears.

21. Jehovah is delighted for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the Law and make it honorable.

22. But it is a people robbed and spoiled; they shall all be snared in holes; they were hidden in prison houses. They were for spoil, and no one delivers; a prey, and no one says, Return!

23. Who among you will hear this, will listen and hear for the time to come?

24. Who gave Jacob to the plunderer, and Israel to the robbers? Did not Jehovah, He against whom we have sinned? For they willed not to walk in His ways, and they did not obey His law.

25. And He poured on him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle; and it has set him on fire all around, yet he did not know; and it burned him, yet he did not lay it on his heart.  

## Isaiah 43

1. But now so says Jehovah who formed you, O Jacob; and He who made you, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I called you by your name; you are Mine.

2. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk in the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame kindle on you.

3. For I am Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I gave Egypt for your atonement; Ethiopia and Seba instead of you.

4. Since you were precious in My eyes, you are honored, and I love you; and I give men instead of you; and peoples instead of your soul.

5. Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your seed from the sunrise; and I will gather you from the sunset.

6. I will say to the north, Give up! And to the south, Do not hold back! Bring My sons from afar, and bring My daughters from the ends of the earth;

7. everyone who is called by My name, and I have created him for My glory; I have formed him; yea, I have made him.   

8. Bring out the blind people, yet there are eyes; and the deaf, yet there are ears to him.

9. Let all the nations be assembled, and let the peoples be gathered. Who among them can declare this and cause us to hear former things? Let them give their witnesses, that they may be justified. Or let them hear and say, It is true.

10. You are My witnesses, says Jehovah; and My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me there was no God formed; nor shall any be after Me.

11. I, I am Jehovah; and there is no Savior besides Me.

12. I declared, and I saved, and I proclaimed; and there is not an alien god among you. And you are My witnesses, says Jehovah, and I am God.

13. Yea, from this day I am He, and no one delivers from My hand. I will work, and who will reverse it?   

14. So says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down as fugitives all of them, even the Chaldeans, whose shout is in the ships.

15. I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.

16. So says Jehovah, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in mighty waters;

17. who brings out chariot and horse, force and power; they shall lie down together; they shall not rise; they are put out; they are snuffed out like the wick.

18. Do not remember former things, nor consider the things of old.

19. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall sprout. Shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.

20. The beast of the field shall honor Me, jackals and daughters of ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen.

21. The people that I formed for Myself shall declare My praise.   

22. But you have not called on Me, Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, Israel.

23. You have not brought Me the lamb of your burnt offerings; even your sacrifices have not honored Me. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.

24. You have not bought calamus for Me with silver, nor have you filled Me with fat of your sacrifices; but you made Me serve by your sins; you wearied Me by your iniquities.

25. I, even I, am He who blots out your trespasses for My sake; and I will not remember your sins.

26. Cause Me to remember; let us enter into judgment together; sum up for yourself, that you may be justified.

27. Your first father sinned, and your interpreters transgressed against Me.

28. And I will defile the rulers of the sanctuary, and will give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reviling.  

## Isaiah 44

1. And now listen, My servant Jacob, and Israel whom I have chosen.

2. So says Jehovah, who made you and formed you from the womb. He helps you. Do not fear, My servant Jacob; and you, Jeshurun whom I have chosen.

3. For I will pour water on a thirsty place, and floods on the dry ground. I will pour My Spirit on your seed, and My blessing on your offspring.

4. And they shall sprout as among grass, as willows by streams of water.

5. One shall say, I am Jehovah's; and another will call by the name of Jacob; and this one shall write with his hand, For Jehovah; and be named by the name of Israel.

6. So says Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts: I am the First and I am the last; and there is no God except Me.

7. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare this, and set it in order before Me, since I placed the people of old? And as to things to come, even which shall come, let them declare concerning them.

8. Do not dread, nor be afraid. Have I not declared and made you hear since then? So you are My witnesses: Is there a God besides Me? Yea, there is none. I have not known a Rock.   

9. Those who form a carved image are all of them vanity. And their delights do not profit; and they are their own witnesses. They do not see, nor know, that they may be ashamed.

10. Who has formed a god, or poured out an image, to no profit?

11. Behold, all his companions shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen, they are from men. They shall assemble, all of them shall stand; they shall dread; they shall be shamed together.

12. He carves iron with a tool; he works in the coals and forms it with hammers, and works it with his powerful arm; then he is hungry, and has no strength; he drinks no water and is weary.

13. He fashions wood, and stretches a line; he marks it with a stylus; he shapes it with a carving tool, and he marks it with a compass. And he makes it according to the figure of a man, as the beauty of a man, to sit in the house.

14. He cuts down cedars and takes cypress and oak, and he makes the trees of the forest strong for him. He plants a tree, and rain makes it grow.

15. And it shall be for a man to burn; yea, he takes of them and is warmed; and he kindles it and bakes bread. Yea, he makes a god and worships; he makes a carved image and bows to it.

16. He burns half of it in the fire; he eats flesh on half of it; he roasts roast, and is satisfied. Then he warms himself and says, Ah, I am warm; I have seen the fire.

17. And he makes a god of the rest, his carved image; he bows to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me, for you are my god.

18. They do not know, nor discern; for He has smeared their eyes from seeing, their hearts from understanding.

19. And not one turns back to his heart, nor has knowledge nor discernment to say, I have burned half of it in the fire; and I also have baked bread on its coals. I have roasted flesh and have eaten it; and I have made the rest of it into an idol. Shall I bow to a product of a tree?

20. Feeding on ashes, a deceived heart turns him aside, and he does not deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?   

21. Remember these, O Jacob, and Israel. For you are My servant; I have formed you; you are My servant, O Israel; you shall not forget Me.

22. I have blotted out your transgressions like a thick cloud; and your sins like a cloud. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.

23. Sing, O heavens, for Jehovah has done it . Shout, O lower parts of the earth; burst forth into praise, O mountains. O forest and every tree in it, sing praise , because Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and glorifies Himself in Israel.

24. So says Jehovah, your Redeemer and your Former from the womb; I am Jehovah who makes all things; stretching out the heavens; I alone, spreading out the earth. Who was with Me,

25. frustrating the signs of liars; yea, He makes diviners mad; turning wise ones backward, and making their knowledge foolish.

26. He confirms the word of His servant, and completes the counsel of His messengers. He says to Jerusalem, You will be filled; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built; and, I will raise up its ruins.

27.  He says to the deep, Be a waste! And I will dry up your rivers!

28.  He says to Cyrus, You are My shepherd; and he shall fulfill all My will, even to say to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, You shall be set up.  

## Isaiah 45

1. So says Jehovah to His anointed, to Cyrus, whom I have seized by his right hand, to subdue nations before him. Yea, I will open the loins of kings, to open the two leaved doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut.

2. I will go before you and make hills level; I will tear apart the bronze doors, and cut the iron bars in two.

3. And I will give you the treasures of darkness, even treasures in secret places, that you may know that I am Jehovah, who calls you by your name, the God of Israel.

4. For My servant Jacob's sake, and for Israel My chosen, I even call you by your name. I name you, but you do not know Me.   

5. I am Jehovah, and there is none else; there is no God except Me. I will clothe you, though you do not know Me,

6. that they may know from the rising of the sun, and to the sunset, that there is none besides Me; I am Jehovah, and there is none else;

7. forming light, and creating darkness; making peace, and creating evil.

8. Drop down from above, O heavens; and let the clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open and let salvation bear fruit; and let righteousness sprout together. I, Jehovah have created it.

9. Woe to him who fights with the One who formed him! A potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to its former, What are you making? Or does your work say, He has no hands?

10. Woe to him who says to a father, What are you fathering? Or to the woman, What are you laboring over?   

11. So says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and the One who formed him, Do you ask Me of the things to come? Do you give command to Me about My sons, and about the work of My hands?

12. I have made the earth, and created man on it. I stretched out the heavens with My hands; and I have set all their host in order.

13. I raised him up in righteousness, and have made straight all his ways. He shall build My city, and he will release My captives; not for price, nor for reward, says Jehovah of Hosts.

14. So says Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and the goods of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come to you; and they shall be yours. They shall come after you; they shall cross in chains; and they shall bow to you; they shall plead to you. Surely God is in you, and there is none else, no other God.

15. Truly, You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

16. They shall be ashamed, and also are disgraced, all of them. Together they go into disgrace, carvers of images.

17. Israel is saved in Jehovah with everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed nor disgraced to the forevers of eternity.

18. For so says Jehovah, Creator of the heavens; He is God, forming the earth and making it; He makes it stand, not creating it empty, but forming it to be inhabited. I am Jehovah, and there is none else.

19. I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I did not say to Jacob's seed, Seek Me in vain. I Jehovah speak righteousness, declaring right things.   

20. Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, escaped ones of the nations; the ones who set up the wood of their carved image, and the ones who pray to a god who cannot save; they know nothing.

21. Declare and bring near; yea, let them consult together. Who has revealed this of old; who has told it from then? Is it not I, Jehovah? And there is no God other than Me; a just God and a Savior; there is none except Me.

22. Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.

23. I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

24. He shall say, Only in Jehovah do I have righteousness and strength; to Him he comes; and they are ashamed, all who are angry with Him.

25. In Jehovah all of the seed of Israel shall be justified, and shall glory.  

## Isaiah 46

1. Bel has bowed; Nebo stoops; their idols are for the beast, and for the cattle; your things carried are loads; a burden for the weary.

2. They stoop; they bow together; they are not able to deliver the burden; and their soul has gone into captivity.

3. Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel; who are borne from the belly, who are lifted from the womb:

4. Even to old age I am He; and I will bear to gray hair; I made, and I will carry; and I will bear and deliver.   

5. To whom will you compare and make Me equal; yea, compare Me, that we may be alike?

6. Those who lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver on the measuring rod; they hire a refiner and he makes it a god. They fall down; yea, they worship.

7. They carry it on the shoulder; they bear it and set it in its place, and it stands; it shall not move from its place. Yes, he cries to it, but it does not answer, it does not save him from his distress.

8. Remember this and be a man; return it on your heart, transgressors.

9. Remember former things from forever, for I am God, and no one else is God, even none like Me,

10. declaring the end from the beginning, and from the past those things which were not done, saying, My purpose shall rise; and, I will do all My desire;

11. calling a bird of prey from the sunrise, the man of My counsel from a far off land. Yes, I have spoken; yes, I will cause it to come; I have formed; yes, I will do it.

12. Listen to Me, mighty ones of heart who are far from righteousness:

13. I bring near My righteousness; it shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not wait; I will place salvation in Zion, My glory for Israel.  

## Isaiah 47

1. Go down and sit on the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the earth; a throne is not to the daughter of the Chaldeans; for they shall not again call you tender and delicate.

2. Take millstones and grind meal; uncover your veil; strip off the skirt; uncover the leg; pass over rivers.

3. Your nakedness shall be uncovered; yea, your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance and I will not meet a man.

4. Our Redeemer; Jehovah of Hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel.

5. Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, for they shall no more call you the mistress of kingdoms.

6. I was angry with My people; I defiled My inheritance and gave them into your hand. You gave them no mercy; you made your yoke on the aged very heavy.   

7. And you said, I shall be a mistress forever, until you did not set these things on your heart, and not did remember its end.

8. Now, then, hear this, O pleasure seeker, who lives carelessly; who says in her heart, I am , and none else is ; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children.

9. But these two things shall suddenly come to you, in one day: loss of children, and widowhood; as complete they come on you, for your many sorceries, for the multitude of your great spells.

10. For you trusted in your evil; you said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge perverts you, and you said in your heart, I am and none else is .

11. For this, evil shall come on you; you shall not know its origin. And mischief shall fall on you; you shall not be able to cover it. And ruin shall come on you suddenly, you shall not know.

12. Stand now among your spells, and with your many sorceries, in which you have wearied yourself since your youth. Perhaps you will be able to profit; perhaps may cause quaking.

13. You are exhausted by your many plans; let those dividing the heavens stand up now and save you, the stargazers, making known what is coming on you into the new moons.

14. Behold, they are as stubble; the fire burns them; they shall not save their soul from the flame's hand; there is no coal to warm them; nor fire, to sit before it.

15. So they are to you with whom you have labored, your traders from your youth; each one wanders to his own way; no one saves you.  

## Isaiah 48

1. Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come out from the waters of Judah, who swear by Jehovah's name and profess by the God of Israel, not in truth or in righteousness.

2. For they are called of the holy city, and rest themselves on the God of Israel; Jehovah of Hosts is His name.

3. I have foretold the former things from then; and they went out of My mouth; and I made them hear; suddenly I acted, and they came about.

4. Because I knew that you are hard, and your neck is a sinew of iron, and your brow brass.

5. And I declared to you from then; before it came I made you hear, lest you should say, My idol did them; and my image and my casted image commanded them.

6. You heard; see it all; and will you not declare? I made you hear new things from now, even hidden things, and you did not know them.

7. They are created now, and not from then; even before today, but you did not hear them; lest you should say, See, I knew them.

8. Yea, you did not hear; yea, you did not know; yea, from then your ear was not opened; for I know you surely will betray and trespass, from the womb it was called to you.   

9. For My name's sake I will put off My anger; and for My praise I will hold back for you, so as not to cut you off.

10. Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.

11. For My sake, for My sake, I will act; for how is it defiled? And I will not give My glory to another.

12. Listen to Me, O Jacob, and Israel My called: I am He; I am the first; I surely am the last.

13. My hand surely founded earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens; I called to them, they stood up together.

14. All of you gather and hear: Who among them has declared these things ? Jehovah has loved him. He will do His pleasure on Babylon; yea, His arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

15. I, I have spoken; yea, I have called him, I brought him, and he causes his way to prosper.   

16. Come near to me; hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. From its being, I was there; and now the Lord Jehovah, and His Spirit, has sent Me.

17. So says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am Jehovah your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you in the way you should go.

18. Oh that you had listened to My commands! Then your peace would have been like the river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

19. And your seed would have been like the sand, and your offspring of your bowels like its grain; his name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from My presence.

20. Go out of Babylon; flee from the Chaldeans. Tell this with the voice of rejoicing; let this be heard, let it go out to the end of the earth; say, Jehovah has redeemed His servant Jacob.

21. And they did not thirst; He led them in the deserts; He made waters flow out of rock for them. And He cut open the rock and the water gushed out.

22.  There is no peace, says Jehovah, to the wicked.  

## Isaiah 49

1. Hear Me, coastlands, and you people from afar, and prick up your ear , Jehovah called Me from the womb; He mentioned My name from My mother's belly.

2. And He made My mouth like a sharp sword; He hid Me in the shadow of His hand, and made Me a polished arrow; He hid me in His quiver;

3. and said to Me, You are My servant, Israel, You in whom I shall be glorified.

4. Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have spent My strength for nothing, and in vain; yet surely My judgment is with Jehovah, and My work with My God.

5. And now, says Jehovah who formed Me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him: Though Israel is not gathered, yet I am honored in the eye of Jehovah, and My God is My strength.

6. And He said, It is too little that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You for a light of the nations, that You may be My salvation to the end of the earth.   

7. So says Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to the despised of soul, to the hated of the nation, the servant of rulers, Kings shall see and rise up; and chiefs shall worship; because of Jehovah who is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel; and He chose You.

8. So says Jehovah: In a favorable time I have answered You, and in a day of salvation I have helped You. And I will preserve You, and give You for a covenant of the people; to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolated inheritances;

9. to say to the prisoners, Go out! To those who are in darkness, Show yourselves! They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.

10. They shall not hunger nor thirst; and the heat and sun shall not strike them. For He who has mercy on them shall lead them; and He shall guide them by the springs of water.

11. And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be set on high.

12. Behold, these shall come from afar; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.   

13. Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; break out into singing, O mountains. For Jehovah has comforted His people and will have pity on His afflicted.

14. But Zion said, Jehovah has forsaken me, and, My Lord has forgotten me.

15. Can a woman forget her suckling child, from pitying the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will surely not forget you.

16. Behold, I have carved you on the palms of My hands; your walls are always before Me.

17. Your sons hurry; those destroying you and ruining you shall go out from you.   

18. Lift up your eyes all around and see! They all gather and come to you. As I live, says Jehovah, you shall surely wear all of them as an ornament, and bind them on as a bride.

19. For your wastes and your deserted places, and your land of ruins shall even now be too narrow to live there ; and they who swallow you shall be far away.

20. The sons of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too narrow for me; come near so that I may live.

21. Then you shall say in your heart, Who has borne these to me, for I am bereaved and desolate, turned aside and an exile; who then has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone. From where do these come ?

22. So says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and will set up My banner to peoples. And they shall bring your sons in the bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on the shoulder.

23. And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nurses. They shall bow to you, faces down to the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, by whom they who wait for Me shall not be ashamed.   

24. Shall the plunder be taken from the warrior, or the righteous captive escape?

25. But so says Jehovah, Even the captives of the warrior shall be taken, and the plunder of the terrifying ones shall be delivered. For I will strive with him who contends with you; and I will save your sons.

26. And those who oppress you, I will feed with their own flesh: and they shall be drunk by their own blood, as with fresh wine. And all flesh shall know that I Jehovah am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  

## Isaiah 50

1. So says Jehovah, Where is the scroll of your mother's divorce whom I have put away? Or who of My creditors that I have sold you to him? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, and your mother was put away for your trespasses.

2. Who knows why I have come, and no one is here ? I called, and not one answered. Is My hand truly cut short from ransom? Or is there not power in Me to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea; I make rivers a wilderness; their fish stink because of no water, and die in thirst.

3. I clothe the heavens with blackness, and sackcloth makes their covering.   

4. The Lord Jehovah has given to Me the tongue of taught ones, to know to help the weary with a word. He arouses in the morning; He wakens the ear to Me, to hear as the learned.

5. The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear and I did not rebel; I did not turn away backwards.

6. I gave My back to strikers, and My cheeks to pluckers; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.

7. And the Lord Jehovah will help Me. On account of this I was not ashamed. On account of this I set My face like flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

8. My Justifier is near. Who will contend with Me? Let us stand up together; who is master of My judgment? Let him come near to Me.

9. Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who is He who will condemn Me? Behold, like a garment they shall wear out; the moth shall eat them.   

10. Who among you fears Jehovah, obeying the voice of His servant, who walks in darkness, and no light is in him? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and lean on his God.

11. Behold, all of you who kindle fire, who are surrounded by sparks; walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks you are burning. This shall be to you from My hand; you shall lie down in pain.  

## Isaiah 51

1. Hear Me, pursuers of righteousness, seekers of Jehovah: Look to the rock from which you were cut, and to the hollow of the pit from which you were dug.

2. Look to your father Abraham, and to Sarah who bore you. For he being but one, I called him and blessed him and increased him.

3. For Jehovah comforts Zion. He comforts all her desolations, and He makes her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found in it, thanksgiving and the voice of singing praise.   

4. Hear Me, My people; yea, give ear to Me, My nation. For a law shall go out from Me, and My justice I will make rest as light to peoples.

5. My righteousness is near; My salvation went out; and My arms shall judge peoples; coastlands shall wait on Me, and they shall hope on My arm.

6. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look to the earth beneath; for the heavens vanish like smoke, and the earth shall wear out like a garment; and its inhabitants shall die in the same way, but My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be broken.

7. Hear Me, knowers of righteousness, the people of My law in their heart; do not fear the reproach of man, and do not be bowed from their blasphemings.

8. For the moth shall eat them like a garment; yea, the moth worm shall eat them like wool. But My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation to generation to generation.   

9. Awake! Awake! Arm of Jehovah, put on strength. Awake, as in days of old, everlasting generations. Was it not You cutting in pieces Rahab, and piercing the sea monster?

10. Was it not You drying up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass?

11. Yea, the ransomed of Jehovah shall return and come to Zion with singing, and everlasting joy shall be on their head; gladness and joy shall overtake them ; sorrow and sighing shall flee.

12. I, I am He comforting you. Who are you, that you should fear from man? He shall die! And from the son of man? He is given as grass.

13. And you forget your Maker Jehovah, who has stretched out the heavens and founded the earth. And you dread continually, every day, from the fury of the oppressor, since he was ready to destroy. And where is the fury of the oppressor?

14. Bowed down, he hurries to be freed, and not that he die in the pit, and not that he lack his bread.

15. But I am Jehovah your God, stirring up the sea and a making its waves roar; Jehovah of Hosts is His name.

16. And I have put My words in your mouth, and covered you in the shade of My hand, to plant the heavens and found the earth, and to say to Zion, You are My people.   

17. Awake! Awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem, who drank the cup of His fury from the hand of Jehovah; you drank the bowl of the cup of reeling; you fully drained it .

18. No guide is for her among all the sons she has borne; and none takes her by the hand of all the sons she made to grow.

19. Those two things came to you; who shall wail for you? Ruin and shattering and famine and the sword, who but I shall comfort you?

20. Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of all the streets, like an antelope in a net, filled with the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of your God.

21. So hear this now, afflicted one, and drunken, but not from wine:

22. So says your Lord Jehovah and your God, He strives for His people. Behold, I have taken the cup of reeling out of your hand, the bowl of the cup of My fury; you shall not yet again drink it.

23. But I will put it into the hand of those oppressing you, who have said to your soul, Bow down that we may cross, and Put your back as the ground, and as the street to those who cross.  

## Isaiah 52

1. Awake! Awake! Put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For never again shall uncircumcised and unclean ones come to you.

2. Shake yourself from the dust; rise up! Sit, Jerusalem; free yourself from your neck bands, O captive daughter of Zion.

3. For so says Jehovah: You were sold for nothing, and you will not be redeemed with silver.

4. For so says the Lord Jehovah: My people went down to Egypt at the first, to reside there, and without cause Assyria oppressed him.

5. So then what is to Me here, declares Jehovah? For My people is taken for nothing; his rulers howl, declares Jehovah. And My name is continually despised, every day.

6. So My people shall know My name thus in that day; for I am He speaking. Behold Me!   

7. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him bringing good news, making peace heard, bringing good news, proclaiming salvation; saying to Zion, Your God reigns!

8. The voice of your watchmen, they lift the voice together, they sing aloud. For they shall see eye to eye when Jehovah brings back Zion.

9. Break out, sing together, waste places of Jerusalem; for Jehovah comforts His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.

10. Jehovah has bared His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

11. Turn! Turn! Go out from there! Touch not the unclean! Go out of her midst, purify yourselves, bearers of the vessels of Jehovah.

12. For you shall not go out with haste, nor will you go by flight; for Jehovah is going before you, and the God of Israel gathers you.   

13. Behold, My Servant shall rule wisely; He shall be exalted and lifted up and be very high.

14. Just as many were astonished over You, so much was the disfigurement from man, His appearance and His form from sons of mankind.

15. so He sprinkles from many nations. At Him kings shall shut their mouths; for they will see that which was not told to them; yea, what they had not heard, they will understand.  

## Isaiah 53

1. Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of Jehovah revealed?

2. For He comes up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no form nor magnificence that we should see Him; nor form that we should desire Him.

3.  He is despised and abandoned of men, a Man of pains, and acquainted with sickness. And as it were hiding our faces from Him, He being despised, and we did not value Him.   

4. Surely He has borne our sicknesses, and He carried our pain; yet we esteemed Him plagued, smitten by God, and afflicted.

5. But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His wounds we ourselves are healed.

6. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have each one turned to his own way; and Jehovah made meet in Him the iniquity of all of us.

7. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a ewe before her shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.

8. He was taken from prison and from justice; and who shall consider His generation? For He was cut off out of the land of the living; from the transgression of My people, the stroke was to Him.

9. And He put His grave with the wicked; and with a rich man in His death; although He had done no violence, and deceit was not in His mouth.   

10. But Jehovah pleased to crush Him, to make Him sick, so that If He should put His soul as a guilt offering, He shall see His seed; He shall prolong His days; and the will of Jehovah shall prosper in His hand.

11. He shall see the fruit of the travail of His soul; He shall be fully satisfied. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify for many, and He shall bear their iniquities.

12. Because of this I will divide to Him with the great, and with the strong He shall divide the spoil; because He poured out His soul to death; and He was counted with transgressors; and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for transgressors.  

## Isaiah 54

1. Rejoice, unfruitful one who never bore; break out a song and shout, you who never travailed. For the sons of the desolate one are more than the sons of the married woman, says Jehovah.

2. Make the place of your tent larger, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not spare, lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.

3. For you shall break forth on the right hand and on the left. And your seed shall possess nations, and people will inhabit ruined cities.

4. Do not fear, for you shall not be shamed, nor shall you be abashed, for you shall not be wounded. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and you shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.

5. For your Maker is your husband; Jehovah of Hosts is His name; and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; He is called the God of all the earth.   

6. For Jehovah has called you as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of young men when she is rejected, says your God.

7. For a little moment I have left you, but I will gather you with great pityings.

8. In a flood of wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but I will have pity on you with everlasting kindness, says Jehovah your Redeemer.

9. For this is the waters of Noah to Me; for as I swore to refrain from passing over the waters of Noah over the earth again, so I have sworn from being and with you and rebuking you.

10. For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but My mercy shall not depart from you; nor shall the covenant of My peace be removed, says Jehovah who has pity on you.   

11. Afflicted one, storm tossed and not comforted! Behold, I stretch out your stones among antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.

12. And I will make your battlements of ruby, and your gates carbuncle stones, and all your borders pleasing stones;

13. and all your sons will be taught of Jehovah; and the peace of your sons will be great.

14. You shall be established in righteousness; you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.

15. Behold, they shall surely gather, but not from Me. Who has gathered against you? By you he shall fall.

16. Behold, I have created the smith who blows the coal in the fire, and who brings out a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

17. Every weapon formed against you shall not prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from Me, says Jehovah.  

## Isaiah 55

1. Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the water; and he who has no silver, come buy grain and eat. Yes, come buy grain, wine and milk without silver and with no price.

2. Why do you weigh out silver for that which is not bread, and your labor for what never satisfies? Listen carefully to Me and eat the good; and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

3. Bend your ear and come to Me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will cut a covenant everlasting with you, the faithful mercies of David.

4. Behold, I gave Him a Witness to peoples, a Leader and Commander of peoples.

5. Behold, You shall call a nation You do not know; yea, a nation not knowing You shall run to You, because of Jehovah Your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You.   

6. Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.

7. Let the wicked forsake his way and the vain man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.

8. For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, says Jehovah.

9. For as the heavens are high from the earth, so My ways are high from your ways, and My thoughts from your thoughts.

10. For as the rain and the snow comes down from the heavens and do not return there, except it waters the earth and make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,

11. so shall My word be, which goes out of My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in what I sent it to do!

12. For you shall go out with joy and be led out with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break out into song before you, and all the trees of the field shall clap the palm.

13. Instead of the thornbush, the fir tree shall come up; instead of the brier, the myrtle shall come up; and it shall be for a name to Jehovah, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.  

## Isaiah 56

1. So says Jehovah: Keep justice and do righteousness, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.

2. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it; keeping sabbath, from defiling it; and keeping his hand from doing every evil.   

3. And do not let the son of the foreigner speak, he who joins himself to Jehovah, saying, Jehovah surely separates me from His people; and not do let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dried tree.

4. For so says Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths and choose things I am pleased with, and take hold of My covenant:

5. I, even I will give to them in My house and in My walls a hand and a name better than sons and than daughters; I will give them an everlasting name which shall not be cut off.

6. And the sons of the alien who join themselves on Jehovah to serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be His servants, everyone who keeps from defiling the sabbath, and takes hold of My covenant:

7. even them I will bring to My holy mount and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar, for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples,

8. states the Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, I will yet gather beside him his gathered ones.   

9. All beasts of the field come to devour, all beasts in the forest!

10. His watchmen are blind; they all do not know; they are all dumb dogs; they cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber;

11. yea, dogs greedy of soul; they do not know satisfaction. And they are shepherds; they know not discernment; they all look to their own way, each one for his own gain, from his own end, saying:

12. Come, and let me bring wine, and let us gulp down fermented drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, great, exceedingly abundant.  

## Isaiah 57

1. The righteous one perishes, and no one lays it to heart; yea, merciful men are gathered, with no one discerning that the righteous is gathered from the face of evil.

2. He shall enter peace; they shall rest on their couches, walking in his uprightness.   

3. But you, draw near here, sons of the sorceress, seed of the adulterer and playing the harlot.

4. On whom are you making sport? On whom do you make a wide mouth and draw out the tongue? Are you not children of transgression, a lying seed,

5. being inflamed with idols under every green tree, slaughtering the children in the torrent beds, under the clefts of the rocks?

6. Your lot is in the torrent's smoothness; they, they are your portion; even to them you have poured a drink offering; you have offered a food offering. Should I be consoled over these?

7. You have set your couch on a lofty and high mountain; yea, you went up there to sacrifice a sacrifice.

8. And you have set up your memorial behind the door and post. For you uncovered yourself from Me and went up; you enlarged your couch; and you cut covenant with them; you loved their couch; at a hand you looked.

9. And you went to the king with oil and multiplied your perfume. And you sent your messengers far away, and lowered yourself to Sheol.

10. You were wearied in the length of your way; you did not say, Despair! You found the life of your hand, so you were not sick.

11. And whom have you dreaded and feared? You have lied and have not remembered Me, not laying it on your heart. Have I not been silent, even from forever, and you have not feared Me?

12. I will reveal your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you.   

13. When you cry, let your gathering deliver you; but the wind shall bear away all of them; vanity takes them. But he who takes refuge in Me shall inherit the land and possess My holy mountain.

14. And he shall say, Raise up! Raise up! Clear the way! Make the stumbling block rise from the way of My people.

15. For so says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, and His name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, even with the contrite and humble of spirit; to make live the spirit of the humble and to make live the heart of the contrite ones.

16. For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry, for the spirit would faint before Me, even the breaths I have made.   

17. For I was angry and struck him for the iniquity of his gain; I hid Myself and was angry; yet he went, turning in his heart's way.

18. His ways I have seen, but I will heal him, and will lead him and restore comforting to him and to his mourners.

19.  I create the fruit of the lips: peace, peace, to the ones far off and near, says Jehovah, and I will heal him.

20. But the wicked are like the driven sea, which cannot be quiet, and its waves cast up mire and dirt.

21. There is no peace to the wicked, says my God.  

## Isaiah 58

1. Call out with the throat! Do not spare. Lift up your voice like the ram's horn! And show My people their rebellion, and their sins to the house of Jacob.

2. Yet they seek Me day by day, and desire knowledge of My ways. As a nation that has done right, and not forsaking the judgment of their God, they ask Me about judgments of righteousness; they desire to draw near to God.   

3.  They say , Why have we fasted, and You did not see? We have afflicted our soul, and You did not acknowledge. Behold, on the day of your fast you find pleasure; and you drive all your laborers hard.

4. Look! You fast for strife, and for debate, and to strike with the fist of wickedness. Do not fast as today, to sound your voice in the high place.

5. Is this like the fast I will choose, a day for a man to afflict his soul? To bow his head down like a bulrush, and he spreads sackcloth and ashes? Will you call to this as a fast and a day of delight to Jehovah?

6.  Is this not the fast I have chosen: to open bands of wickedness, to undo thongs of the yoke, and to let the oppressed ones go free; even that you pull off every yoke?

7.  Is it not to break your bread to the hungry, that you should bring the wandering poor home? When will you see the naked and cover him; and you will not hide yourself from your flesh?   

8. Then your light shall break as the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of Jehovah shall gather you.

9. Then you shall call, and Jehovah will answer; you shall cry, and He shall say, Here I am . If you put the yoke away from among you, the sending out of the finger, and the speaking of vanity;

10. and if you let out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then your light shall rise in the darkness, and your gloom shall be as the noonday.

11. And Jehovah shall always guide you, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and support your bones. And you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters do not fail.

12. And those who come of you shall build the old ruins; you shall rear the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to live in.   

13. If you turn your foot away because of the sabbath, from doing what you please on My holy days, and call the sabbath a delight, glorified to the holiness of doing your own ways, from finding your own pleasure or speaking  your word;

14. then you shall delight yourself in Jehovah. And I will cause you to ride on the heights of the earth, and make you eat with the inheritance of your father Jacob. For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.  

## Isaiah 59

1. Behold, the hand of Jehovah is not shortened from saving, nor is His ear heavy from hearing.

2. But your iniquities are coming between you and your God; and your sins have hidden His face from you, from hearing.

3. For your hands are defiled by blood; yea, your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken falsehood; your tongue murmurs perverseness.

4. No one calls for righteousness; and no one pleads with truth. Trusting emptiness, and speaking vanity, they conceive mischief, and give birth to evil.

5. They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web; he who eats their eggs dies; and that which is crushed hatches out a viper.

6. Their webs shall not become clothing, nor shall they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of evil, and the act of violence is in their hands.

7. Their feet run to evil, and they hurry to pour out innocent blood. Thoughts of iniquity are their thoughts; wasting and ruin are in their tracks.

8. They do not know the way of peace; and no justice is in their tracks. They have made crooked paths for themselves; everyone going in them does not know peace.   

9. For this reason justice is far from us; and righteousness does not overtake us. We wait for light, but, behold, dimness; for brightness, but we walk in gloom.

10. We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes; we stumble at noonday as in the twilight, in deserted places like the dead.

11. We all of us roar like bears, and we moan sadly like doves. We look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.

12. For our trespasses are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities;

13. transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and departing from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and murmuring words of falsehood from the heart.

14. And justice is driven back; and righteousness stands far off; for truth stumbles in the plaza, and right is not able to enter.

15. And the truth is lacking; and whoever turns from evil makes himself a prey. And Jehovah saw; and it was evil in His eyes, that there was no justice.   

16. And He saw that there was no man, and He was astonished that there was no intercessor. And His own arm saved for Him; and His righteousness sustained Him.

17. For He put on righteousness like armor, and a helmet of salvation on His head. And He put on robes of vengeance as clothing; and He put on zeal like a mantle.

18. According to works, so He will repay; fury to His foes; recompense to His foes; He will repay recompense to the coasts.

19. So they shall fear Jehovah's name from the sunset, and His glory from the sunrise. When the foe comes like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah shall cause him to flee.

20. And the Redeemer comes to Zion, and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression, declares Jehovah.

21. As for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah: My Spirit who is on you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your seed, or out of the mouth of your seed's seed, from now on and forever, says Jehovah.  

## Isaiah 60

1. Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of Jehovah has risen on you!

2. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples. But Jehovah shall rise on you, and His glory shall be seen on you.

3. And nations shall walk to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawning.

4. Lift up your eyes all around and see; they are all assembling; they are coming to you. Your sons shall come from far away, and your daughters shall be supported on the side.

5. Then you shall fear and be bright; and your heart shall dread and swell. For the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you; the wealth of nations shall come to you.

6. A host of camels shall cover you, young camels of Midian and Ephah. All of them shall come from Sheba, they shall carry gold and incense; and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.

7. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you; rams of Nebaioth shall serve you; they shall come up for acceptance on My altar; and I will glorify the house of My glory.

8. Who are these who fly like a cloud, and with the doves to their windows?   

9. For the coastlands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish at the first, to bring your sons from far away, their silver and their gold to them, to the name of Jehovah your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.

10. And the sons of the stranger shall build your walls; and their kings shall serve you. For I struck you in My wrath, but I pitied you in My favor.

11. So your gates shall be always open; they shall not be shut day or night, so that men may bring to you the force of nations, and that their kings may be led.

12. For the nations and the kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yea, the nations shall be utterly destroyed.

13. The glory of Lebanon shall come to you: the juniper, the box tree, and the cypress together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; yea, I will glorify the place of My feet.

14. Also the sons of your afflicters shall come bowing to you. And all who despised you shall fall at the soles of your feet. And they shall call you, The City of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.   

15. Instead of your being forsaken and hated, so that no one passes through, I will make you for everlasting majesty, a joy of many generations.

16. You shall also suck the milk of nations, and you shall suck the breast of kings. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

17. Instead of bronze, I will bring gold; and instead of iron, I will bring silver. And instead of timber, bronze; and instead of stones, iron. And I will make your governors peace, and your exacters righteousness.

18. Violence shall not still be heard in your land, or wasting and ruin within your borders; but you shall call your walls, Salvation, and your gates, Praise.

19. The sun shall not still be your light by day, or the brightness of the moon give you light; but Jehovah shall be for everlasting light to you, and your God for your beauty.

20. Your sun shall not set any more; and your moon shall not withdraw; for Jehovah will become your everlasting light; and the days of your mourning shall end.

21. And your people shall all be righteous; they shall possess the earth forever, a branch of My planting, a work of My hands, to beautify Myself.

22. A little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation. I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.  

## Isaiah 61

1. The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is on Me, because Jehovah has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the meek. He has sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to captives, and complete opening to the bound ones;

2. to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;

3. to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give them beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of the spirit of infirmity, so that one calls them trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, in order to beautify Himself.   

4. And they shall build old ruins; they shall raise up former desolations; and they shall restore the waste cities, ruins of generations and generations.

5. And foreigners shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of strangers shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

6. But you shall be called, Priests of Jehovah; it will be said of you, Ministers of our God. You shall eat the riches of the nations, and you shall revel in their glory.

7. Instead of your shame and disgrace, double. They rejoice in their portion; for they shall possess a second time in their land; everlasting joy shall be theirs.

8. For I, Jehovah, love judgment, hating plunder in burnt offering. And I will give their work in truth; and I will cut an everlasting covenant for them.

9. And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed that Jehovah has blessed.   

10. I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah. My soul shall be joyful in my God. For He clothed me with garments of salvation; He put on me the robe of righteousness, even as a bridegroom puts on his ornament, and as the bride is adorned with her jewels.

11. For as the earth comes out with her buds, and as a garden causes that which is sown to grow, so the Lord Jehovah will make righteousness and praise to grow before all the nations.  

## Isaiah 62

1. For Zion's sake, I will not be silent; and for Jerusalem's sake, I will not rest; until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning lamp.

2. And nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. And you shall be called by a new name which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.

3. You also shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the palm of your God.

4. You no longer shall be called Forsaken; nor shall your land any longer be called Desolate. But you shall be called, My Delight is in Her; and your land, Married. For Jehovah delights in you, and your land is married.

5. For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you. And as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God shall rejoice over you.   

6. I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem. All the day and all the night they shall not always be silent; you who remember Jehovah, do not let a pause be to you.

7. And give no pause to Him until He sets up and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

8. Jehovah has sworn by His right hand, and by the might of His arm: Surely I will no longer give your grain as food for your enemies; and the sons of a stranger shall not drink your new wine for which you have labored.

9. But those who have gathered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah. And they who have collected it shall drink it in My holy courts.   

10. Pass! Pass through the gates; prepare the way of the people! Raise up! Raise up the highway; clear it from stones; lift up a banner over the peoples.

11. Behold, Jehovah has made it to be heard to the end of the earth; Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold! Your salvation comes! Behold! His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.

12. And they shall call them, The Holy People, the Redeemed of Jehovah. And to you it shall be called, Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.  

## Isaiah 63

1. Who is this who comes from Edom with dyed garments from Bozrah, this One adorned in His clothing, bending in His great power? It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save!

2. Why is Your clothing red, and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress?

3. I have trodden the winepress, I alone, and no man of the peoples was with Me. And I will tread them in My anger, and trample them in My fury; and their juice shall be spattered on My garments; and I will pollute all My clothes.

4. For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come.

5. And I looked, and no one was helping. And I wondered that no one was upholding. Then My own arm saved for Me, and My fury upheld Me.

6. And I trod down the people in My anger, and made them drunk in My fury. And I poured their juice to the earth.   

7. I will mention the mercies of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has benefited us, and the great good to the house of Israel, by which He benefited them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His loving-kindness.

8. For He said, Surely they are My people, sons that do not lie, and He is their Savior.

9. In all their affliction, He was not a foe; and the Angel of his Face saved them. In His love and in His pity He redeemed them. And He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.

10. But they rebelled, and provoked His Holy Spirit, so He was turned to be their enemy; He fought against them.

11. Then His people remembered the days past of Moses and His people, saying , Where is He who brought us up from the sea with the shepherd of His flock. Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within him;

12. who led them by Moses' right hand, with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make for Him an everlasting name?

13. He led them through the deeps; like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble.

14. As the cattle go down into the valley, so the Spirit of Jehovah caused him to rest; so You led Your people, to make a glorious name for Yourself.   

15. Look down from Heaven and peer from the place of Your holiness and your glory. Where is Your zeal and Your might? The stirring of Your affections and Your mercies toward me, are they held back?

16. For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us; You, Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.

17. O Jehovah, why do You make us wander from Your ways? You harden our heart from Your fear. For Your servants' sake, return the tribes of Your inheritance.

18. For a little while Your holy people possessed it. Our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.

19. We are of old; You never ruled over them. Your name was never called on them.  

## Isaiah 64

1. Oh that You would tear the heavens and come down, that mountains would quake before You.

2.  As the brushwood fire burns and fire causes water to boil, make known Your name to Your foes, that nations might tremble before You.

3. When You did terrifying things which we did not look for, You came down; mountains flowed down before You.

4. And from forever they have not heard; they did not give ear. Eye has not seen a God except You, who works for him who waits for Him.

5. You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness; they recall You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned. In I them is eternity, we shall be saved.   

6. But we are all as the unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth. And we all fade as a leaf, and like the wind our iniquities take us away.

7. And there is not one who calls on Your name, who stirs himself up to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away into the hand of our iniquities.

8. But now, Jehovah, You are our Father. We are the clay, and You are our Former; yea, we all are Your handiwork.

9. Do not be extremely angry, Jehovah, and do not remember iniquity forever. Behold! look, please; all of us are Your people.

10. Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness; Jerusalem is a desolation.

11. The house of our holiness and our beauty where our fathers praised You has become a burning of fire, and all our pleasant things have become a ruin.

12. Will You restrain Yourself over these things , Jehovah? Will you be silent and sorely afflict us?  

## Isaiah 65

1. I have been sought, not by those who asked. I have been found, not by those who sought Me. To a nation not calling on My name, I said, Behold Me! Behold Me!

2. I have spread out My hands all the day long to a rebellious people who walk in the way not good, after their own thoughts;

3. a people who continually provoke Me to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on the bricks;

4. who sit among the graves and lodge in the towers; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of unclean things in their pots;

5. who say, Keep to yourself! Do not come near me, for I am holier than you! These are a smoke in My nose, a fire burning all the day.

6. Behold! It is written before Me: I will not be silent, except I repay; yea, I will repay to their bosom,

7. our iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah; they that burned incense on the mountains, and have blasphemed Me on the hills. And I will measure their former work on their bosom.   

8. So says Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do for the sake of My servants, not to destroy the whole.

9. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one to inherit My mountains. And My chosen one shall inherit, and My servants shall live there.

10. And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks; and the valley of Achor a resting place of herds for My people who have sought Me.   

11. But you are those who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain; who array a table for Fortune, and who fill mixed wine for Fate.

12. And I will number you to the sword; and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because I called and you did not answer. I spoke, and you did not hear; and you did the evil in My eyes; and you chose that in which I had no pleasure.

13. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.

14. Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry from heartbreak, and howl from breaking of spirit.

15. And you shall leave your name for a curse to My chosen. And the Lord Jehovah shall kill you; and He shall call His servants by another name.

16.  He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former distresses are forgotten; and because they are hidden from My eyes.   

17. For, behold, I create new heavens and new earth. And the things before shall not be recalled, and they shall not go up on the heart.

18. However, be glad and rejoice forever in what I create. For, behold, I create in Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

19. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people. And the voice of weeping and the voice of crying shall no longer be heard in her.

20. There shall not still be an infant of days, or an old man that has not filled his days. For the youth shall die the son of a hundred years, but the sinner the son of a hundred years shall be accursed.

21. And they shall build houses and live in them ; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

22. They shall not build, and another live in them ; they shall not plant, and another eat. For like the days of the tree are the days of My people; and My elect shall grow old to the work of their hands.

23. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for terror. For they are the seed of the beloved ones of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.

24. And it will be, before they call, I will answer. While they are speaking, then I will hear.

25. The wolf and the lamb shall feed as one; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And dust is the food of the snake. They shall not do evil nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.  

## Isaiah 66

1. So says Jehovah: Heaven is My throne, and earth the footstool of My feet. Where then is the house that you build for Me? And where then is the place of My rest?

2. And My hand has made all these things, even all these things exist, declares Jehovah. But I will look toward this one, to the afflicted, and to the contrite of spirit, even trembling at My word.

3. He who kills an ox is as if he struck a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dog's neck; he who offers a present is as if it were swine's blood; he who marks incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their way, and their soul delights in their abominations.

4. I also will choose their vexations; and I will bring their fears to them; because I called, and no one answered; I spoke, and they did not hear. But they did the evil in My eyes, and chose that in which I had no pleasure.   

5. Hear the word of Jehovah, those who tremble at His word. Your brothers who hate you, who drive you out for My name's sake, have said, Jehovah is glorified. But He shall appear in your joy, and they shall be ashamed.

6. A roaring sound from the city! A sound from the temple! It is the sound of Jehovah repaying retribution to His enemies.

7. Before she travailed, she brought forth; before pain came to her, she delivered a male child.

8. Who has heard a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Shall the earth be brought forth in one day? Shall a nation be born in one step? For Zion travailed and also brought forth her sons.

9. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Jehovah. Surely I cause birth, and hold back, says your God.

10. Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all who love her. Rejoice a rejoicing with her, all who mourn for her;

11. that you may suck and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may milk out and delight yourselves with the fullness of her glory.

12. For so says Jehovah: Behold, I stretch out peace to her like a river, and glory of nations like an overflowing torrent. And You shall suck; you shall be carried on the side and be dandled on knees.

13. As a man whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you. And you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

14. And you will see, and your heart shall rejoice; and your bones shall flourish like the grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward His servants, and He shall be indignant with His enemies.   

15. For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and His chariots like the tempest, to return His wrath in fury, and His rebuke in flames of fire.

16. For by fire and by His sword Jehovah will execute judgment with all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.

17. Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to the gardens, each one in the midst, eaters of swine's flesh, and the hateful thing, and the mouse, these are cut off together, says Jehovah.

18. For I know their works and their thoughts; it comes to gather all the nations and the tongues; and they shall come and see My glory.

19. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape from them to the nations of Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawers of the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the far away coasts that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the nations.

20. And they shall bring all your brothers out of all nations, an offering to Jehovah, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah; as the sons of Israel bring the offering in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.

21. And I will also take some of them for the priests, for the Levites, says Jehovah.

22. For as the new heavens and the new earth which I make stand before Me, declares Jehovah, so your seed and your name shall stand.

23. And it will be, from new moon to its new moon, and from sabbath to its sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before Me, says Jehovah.

24. And they shall go out and see the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be put out; and they shall be an object of disgust to all flesh.
