# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1. The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.

2. Beloved, in regard to all things, I pray for you to prosper and to be in health, as your soul prospers.   

3. For I rejoiced greatly at the coming of the brothers, also bearing witness of you in the truth, as you walk in truth.

4. I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear my children are walking in truth.

5. Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you work for the brothers and for the strangers,

6. who in love bore witness of you before the church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God.

7. For on behalf of His name they went out, taking nothing from the nations.

8. Therefore, we ought to entertain such men , that we may become co-workers in the truth.   

9. I wrote to the church, but he loving to be first of them, Diotrephes, does not receive us.

10. Because of this, if I come, I will recall his works which he does, ranting against us with evil words. And not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers; and those intending it he prevents, and thrusts them out from the church.

11. Beloved, do not imitate the bad, but the good. The one doing good is of God; but the one doing bad has not seen God.   

12. Witness has been borne to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.

13. I had many things to write, but I do not desire to write by means of pen and ink.

14. But I am hoping to see you at once, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
