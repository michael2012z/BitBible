# Zechariah

## Zechariah 1

1. In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

2. Jehovah has been very angry with your fathers.

3. And you say to them, So says Jehovah of hosts: Turn to Me, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will turn to you, says Jehovah of hosts.

4. Do not be as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have proclaimed to them, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts: Turn now from your evil ways and your evil doings. But they did not hear or give heed to Me, says Jehovah.

5. Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

6. But My words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said, As Jehovah of hosts purposes to do to us, according to our ways and according to our deeds, so He has done with us.   

7. On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, it is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah was to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

8. I saw at night. And, behold! A Man riding on a red horse. And He stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine. And behind Him were red, sorrel, and white horses.

9. Then I said, My lord, what are these? And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, I will show you what these are .

10. And the Man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

11. And they answered the Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still and is at peace.

12. And the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, until when will You not have pity on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah, against which You have cursed these seventy years?

13. And Jehovah answered the angel who was talking with me with good words, comforting words.

14. So the angel who was talking with me said to me, Cry out, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion, with a great jealousy.

15. And with great anger I am angry at the nations at ease; in that I was but a little angry, and they gave help for evil.

16. So Jehovah says this: I have returned to Jerusalem with compassions; My house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched over Jerusalem.

17. Cry out again, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with goodness, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.   

18. Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, four horns!

19. And I said to the angel who was talking with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

20. And Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.

21. And I said, What are these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horn over the land of Judah, to scatter it.  

## Zechariah 2

1. I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and, behold, A man, and a measuring line in his hand!

2. And I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what its length.

3. And, behold, the angel who was talking with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,

4. and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited, as towns without walls, for the multitude of men and livestock in her midst.

5. And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, and I will be for glory in her midst, declares Jehovah.   

6. Ho! Ho! Flee then from the land of the north, says Jehovah. For I have scattered you as the four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.

7. Ho, O Zion! Escape, you who live with the daughter of Babylon.

8. For so says Jehovah of hosts: He has sent Me after glory, to the nations who plundered you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.

9. For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a prize for their servants. And you shall know that Jehovah has sent Me.   

10. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For, lo, I come; and I will dwell among you, says Jehovah.

11. And many nations shall be joined to Jehovah in that day, and they shall be My people. And I will dwell among you; and you shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.

12. And Jehovah shall possess Judah, His portion in the holy land, and He shall again choose Jerusalem.

13. All flesh, be silent before Jehovah. For He is raised up out of His holy habitation.  

## Zechariah 3

1. And he made me see Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.

2. And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! And, Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?

3. And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and he stood before the Angel.

4. And He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And He said to him, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with ceremonial robes.

5. And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. And they set a clean turban on his head and clothed him with clothing. And the Angel of Jehovah stood by.

6. And the Angel of Jehovah charged Joshua, saying,

7. So says Jehovah of hosts: If you will walk in My ways, and if you will keep My charge, then you shall also judge My house, and shall also keep My courts, and I will give you room to walk among these who stand by.   

8. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who are sitting before you; for they are men of symbol.

9. For, behold, I will bring forth My Servant, the BRANCH. For behold, the stone which I have given before Joshua, on the one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, says Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

10. In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, you shall invite each man to his neighbor to sit under the vine and under the fig tree.  

## Zechariah 4

1. And the angel who was speaking with me returned and awakened me, as a man is awakened out of his sleep.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand, all of it gold, and a bowl on its top, and its seven lamps on it, and seven spouts each to the seven lamps on its top;

3. and two olive trees are beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.

4. And I answered and spoke to the angel who was talking with me, saying, What are these, my lord?

5. And the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are ? And I said, No, my lord.

6. Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.

7. Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts: Grace! Grace to it!

8. And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,

9. The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it . And you shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you.

10. For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah; they run to and fro through all the earth.   

11. And I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand, and on its left?

12. And I answered a second time and said to him, What are the two clusters of olives beside the two golden pipes, emptying the golden oil from themselves?

13. And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are ? And I said, No, my lord.

14. And he said, These are the two sons of fresh oil who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.  

## Zechariah 5

1. And I again lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, a flying scroll!

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.

3. And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For from now on everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be cut off according to it.

4. And I will bring it forth, says Jehovah of hosts. And it shall go into the house of the thief, and into the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall devour it, and its timber, and its stones.   

5. Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.

6. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This is their form in all the earth.

7. And, behold, a lead cover was lifted up, and a woman was sitting in the middle of the ephah.

8. And he said, This is wickedness. And he threw her into the midst of the ephah; and he threw the lead stone over its opening.

9. And I lifted up my eyes and looked. And, behold, two women came out. And the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of the stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.

10. And I said to the angel who was speaking with me, Where are they going with the ephah?

11. And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be fixed and established there on its own place.  

## Zechariah 6

1. And again my eyes lifted up and looked, and, behold, four chariots were coming from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.

2. With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot black horses,

3. and with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth dappled and strong colored horses.

4. And I answered and said to the angel who was talking with me, What are these, my lord?

5. And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of Heaven who go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.

6. The black horses in it go into the north country, and the white go after them; and the dappled ones go toward the south country.

7. And the strong colored ones went forth and sought to go, to walk to and fro in the earth. And he said, Go! Walk to and fro in the earth. So they walked to and fro in the earth.

8. And he cried out to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these who go toward the north country have caused My Spirit to rest in the north country.   

9. And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,

10. Take from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, from the exiles who have come from Babylon; and in that day you go and enter into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah.

11. And take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

12. And speak to him, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold! The Man whose name is THE BRANCH! And He shall spring up out of His place, and He shall build the temple of Jehovah.

13. Even He shall build the temple of Jehovah; and He shall bear the majesty, and shall sit and rule on His throne. And He shall be a priest on His throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between the two of them.

14. And the crowns shall be for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah, to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah.

15. And the distant ones shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah. And you shall know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall be, if you will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.  

## Zechariah 7

1. And in the fourth year of king Darius, the word of Jehovah was to Zechariah, in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chislev.

2. And Sharezer and Regem-melech, and his men, had sent to Bethel to seek the favor of the face of Jehovah,

3. to speak to the priests who belong to the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, consecrating myself as I have done these many years?

4. The word of Jehovah of hosts was to me, saying,

5. Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months , even those seventy years, did you truly fast to Me, even to Me?

6. And when you ate, and when you drank, was it not for those eating, and for those drinking?

7. Are not these the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited, and prosperous with her cities all around her, and the Negeb and the Shephelah were inhabited?   

8. And the word of Jehovah was to Zechariah, saying,

9. So says Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge true judgment, and practice kindness and pity, each man with his brother.

10. And do not oppress the widow, or the fatherless, the alien, or the poor. And do not devise evil in your heart, of a man against his brother.

11. But they refused to listen, and gave a stubborn shoulder, and they made their ears heavy from hearing.

12. And they made their heart adamant from hearing the law and the words which Jehovah of hosts has sent by the former prophets through His Spirit. And great wrath was from Jehovah of hosts.

13. And it will be, just as He called, and they did not listen; so they called, and I did not listen, says Jehovah of hosts.

14. But I stormed them away on all the nations whom they did not know. And the land is desolated behind them, from passing and from returning; for they made the land of desire a waste.  

## Zechariah 8

1. And the word of Jehovah was to me , saying,

2. So says Jehovah of hosts: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great wrath.

3. So says Jehovah: I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, the holy mountain.

4. So says Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet be old men and old women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem; and each man with his staff in his hand because of their many days.

5. And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.

6. So says Jehovah of hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be marvelous in My eyes? says Jehovah of hosts.

7. So says Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the rising sun and from the land of the setting sun.

8. And I will bring them, and they shall live in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be for a people to Me, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.   

9. So says Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the house of Jehovah of hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.

10. For before those days there was no payment for man, nor was there payment for animal; and there was no peace to him from the adversary who went out or came in. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.

11. But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in former days, says Jehovah of hosts.

12. For there shall be peace for the seed: the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these.

13. And it shall be, as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.

14. For so says Jehovah of hosts: As I purposed to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says Jehovah of hosts. And I did not repent,

15. So again I have purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem, and the house of Judah. Do not fear.

16. These are the things that you shall do. Let each man speak the truth with his neighbor. Judge with truth and justice for peace in your gates,

17. and let each devise no evil in your heart against his neighbor, and do not love a false oath. For all these I hate, says Jehovah.   

18. And the word of Jehovah of hosts was to me, saying,

19. So says Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall become for joy and gladness and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.

20. So says Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet come peoples, and inhabitants of many cities.

21. And the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, Let us go at once to seek the favor of the face of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts; I will go also.

22. And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to seek the favor of the face of Jehovah.

23. So says Jehovah of hosts: In those days ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold, and will seize the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.  

## Zechariah 9

1. The burden of the word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, and its resting place, Damascus, (when the eye of man, and all the tribes of Israel shall be toward Jehovah),

2. and Hamath also borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.

3. And Tyre shall build a fortress for herself, and shall pile up silver like the dust, and gold like the mud of the streets.

4. Behold! The Lord will expel her, and He will strike her wealth in the sea, and she shall be consumed with fire.

5. Ashkelon shall see and fear; Gaza also shall writhe in great pain; and Ekron shall be ashamed for her hope. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

6. And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

7. And I will take away his bloods out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. But the remnant, even he, shall be for our God. And he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron, like a Jebusite.

8. And I will camp around My house because of an army, because of him who passed by, and because of him who returns. And no tyrant shall pass through them any more. For now I have seen with My eyes.   

9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King comes to you! He is righteous and victorious, lowly, and riding on an ass, even on a colt, the son of an ass.

10. And I Will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace to the nations. And His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

11. Also you, by the blood of your covenant I have freed your prisoners from the pit; no water is in it.   

12. Turn to the stronghold, O prisoners of hope! Even today I declare I will return double to you.

13. For I have bent Judah for Me as a bow; I filled it with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and make you as the sword of a mighty man.

14. Then Jehovah will be seen over them, and His arrow shall go out as lightning; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow the ram's horn and shall go forth with the windstorms of the south.

15. Jehovah of hosts shall defend them. And they shall devour and trample on the slingstones. And they shall drink and be boisterous, as with wine. And they shall be full like a bowl, like the corners of the altar.

16. And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they are as stones of a crown, lifted up as a barrier over His land.

17. For how great is its goodness, and how great its beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.  

## Zechariah 10

1. Ask rain from Jehovah in the time of the latter rain. Jehovah shall make storm clouds; and He gives them showers of rain, grass to everyone in the field.

2. For the family idols speak iniquity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams. They comfort in vain. On account of this, they wandered like a flock. They were troubled because there was no shepherd.

3. My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats. For Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah and made them as His splendid horse in battle.

4. From Him came the cornerstone, from Him the nail, from Him came the battle bow, and from Him every ruler together.   

5. And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and they shall make the riders of horses ashamed.

6. And I will make stronger the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. And I will bring them back again to live, for I have pity on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off, for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.

7. And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall be glad as by wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in Jehovah.

8. I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them. And they shall multiply as they were multiplied.

9. And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in far countries, and they shall live with their sons and return.

10. And I will return to save them out of the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria. And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, for room shall not be found for them.

11. And He shall pass through the sea of distress and strike the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall go away.

12. And I will make them strong in Jehovah, and they shall walk up and down in His name, says Jehovah.  

## Zechariah 11

1. Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that the fire may devour your cedars.

2. Howl, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the majestic trees have been destroyed. Howl, O oaks of Bashan, for the inaccessible forest has come down.

3. A voice of the wailing of the shepherds is heard , for their splendor is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions is heard , for the pride of Jordan is destroyed.   

4. For so says Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of the slaughter.

5. Those who buy them kill them and are not held guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich. And their shepherds do not pity them.

6. For I will never again pity the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah. But, lo, I will make the men fall, each one into his neighbor's hand, and into his king's hand. And they shall strike the land, and I will not deliver out of their hand.

7. And I fed the flock of slaughter, the truly poor of the flock. And I took two staffs for Myself: the one I called Kindness, and the other I called Union. And I fed the flock.

8. I also cut off three shepherds in one month. And My soul despised them, and their soul also detested Me.

9. Then I said, I will not feed you; that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off. And let the rest eat, each woman the flesh of her neighbor.

10. And I took My staff Kindness and broke it apart, to break My covenant which I had cut with all the peoples.

11. And it was broken in that day, and so the poor of the flock who were watching Me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.

12. And I said to them, If it is good in your eyes, give My price; and if not, let it go. And they weighed My price, thirty pieces of silver.

13. And Jehovah said to Me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it to the potter in the house of Jehovah.

14. Then I broke apart My second staff Union, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.   

15. And Jehovah said to me, Again take to yourself the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

16. For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land; he shall not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek the young, nor will he heal that which is broken, nor will he sustain that which stands. But he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear off their hoofs.

17. Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword shall be against his arm and against his right eye. His arm shall be completely withered, and his right eye shall be totally darkened.  

## Zechariah 12

1. The burden of the word of Jehovah for Israel, says Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man in his midst.

2. Behold! I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the peoples all around, and it shall also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.

3. And in that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it shall be slashed. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.

4. In that day I will strike every horse with panic and his rider with madness, says Jehovah. And I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and I will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.

5. And the leaders of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in Jehovah of hosts, their God.

6. In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among cut grain. And they shall devour all the peoples all around, on the right hand and on the left hand. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her place, in Jerusalem.

7. Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.

8. In that day Jehovah shall protect around the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And it will be, he who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of Jehovah before them.   

9. And it shall be in that day, I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

10. And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of prayers. And they shall look on Me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son , and they shall be bitter over Him, like the bitterness over the first-born.

11. In that day the mourning in Jerusalem shall be great, like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.

12. And the land shall mourn, each family apart: the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

13. the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

14. all the families who remain, each family apart, and their wives apart.  

## Zechariah 13

1. In that day a fountain shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.

2. And it shall be in that day, I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall be remembered no more, says Jehovah of hosts. And I also will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

3. And it shall be when any shall prophesy again, his father and his mother who gave him birth shall say to him then, You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah. And his father and his mother who gave him birth shall pierce him when he prophesies.

4. And it shall be in that day, the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies, and they shall not wear a hairy garment to deceive.

5. But he shall say, I am not a prophet; I am a man, a tiller of the ground, for a man caused me to buy from my youth.

6. And one shall say to him, What are these wounds between your hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was struck in the house of those who love me.   

7. O sword, awake against My Shepherd, and against the Man who is My companion, says Jehovah of hosts. Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn My hand against the little ones.

8. And it shall be in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts in it shall be cut off and perish, but the third shall be left in it.

9. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined. And I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say, It is My people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.  

## Zechariah 14

1. Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, and your spoil shall be divided among you.

2. For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem. And the city shall be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished. And half the city shall go into exile and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.

3. And Jehovah shall go out and fight against those nations, like the day He fought in the day of battle.

4. And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall divide from its middle, from the east even to the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

5. And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the saints with You.

6. And it will be in that day, there shall not be light; the glorious ones will shrink.

7. And it will be, one day which shall be known to Jehovah; not day and not night, but it will be, there will be light at evening time.   

8. And it shall be in that day, living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them shall go toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.

9. And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth. In that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name one.

10. All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And it shall rise and dwell in its place, from Benjamin's Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.

11. And they shall live in it. And there shall not again be a shutting in, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.

12. And this shall be the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rest in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot in their mouths.

13. And it shall be in that day, a great panic of Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall each one lay hold of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.

14. And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of the surrounding nations shall be gathered, gold, and silver, and clothing, very much.

15. And so shall be the plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the beasts which shall be in those camps, like this plague.   

16. And it shall be, everyone who is left from all the nations which came up against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

17. And it shall be, whoever will not go up from the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, there shall even be no rain on them.

18. And if the family of Egypt does not go up, nor come in, then the rain shall not be on them, but the plague with which Jehovah shall strike the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

19. This shall be Egypt's offense, and the offense of all nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

20. In that day there shall be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO JEHOVAH. And the pots in the house of Jehovah shall be like the bowls before the altar.

21. And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them. And in that day there shall not be a trader in the house of Jehovah of hosts any more.
