# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Since many took in hand to draw up an account concerning the matters having been borne out among us,

2. as those from the beginning delivered to us, becoming eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,

3. it seemed good also to me, having traced out all things accurately from the first, to write in order to you, most excellent Theophilus,

4. that you may know the certainty concerning the words which you were taught.   

5. In the days of Herod the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the daily course of Abijah. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

7. And no child was born to them, because Elizabeth was barren. And both were advanced in their days.

8. And it happened in his serving as priest in the order of his course before God,

9. according to the custom of the priests, entering into the Holy Place of the Lord, it was Zacharias' lot to burn incense.

10. And all the multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.

11. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.

12. And seeing this , Zacharias was troubled, and fear fell on him.

13. But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias, because your prayer was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John.

14. And he will be joy and exultation to you, and many will rejoice over his birth.

15. For he shall be great in the eyes of the Lord, and he shall not drink wine or strong drink. And he will be filled of the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

16. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.

17. And he will go out before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah "to turn the hearts of fathers to their children," and disobedient ones to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people having been prepared for the Lord. Mal. 4:5, 6

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am old and my wife is advanced in her days.

19. And answering, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you the good news of these things.

20. And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their season.

21. And the people were expecting Zacharias, and they wondered at his delay in the Holy Place.

22. But coming out, he was not able to speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Place. And he was making signs to them and continued dumb.

23. And it happened when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went away to his house.

24. And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived. And she hid herself five months, saying,

25. So has the Lord done to me in the days in which He looked on me to take away my reproach among men.   

26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,

27. to a virgin who had been betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mariam.

28. And entering, the angel said to her, Hail, one having received grace! The Lord is with you. You are blessed among women!

29. And seeing this , she was disturbed at his word, and considered what kind of greeting this might be.

30. And the angel said to her, Do not fear, Mariam, for you have found favor from God.

31. And behold! You will conceive in your womb and bear a Son, and you will call His name Jesus.

32. This One will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.

33. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there will be no end.

34. But Mariam said to the angel, How will this be since I do not know a man?

35. And answering, the angel said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, and for this reason that Holy One being born of you will be called Son of God.

36. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth! She also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;

37. for nothing shall be impossible with God.

38. And Mariam said, Behold, the slave of the Lord! May it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.   

39. And rising up in these days, Mariam went into the hill country with haste to a city of Judah.

40. And she entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.

41. And it happened, as Elizabeth heard Mariam's greeting, the babe in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled of the Holy Spirit.

42. And she cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!

43. And why is this to me that the mother of my Lord comes to me?

44. For behold, as the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped in exultation.

45. And blessed is she believing, because there will be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord.

46. And Mariam said, My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. and my spirit exulted in God My Savior.

48. For He looked upon the humiliation of His slave woman. For, behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed. 1 Sam. 1:11

49. For the Mighty One did great things to me, and holy is His name.

50. And His mercy is to generations of generations to those fearing Him. Psa. 103:17

51. He performed mightily with His arm; He scattered proud ones in the thought of their heart.

52. He put down powerful ones from thrones, and exalted lowly ones.

53. He filled the hungry with good things, and He sent the rich away empty.

54. He helped His servant Israel in order to remember mercy,

55. even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.

56. And Mariam remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.   

57. And the time was fulfilled to Elizabeth for her to bear, and she bore a son.

58. And the neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.

59. And it happened on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child and were calling it by his father's name, Zacharias.

60. And his mother answered, saying, Not so, but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her, No one is among your kindred who is called by this name.

62. And they signaled to his father, what he might desire him to be called.

63. And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And all marveled.

64. And instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he spoke, blessing God.

65. And fear came on all those living around them. And in all the hill country of Judea all these things were talked about.

66. And all who heard laid them up in their hearts, saying, What then will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.   

67. And his father Zacharias was filled of the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He visited and worked redemption for His people.

69. And He raised up a Horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David;

70. even as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from the age before :

71. Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all those hating us,

72. to execute mercy with our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,

73.  the oath which He swore to our father Abraham,

74. to give to us, that we being delivered out of our enemies' hand, in order to serve Him without fear,

75. in consecration and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.

76. And you, child, will be called Prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, Mal. 3:1

77. to give a knowledge of salvation to His people by remission of their sins,

78. through the tender bowels of mercy of our God, in which the Dayspring from on high will visit us,

79. to appear to those sitting in darkness and in shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace. Isa. 9:2

80. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit. And he was in the deserts until the day of his showing to Israel.  

## Luke 2

1. And it happened in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the habitable world to be registered.

2. This registration first occurred under the governing of Syria by Cyrenius.

3. And all went to be registered, each to his own city.

4. And Joseph also went from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of David,

5. to be registered with Mariam, she having been betrothed to him as wife, she being pregnant.

6. And it happened as they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bear.

7. And she bore her son, the First-born. And she wrapped Him and laid Him in the manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.   

8. And shepherds were in the same country living in the fields and keeping guard over their flock by night.

9. And, behold, an angel of the Lord came on them. And the glory of the Lord shone around them. And they feared with a great fear.

10. And the angel said to them, Do not fear. For, behold, I announce good news to you, a great joy, which will be to all people,

11. because today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born to you in the city of David.

12. And this is a sign to you: You will find a babe having been wrapped, lying in the manger.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,

14. Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, good will among men.

15. And it happened as the angels departed from them into the heaven, even the men, the shepherds, said to one another, Indeed, let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this thing which has occurred, which the Lord made known to us.

16. And hurrying, they came and sought out both Mariam and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.

17. And seeing, they publicly told about the word spoken to them about this Child.

18. And all those hearing marveled about the things spoken to them by the shepherds.

19. And Mariam kept all these words, meditating in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they heard and saw, even as was spoken to them.   

21. And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child His name was called Jesus, the name called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of her cleansing according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord,

23. as it has been written in the Law of the Lord: Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord; Ex. 13:2

24. and to offer a sacrifice according to that said in the Law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two nestlings of doves. Lev. 12:8   

25. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, eagerly expecting the Consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him.

26. And it happened to him, having been divinely instructed by the Holy Spirit, he was not to see death before he would see the Christ of the Lord.

27. And by the Spirit he came into the temple. And as the parents were bringing in the child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the Law concerning Him,

28. even Simeon received Him into his arms. And he blessed God and said,

29. Now, Master, You will let Your slave go in peace according to Your word;

30. because my eyes saw Your Salvation,

31. which You prepared before the face of all the peoples;

32. a Light for revelation to the nations, and the Glory of Your people Israel.

33. And Joseph was marveling, also His mother, at the things being said concerning Him.

34. And Simeon blessed them and said to His mother Mariam, Behold, this One is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against;

35. yea, a sword also will pierce your own soul, so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in many days, having lived seven years with a husband from her virginity;

37. and she was a widow of eighty four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.

38. And coming on at the very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Him to all those in Jerusalem eagerly expecting redemption.

39. And as they finished all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to Nazareth their city.

40. And the Child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was upon Him.   

41. And His parents went into Jerusalem year by year at the Feast of the Passover.

42. And when He was twelve years old , they, going up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast,

43. and fulfilling the days, in their returning, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know.

44. But supposing Him to be in the company, they went a day on the way. And they looked for Him among the relatives and friends.

45. And not finding Him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for Him.

46. And it happened after three days they found Him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers, even hearing them and questioning them.

47. And all those hearing Him were amazed at His intelligence and His answers.

48. And seeing Him, they were astounded. And His mother said to Him, Child, why did You do so to us? Behold, Your father and I were looking for You, greatly distressed.

49. And He said to them, Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I must be busy in the affairs of My Father?

50. And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.

51. And He went with them and came to Nazareth and was being subject to them. And His mother carefully kept all these words in her heart.

52. And Jesus progressed in wisdom and stature and favor before God and men. see 1 Sam. 2:26  

## Luke 3

1. And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate governing Judea, and Herod ruling as tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruling as tetrarch of Iturea and the Trachonitis country, and Lysanias ruling as tetrarch of Abilene,

2. upon the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came on John the son of Zacharias in the desert.

3. And he came into the neighborhood of the Jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for remission of sins,

4. as it has been written in the roll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: " the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.

5. every valley shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made into straight, and the rough into smooth ways;"

6. "and all flesh shall see the salvation of God." Isa. 40:35

7. Then he said to the crowds going out to be baptized by him, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Then bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.

9. And also the axe is already laid to the root of the trees; therefore, every tree not producing good fruit is being cut down and being thrown into the fire.

10. And the crowd asked him, saying, What then shall we do?

11. And answering, he said to them, The one that has two tunics, let him give to him that has not. And the one that has foods, let him do the same.

12. And tax collectors also came to be baptized. And they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them, Continue to do no more than that commanded to you.

14. And also ones serving as soldiers asked him, saying, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not shake violently anyone nor accuse falsely, and be satisfied with your pay.   

15. But the people were expecting, and all reasoning in their hearts about John, lest perhaps he is the Christ,

16. John answered all, saying, I indeed baptize you with water; but He stronger than I comes, of whom I am not fit to loosen the thong of His sandals. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,

17. whose sifting fan is in His hand; and He will fully purge His threshing-floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn, but He will burn: the chaff with fire that cannot be put out.

18. And then indeed exhorting many different things, he preached the gospel to the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning his brother Philip's wife, Herodias, and concerning all the evil things Herod did,

20. he also added this above all, he even shut up John in the prison.   

21. And it happened, in the baptizing of all the people, Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened;

22. and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily form as a dove upon Him. And there was a voice out of Heaven, saying, You are My Son, the Beloved; I am delighted in You. Psa. 2:7; Gen 22:2; Isa. 42:1

23. And Jesus Himself was beginning to be about thirty years old, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,

24. the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph,

25. the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,

26. the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,

27. the son of Joannas, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,

28. the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,

29. the son of Joses, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,

30. the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,

31. the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,

32. the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,

33. the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Pharez, the son of Judah,

34. the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,

35. the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Salah,

36. the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,

37. the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan;

38.  son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.  

## Luke 4

1. And full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.

2. forty days, being tested by the Devil. And He ate nothing in those days, and they being ended, He afterwards hungered.

3. And the Devil said to Him, If You are Son of God, speak to this stone that it become a loaf.

4. And Jesus answered to him, saying, It has been written: "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word of God." Deut. 8:3

5. And leading Him up into a high mountain, the Devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the Devil said to Him, I will give all this authority and their glory to You, because it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.

7. Then if You worship before me, all will be Yours.

8. And answering, to him, Jesus said, Get behind Me, Satan! For it has been written: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve." Deut. 6:13

9. And he led Him to Jerusalem, and stood Him on the wing of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;

10. for it has been written: "He will command His angels about You, even to protect You,"

11. "that on their hands they shall bear You, lest you strike Your foot against a stone." LXX-Psa. 90:11, 12; MT-Psa. 91:11, 12

12. And answering, Jesus said to him, It has been said: "You shall not tempt the Lord your God." Deut. 6:16

13. And having finished every temptation, the Devil departed from Him until a time.   

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee. And a report went out through all the neighborhood about Him.

15. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16. And He came to Nazareth where He was brought up. And as was His custom, He went in on the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue, and He stood up to read.

17. And the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to Him. And unrolling the book, He found the place where it was written:

18. " The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me. Because of this He anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me" to heal the brokenhearted, "to preach remission to captives and new sight to the blind," to send away the ones having been crushed in deliverance,

19. "to preach an acceptable year of the Lord." Isa. 61:1, 2

20. And rolling up the scroll, returning it to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.

21. And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears.

22. And all bore witness to Him, and marveled at the gracious words coming out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not the son of Joseph?

23. And He said to them, Surely you will speak this parable to Me, Physician, heal yourself. What things we heard were happening in Capernaum, do also here in your native place.

24. But He said, Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his native place.

25. But truthfully I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heaven was shut up over three years and six months, when a great famine came on all the land;

26. and yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath of Sidon, to a widow woman.

27. And many lepers were in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was made clean except Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all were filled with anger, hearing these things in the synagogue.

29. And rising up, they threw Him outside the city, and led Him up to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.

30. But He went away, passing through their midst.   

31. And He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And He was teaching them on the sabbaths.

32. And they were astonished at His doctrine, because His word was with authority.

33. And in the synagogue was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,

34. saying, Aha! What is to us and to You, Jesus, Nazarene? Did You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out from him! And throwing him into the midst, the demon came out from him, not harming him.

36. And astonishment came on all. And they spoke with one another, saying, What word is this, that He commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out?

37. And a report about Him went out into every place of the neighborhood.

38. And rising up from the synagogue, He went into the house of Simon. And the mother-in-law of Simon was being seized with a great fever. And they asked Him concerning her.

39. And standing over her, He rebuked the fever; and it left her. And rising up instantly, she served them.

40. And the sun sinking, all, as many as had sick ones with various diseases, brought them to Him. And laying hands on each one of them, He healed them.

41. And also demons came out from many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And rebuking them , He did not allow them to speak, for they knew Him to be the Christ.

42. And day coming, going out, He went into a deserted place. And the crowds looked for Him, and came up to Him, and held Him fast, not to pass away from them.

43. But He said to them, It is right for Me to preach the gospel, the kingdom of God, to the other cities, because I was sent on this mission .

44. And He was proclaiming in the synagogues of Galilee.  

## Luke 5

1. And it happened that the crowd was pressing on Him to hear the Word of God. And He was standing by Lake Gennesaret.

2. And He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had left them and were washing the nets.

3. And entering into one of the boats, which was Simon's, He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He taught the crowd from the boat.

4. And as He quit speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a haul.

5. And answering, Simon said to Him, Master, laboring all through the night we took nothing. But at Your word I will let down the net.

6. And doing this, they netted a great multitude of fish; and their net was being torn.

7. And they signaled the partners, those in the other boat, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.

8. And seeing, Simon Peter fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.

9. For astonishment took hold of him, and all those with him, at the haul of fish which they took;

10. and in the same way also, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear. From now on you will be taking men alive.

11. And bringing the boats down onto the land, forsaking all things, they followed Him.   

12. And it happened, in His being in one of the cities, even behold, a man full of leprosy! And seeing Jesus, falling on his face, he begged Him, saying, Lord, if You choose, You are able to cleanse me.

13. And stretching out the hand, He touched him, saying, I will! Be cleansed! And instantly the leprosy departed from him.

14. And He charged him to tell no one. But going away, show yourself to the priest and offer concerning your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

15. But the word about Him spread even more. And large crowds were coming to hear and to be healed from their infirmities by Him.

16. But He was drawing back in a deserted place , and praying.   

17. And it happened on one of the days, even He was teaching. And Pharisees and teachers of the Law were sitting by, who were coming out of every village of Galilee and Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was there, for the curing of them.

18. And, behold, men carrying on a cot a man who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before Him.

19. And not finding a way through which they might bring him in through the crowd, going up on the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with the cot, into the midst, in front of Jesus.

20. And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins have been forgiven you.

21. And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?

22. But knowing their thoughts, answering Jesus said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Your sins have been forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?

24. But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on the earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic, I say to you, Rise up, and take your cot and go to your house.

25. And rising up at once before them, taking up that on which he was lying, he went to his house glorifying God.

26. And amazement seized all, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We saw wonderful things today.   

27. And after these things, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me!

28. And leaving all, rising up he followed Him.

29. And Levi made a great feast for Him in his house. And there was a crowd of many tax collectors reclining, and of others who were with them.

30. And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured at His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?

31. And answering, Jesus said to them, Those who are sound have no need of a physician, but those who have illness.

32. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

33. But they said to Him, Why do John's disciples fast often, and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but those close to You eat and drink?

34. But He said to them, You are not able to make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them.

35. But days will come, even when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then in those days they will fast.

36. And He also told a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment on an old garment; otherwise both the new will tear, and the old does not match the piece from the new.

37. And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be poured out, and the skins will perish.

38. But new wine is to be put into new skins, and both are preserved together.

39. And no one drinking old wine immediately desires new; for he says, The old is better.  

## Luke 6

1. And it happened on the second chief sabbath, He passed along through the sown fields. And His disciples plucked the heads and were eating, rubbing with the hands.

2. But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbaths?

3. And answering, Jesus said to them, Have you never read this, what David did when he hungered, and those being with him?

4. How he went into the house of God, and he took the Loaves of Arrangement, and ate, and even gave to those with him, which it is not lawful to eat, except only the priests?

5. And He said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also.

6. And it also happened on another sabbath, He going into the synagogue and teaching. And a man was there, and his right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and the Pharisees kept close by Him, to see if He would heal on the sabbath, so that they might find a charge against Him.

8. But He knew their reasonings. And He said to the man having the withered hand, Rise up and stand in the middle! And rising up, he stood.

9. Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbaths, or to do ill, to save a life, or to destroy it ?

10. And having looked around at them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he did so. And his hand was restored sound as the other.

11. But they were filled with madness and talked to one another as to what they might do to Jesus.   

12. And it happened in these days, He went out into the mountain to pray. And He was spending the night in prayer to God.

13. And when it became day, He called His disciples, also choosing out twelve from them, whom He also named apostles:

14. Simon, whom He also named Peter; and his brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;

15. Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alpheus, and Simon, the one being called Zealot;

16. Judas brother of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became the betrayer.

17. And coming down with them, he stood on a level place. And a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of the people were there from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the coast country of Tyre and Sidon. These came to hear Him, and to be healed from their diseases,

18. also those who had been tormented by unclean spirits. And they were healed.

19. And all the crowd sought to touch Him, because power went out from Him and healed all.   

20. And lifting up His eyes to His disciples, He said: Blessed are the poor, for the kingdom of God is yours.

21. Blessed are those hungering now, for you will be filled. Blessed are those weeping now, for you will laugh.

22. Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they cut you off, and will reproach you , and will cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of man;

23. rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold, your reward is much in Heaven! For their fathers did according to these things to the prophets.

24. But woe to you, rich ones, for you have your comfort!

25. Woe to you, those having been filled, for you will hunger! Woe to you, those laughing now, for you will mourn and lament!

26. Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers did according to these things to the false prophets.   

27. But I say to you, those hearing: Love your enemies, do good to those hating you,

28. bless those cursing you and pray for those insulting you.

29. To those striking you on the cheek, turn the other also. And from those taking your garment, do not keep back the tunic also.

30. And to everyone asking you, give. And do not ask back from those taking your things.

31. And according as you desire that men should do to you, you also do the same to them.

32. And if you love those who love you, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners love those who love them.

33. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks is there to you? For even the sinners do the same.

34. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks is there to you? For the sinners lend to sinners so that they may receive the same.

35. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return ; and your reward will be much; and you will be sons of the Most High, for He is kind to the unthankful and evil ones.

36. Therefore, be merciful, even as your Father also is merciful.   

37. Judge not, and in no way be judged. Do not condemn, and in no way you will be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

38. Give, and good measure will be given to you, pressed down and shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For the same measure which you measure, it will be measured back to you.

39. And He spoke a parable to them: A blind one is not able to guide a blind one. Will they not both fall into the ditch?

40. A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who has been perfected will be like his teacher.

41. But why do you look on the twig in your brother's eye, but do not consider the log in your own eye?

42. Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the twig in your eye, not yourself seeing the log in your eye? Hypocrite! First take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the twig in your brother's eye.

43. For there is not a good tree that produces bad fruit, nor a bad tree that produces good fruit.

44. For each tree is known from its own fruit. For they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.

45. The good man brings forth good out of the good treasure of his heart. And the evil man brings forth evil out of the evil treasure of his heart, for his mouth speaks out of the abundance of his heart.

46. And why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?

47. Everyone coming to Me and hearing My words, and doing them, I will show you to whom he is like:

48. He is like a man building a house, who dug and deepened, and laid a foundation on the rock. And a flood having occurred, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it, for it had been founded on the rock.

49. But he who heard and did not perform, he is like a man having built his house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and it immediately fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  

## Luke 7

1. And when He had completed all His words in the ears of the people, He went into Capernaum.

2. And a certain slave of a centurion, one dear to him, having illness, was about to expire.

3. And hearing about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, asking Him that He might come to restore his slave.

4. And coming to Jesus, they earnestly begged Him, saying, He to whom You give this is worthy.

5. For he loves our nation, and he built the synagogue for us.

6. And Jesus went with them. But He being yet not far away from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble, for I am not worthy that You come under my roof.

7. For this reason I did not count myself worthy to come to You. But say in a word, and let my servant be cured.

8. For I also am a man having been set under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to this one, Go! And he goes. And to another, Come! And he comes. And to my slave, Do this! And he does it .

9. And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I did not find such faith in Israel.

10. And those sent, returning to the house, found the sick slave well.   

11. And it happened on the next day, He went into a city being called Nain. And many of His disciples went with Him; also a great crowd.

12. And as He drew near to the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being borne, an only son born to his mother; and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.

13. And seeing her, the Lord felt pity over her and said to her, Stop weeping.

14. And coming up, He touched the coffin; and those carrying it stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!

15. And the dead one sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.

16. And fear took hold of all; and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.

17. And this word about Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.

18. And His disciples reported to John about all these things.   

19. And having called near a certain two of his disciples, John sent to Jesus, saying, Are You the One coming? Or should we expect another?

20. And having come to Him, the men said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the One coming, or should we expect another?

21. And in the same hour He healed many from diseases and plagues and evil spirits. And He gave to many blind ones ability to see.

22. And answering, Jesus said to them, Going, report to John what you saw and heard: "Blind ones see again;" "lame ones walk about;" "lepers are being cleansed; "deaf ones hear;" dead ones are raised; poor ones are given the gospel.  Isa. 35:5, 6; 61:1

23. And blessed is he who is not offended in Me.

24. And John's messengers going away, He began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed being shaken by the wind?

25. But what did you go out to see? A man who had been dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in king's palaces.

26. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, even more than a prophet.

27. This is he about whom it has been written: "Behold, I send My messenger" before Your face, who "will prepare Your way before You." Mal. 3:1

28. For I say to you, Among those born of a woman, no prophet is greater than John the Baptist. But the least one in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.

29. And all the people and the tax collectors hearing, they justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and the lawyers set aside God's counsel as to themselves, not being baptized by him.

31. And the Lord said, Then to what shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We piped to you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not weep.

33. For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.

34. The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.

35. But wisdom was justified from all her children.   

36. And a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him that He eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.

37. And, behold, a woman who was a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, taking an alabaster vial of ointment,

38. and standing at His feet, weeping behind Him , she began to wash His feet with tears. And she was wiping with the hairs of her head. And she ardently kissed His feet and was anointing them with the ointment.

39. But seeing, the Pharisee who invited Him spoke within himself, saying, This one, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what the woman who touches him is ; for she is a sinner.

40. And answering, Jesus said to the man, Simon, I have a thing to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say it .

41. There were two debtors to a certain creditor: the one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.

42. But they not having a thing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do you say will love him most?

43. And answering, Simon said, I suppose the one to whom he freely forgave the most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.

44. And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give water for My feet, but she washed My feet with tears and wiped off with the hairs of her head.

45. You gave Me no kiss, but she from when I entered did not stop fervently kissing My feet.

46. You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with ointment.

47. For this reason I say to you, her many sins are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.

48. And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.

49. And those reclining with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?

50. But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.  

## Luke 8

1. And it happened afterwards, even He traveled in every city and village, preaching and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with Him;

2. also certain women who were healed from evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, having been called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,

3. and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to Him of their possessions.   

4. And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke through a parable:

5. The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the heaven ate it.

6. And other fell on the rock; and sprouting, it dried up because of not having moisture.

7. And other fell in the midst of the thorns; and springing up with the thorns, they choked it.

8. And other fell on the good ground; and springing up, it produced fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, He cried out, The one having ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And His disciples questioned Him, saying, What might this parable be?

10. And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, that seeing they might not see, and hearing, they might not understand. Isa. 6:9

11. And this is the parable: The seed is the Word of God.

12. And those by the roadside are those who hear, then the Devil comes and takes away the Word from their heart, lest believing they may be saved.

13. And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a time, and in time of trial draw back.

14. And those falling in the thorns, these are those hearing, but under cares and riches and pleasures of life, having moved along, they are choked, and do not bear to maturity.

15. And those in the good ground, these are the ones who in a right and good heart, hearing the Word, they hold it and bear fruit in patience.

16. But no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel, or puts it underneath a couch, but sets it on a lampstand, that those coming in may see the light.

17. For nothing is hidden which will not be revealed, nor secret which will not be known and come to be revealed.

18. Then observe how you hear; for whoever may have, it will be given to him; and whoever may not have, even what he seems to have will be taken from him.

19. And His mother and His brothers came to Him, and were not able to come up with Him through the crowd.

20. And it was told to Him, saying Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wishing to see You.

21. And answering, He said to them, My mother and My brothers are these: the ones hearing the Word of God, and doing it.   

22. And it happened on one of the days that He and His disciples entered into a boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.

23. And as they sailed He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake, and they were being filled and were in danger.

24. And coming up they awakened Him, saying, Master! Master! We are perishing! And being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the roughness of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One, that He commands even the wind and the water, and they obey Him?

26. And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.

27. And He going out onto the land, a certain man out of the city met Him, who had demons from a long time. (And he put no garment on; and he did not stay in a house, but among the tombs).

28. And seeing Jesus, and crying out, he fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, What to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beg You, do not torment me.

29. For He charged the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was bound with chains and fetters, being guarded. And tearing apart the bonds, he was driven by the demons into the deserted places .

30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion (because many demons entered into him).

31. And they begged Him that He not order them to go away into the abyss.

32. And there was a herd of many pigs feeding there in the mount. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into those. And He allowed them.

33. And coming out from the man, the demons entered into the pigs; and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and was choked.

34. And seeing the thing, those feeding the pigs fled. And leaving, they reported to the city and to the farms.

35. And they went out to see the thing happening, and came to Jesus. And they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and of sound mind. And they were afraid.

36. And those seeing also related to them how the demon-possessed one was healed.

37. And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear. And they asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.

38. And the man from whom the demons had gone out begged Him, desiring to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. Go back to your house and tell what God did to you. And he went away proclaiming through all the city what things Jesus did to him.   

40. And it happened as Jesus returned, the crowd gladly received Him, for they were all waiting for Him.

41. And, behold, a man named Jairus came, and this one was a synagogue ruler. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged Him to come into his house,

42. because an only daughter was born to him, about twelve years old ; and she was dying. And in His going, the crowd pressed on Him.

43. And a woman being in a flow of blood from twelve years, who had spent her whole living on physicians, and could not be cured by anyone,

44. coming up behind she touched the border of His garment. And instantly the flow of her blood stopped.

45. And Jesus said, Who was touching Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowds press on You and jostle. And do You say, Who was touching Me?

46. But Jesus said, Someone touched Me, for I knew power had gone out from Me.

47. And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling and kneeled down before Him and told Him before all the people for what reason she touched Him, and how she was instantly cured.

48. And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has healed you. Go in peace.

49. As He was yet speaking, someone came from the synagogue ruler, saying to him, Your daughter has expired. Do not trouble the Teacher.

50. But hearing, Jesus answered him, saying, Do not fear; only believe and she will be healed.

51. And coming into the house, He did not allow anyone to enter, except Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the child.

52. And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Stop weeping. She has not died, but is sleeping.

53. And they scoffed at Him, knowing that she died.

54. But putting all outside, and taking hold of her hand, He called out, saying, Child, rise up!

55. And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. And He ordered something to eat be given to her.

56. And her parents were amazed. But He charged them to tell no one of that which occurred.  

## Luke 9

1. And having called together His twelve disciples, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases.

2. And He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to heal the ones being sick.

3. And He said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staffs, nor moneybags, nor bread, nor silver, nor each to have two tunics.

4. And into whatever house you enter, remain there, and go out from there.

5. And as many as may not receive you, going out from that city even shake off the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.

6. And going out, they passed through the villages, having announced the gospel, and healing everywhere.

7. And Herod the tetrarch heard all the things happening by Him, and was puzzled, because of the saying by some that John had been raised from the dead,

8. and by some that Elijah had appeared. And others said , A prophet of the ancients rose again.

9. And Herod said, I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see Him.   

10. And returning, the apostles told Him what things they did. And taking them He went out privately to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.

11. But knowing this , the crowds followed Him. And having received them, He spoke to them about the kingdom of God. And He cured those having need of healing.

12. But the day began to wane. And coming up the Twelve said to Him, Let the crowd go that going to the surrounding villages and farms they may lodge and find food supplies, because here we are in a deserted place.

13. But He said to them, You give them to eat. But they said, There are not to us more than five loaves and two fish, unless going we buy foods for all this people.

14. For they were about five thousand men. But He said to His disciples, Make them recline in groups, by fifties.

15. And they did so, and made all recline.

16. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to Heaven, He blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.

17. And they ate and were all satisfied. And twelve hand baskets of fragments of that left over to them were taken up.   

18. And it happened as He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him. And He questioned them, saying, Whom do the crowds say Me to be?

19. And answering, they said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others that some prophet of the ancients has risen again.

20. And He said to them, But whom do you say Me to be? And answering, Peter said, The Christ of God.

21. And strictly warning them, He ordered no one to tell this,

22. saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.

23. And He said to all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily. And let him follow Me.

24. For whoever desires to save his life, he will lose it. But whoever loses his life for My sake, this one will save it.

25. For what is a man profited gaining the whole world but destroying himself or suffering loss?

26. For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of man will be ashamed of that one when He comes in His glory, and that of the Father, and of the holy angels.

27. But truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who in no way shall taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.   

28. And about eight days after these sayings, it happened: also taking Peter and John and James, He went into the mountain to pray.

29. And in His praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing was dazzling white.

30. And, behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.

31. Appearing in glory, they spoke of His exodus, which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and those with him were pressed down with sleep. But fully awakening, they saw His glory, and the two men standing with Him.

33. And it happened in their parting from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. And, Let us make three tents, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said.

34. And he saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they feared as those entered into the cloud.

35. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved; hear Him! Psa. 2:7; Isa. 42:1; Deut. 18:15

36. And as the voice occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they were quiet. And they reported to no one in those days, nothing which they had seen.   

37. And it happened on the next day, they coming down from the mountain, a huge crowd met Him.

38. And, behold, a man called aloud from the crowd, saying, Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he is my only born.

39. And, behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it throws him into convulsions, with foaming. And it departs from him with pain, bruising him.

40. And I begged Your disciples, that they cast it out. And they were not able.

41. And answering, Jesus said, O unbelieving and having been perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.

42. But as he was yet coming up, the demon tore him and violently convulsed him . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.   

43. And all were astonished at the majesty of God. And as all were marveling at all things which He did, Jesus said to His disciples,

44. You lay into your ears these sayings, for the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.

45. But they did not understand this saying, and it was veiled from them so that they might not perceive it. And they feared to ask Him about this word.

46. But an argument came in among them, who might be the greater of them.

47. And seeing the argument of their heart, taking a child, Jesus stood it beside Himself,

48. and said to them, Whoever receives this child on My name receives Me. And whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For the one being least among you all, this one shall be great.

49. And answering, John said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons on Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.

50. And Jesus said to them, Do not forbid, for whoever is not against us is for us.   

51. And it happened in the fulfilling of the days of His taking up, even He set His face to go to Jerusalem.

52. And He sent messengers before His face. And going they went into a village of Samaritans, so as to make ready for Him.

53. And they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.

54. And seeing, His disciples James and John said, Lord, do You desire that we tell fire to come down from Heaven, and to destroy them, even as Elijah did? 2 K. 1:10-12

55. But turning He rebuked them. And He said, You do not know of what spirit you are.

56. For the Son of man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save. And they went to another village.   

57. And it happened as they were going in the way, one said to Him, I will follow You everywhere You may go, Lord.

58. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven nests, but the Son of man has nowhere He may lay His head.

59. And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, allow me to go first to bury my father.

60. But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their dead, but going out, you announce the kingdom of God.

61. And also another said, I will follow You, Lord, but first allow me to take leave of those in my house.

62. But Jesus said to him, No one putting his hand on the plow, and looking at the things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.  

## Luke 10

1. And after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place, even to where He was about to come.

2. Therefore He said to them, Indeed the harvest is much, but the laborers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He send out workers into His harvest.

3. Go! Behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Do not carry a purse, nor a moneybag, nor sandals; and greet no one by the way.

5. And into whatever house you may enter, first say, Peace to this house.

6. And if a son of peace is truly there, your peace shall rest on it; but if not so, it shall return to you.

7. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things shared by them; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not move from house to house.

8. And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things set before you.

9. And heal the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.

10. But into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, going out into its streets, say,

11. Even the dust clinging to us out of your city, we shake off against you! Yet know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near to you!

12. And I say to you that it shall be more bearable for Sodom in that day than for that city!

13. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which have been occurring in you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes!

14. But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in the Judgment than for you.

15. And you, Capernaum, were you not exalted to the heaven? "You will be thrust down to Hades!" Isa. 14:13, 15

16. The one hearing you hears Me, and the one rejecting you also rejects Me, and the one rejecting Me also rejects the One having sent Me.   

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through Your Name.

18. And He said to them, I saw Satan falling out of Heaven as lightning!

19. Behold, I have given you the authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and on all the power of the Enemy, and nothing shall hurt you, not at all

20. But stop rejoicing in this, that the evil spirits submit to you. But rather rejoice that your names are written in Heaven.

21. In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit, and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of Heaven and of earth, that You hid these things from the sophisticated and cunning and revealed them to babes; yes, Father, because so it was pleasing before You.

22. All things were delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father; and who is the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son may desire to reveal Him .

23. And having turned to the disciples alone, He said, Blessed are the eyes seeing what you see.

24. For I say to you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.   

25. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, testing Him and saying, Teacher, What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

26. And He said to him, What has been written in the Law? How do you read it ?

27. And answering, he said, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength," and with all your mind, and "your neighbor as yourself." Deut. 6:5; Lev. 19:18

28. And He said to him, You have answered rightly; do this, and you shall live.

29. But desiring to justify himself, he said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30. And taking it up, Jesus said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell in with robbers, who both stripping him and laying on blows, went away, leaving him being half dead.

31. But by a coincidence, a certain priest was going on that road; and seeing him, he passed on the opposite side .

32. And in the same way, a Levite, also being at the place, coming and seeing him , he passed on the opposite side .

33. But a certain traveling Samaritan came upon him, and seeing him, he was filled with pity.

34. And coming near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. And putting him on his own animal, he brought him to an inn and cared for him.

35. And going forth on the morrow, taking out two denarii, he gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Care for him, and whatever more you spend, on my return I will repay to you.

36. Who, then, of these three seems to you to have become a neighbor to the one having fallen among the robbers?

37. And he said, The one doing the deed of mercy with him. Then Jesus said to him, Go, and you do likewise.   

38. And as they went on, it happened, He also entered into a certain village. And a certain woman, Martha by name, received Him into her house.

39. And she had a sister being called Mary, who also was sitting alongside, at the feet of Jesus, and heard His word.

40. But Martha was distracted about much serving. And coming on she said, Lord, Is it not a care to You that my sister left me alone to serve? Then tell her that she should help me.

41. But answering Jesus said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,

42. But there is need of only one; and Mary chose the good part, which shall not be taken from her.  

## Luke 11

1. And it happened as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. And He said to them: When you pray, say, Our Father who is in Heaven, hallowed be Your name, let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done on earth as it also is in Heaven.

3. Give us our needed bread day by day;

4. and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

5. And He said to them, Who of you shall have a friend, and will come to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves.

6.  For a friend of mine arrived to me from a journey, and I do not have what I may set before him.

7. And answering from within that one may say, Do not cause me troubles. The door has already been shut, and my children are in bed with me. I cannot rise up to give to you.

8. I say to you, even if rising up he will not give to him because he is a friend, yet because of his shameless insisting, rising up he will give him as many as he needs.

9. And I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

10. For everyone asking receives, and the one seeking finds, and to the one knocking, it will be opened.

11. And what father of you, if the son asks for bread, will he give him a stone? And if a fish, will he give him a snake instead of a fish?

12. And if he should ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. Then if you being evil know to give good gifts to your children, how much more the Father out of Heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those asking Him.   

14. And He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it happened as the demon was going out, the dumb one spoke. And the crowds marveled.

15. But some of them said, He casts out the demons by Beelzebub the chief of the demons.

16. And tempting Him , others were seeking a sign from Heaven from Him.

17. But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to ruin, and a house against a house falls.

18. And also if Satan is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out the demons by Beelzebub.

19. And if I cast out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast out? Because of this they shall be your judges.

20. But if I cast out the demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

21. When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace.

22. But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.

23. The one not being with Me is against Me. And the one not gathering with me scatters.

24. When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest. And not finding, he says, I will return to my house from where I came out.

25. And coming, he finds it swept and decorated.

26. Then he goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entering he dwells there. And the last things of that man become worse than the first.   

27. And as He spoke these things, it happened that a certain woman lifted up her voice out of the crowd and said to Him, Blessed is the womb having borne You and the breasts which You sucked.

28. But He said, No; rather, blessed are those hearing the Word of God, and keeping it.   

29. But the crowds pressing on Him , He began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of man will be to this generation.

31.  The queen of the south will be raised in the Judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And, behold, a Greater-than-Solomon is here.

32. Men, Ninevites will rise up in the Judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And, behold, a Greater-than-Jonah is here.

33. But no one having lit a lamp places it in secret, nor under the grain-measure, but on the lampstand, that the ones entering may see the light.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye. Then when your eye is sound, also all your body is light. But when it is evil, also your body is dark.

35. Watch, then, that the light in you is not darkness.

36. If, then, your whole body is light, not having any part dark, all will be light, as when the lamp enlightens you with its shining.   

37. And as He was speaking, a certain Pharisee asked Him that He would dine with him. And going in, He reclined.

38. But watching, the Pharisee marveled that He did not first wash before the dinner.

39. But the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inside is full of robbery and evil.

40. Fools! Did not He who made the outside also make the inside?

41. But give alms of the things which are within, and behold, all things are clean to you.

42. But woe to you, Pharisees, for you pay tithes of the mint, and the rue, and every plant, and pass by the judgment and the love of God. It was right to do these things, but not to leave aside those.

43. Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the chief seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.

44. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites! For you are as the unseen tombs, and the men walking above do not know.

45. And answering, one of the lawyers said to Him, Teacher, saying these things you also insult us.

46. And He said, Woe to you also, lawyers! Because you burden men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe to you! Because you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. So you bear witness and consent to the works of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.

49. And because of this, the wisdom of God said, I will send prophets and apostles to them, and they will kill and drive out some of them,

50. that the blood of all the prophets which has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,

51. from the blood of Abel until the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the House. Yea, I say to you, it will be required from this generation.

52. Woe to you, lawyers! Because you took the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you kept out the ones entering.

53. And as He was saying these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw Him out concerning many things,

54. lying in ambush for Him, and seeking to catch something out of His mouth that they might accuse Him.  

## Luke 12

1. At which time the myriads of the crowd being gathered together, so as to trample on one another, He began to say to His disciples first, Take heed to yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. But there is nothing which has been completely concealed which will not be uncovered, nor hidden which will not be known.

3. For this reason, whatever you said in the darkness will be heard in the light; and whatever you spoke in the ear in the secret rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.

4. But I say to you, My friends, stop being afraid of the ones killing the body, and after these things not having anything more they can do.

5. But I will warn you whom you should fear; fear the ones who after the killing have authority to cast into Hell; yea, I say to you, fear that One!

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them has been forgotten before God.

7. But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered. Then stop being afraid; you differ from many sparrows.

8. But I say to you, everyone who may confess Me before men, the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.

9. But he that denies me before man shall be denied before the angels of God.

10. And everyone who shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven Him; but the ones blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.

11. But when they bring you in before synagogues and rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you shall reply, or what you should say;

12. for the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.   

13. And one from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

14. But He said to him, Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider over you?

15. And He said to them, Beware, and keep back from covetousness; for one's life is not in the abundance of the things which are his.

16. And He spoke a parable to them, saying, A certain rich man produced well from the land.

17. And he reasoned within himself, saying, What may I do, for I have nowhere I may gather my fruits?

18. And he said, I will do this; I will tear down my barns and I will build larger; and I will gather there all my produce and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take rest, eat, drink, and be glad.

20. But God said to him, Fool! This night they demand your soul from you; and that which you prepared, to whom will it be?

21. So is he treasuring up for himself, and not being rich toward God.   

22. And He said to His disciples, Because of this I say to you, do not be anxious as to your life, what you should eat; nor as to the body, what you should put on.

23. The life is more than the food and the body than the clothing.

24. Consider the ravens, for they do not sow, nor do they reap; to which there is no storehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much rather you differ from the birds!

25. And who of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit to his stature?

26. Then if you are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not labor, nor do they spin, but I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these.

28. But if God so dresses the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much rather you, little-faiths?

29. And you, do not seek what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, and stop being in anxiety.

30. For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need these things.

31. But seek the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you.

32. Stop being afraid, little flock, because your Father was pleased to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell your possessions and give alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, an unfailing treasure in Heaven, where a thief cannot come near, nor moth can corrupt.

34. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

35. Let your loins be girded about, and the lamps burning,

36. and you be like men awaiting their Lord when he returns from the feasts, so that he coming and knocking, they will at once open to him.

37. Blessed are those slaves whom the Lord will find watching when he comes. Truly I say to you that he will gird himself and will make them recline, and coming up he will serve them.

38. And if he comes in the second watch, or he comes in the third watch, and finds it so, blessed are those slaves.

39. But know this, that if the house-master had known the hour the thief is coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.

40. And you, then, be ready; for in the hour you think not, the Son of man comes.   

41. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You speak this parable to us, or also to all?

42. And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward whom the lord will set over his house servants, to give the portion of food in season?

43. Blessed is that slave when his Lord comes and will find him so doing.

44. Truly I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.

45. But if that slave should say in his heart, My lord delays to come, and should begin to beat the men servants and the female servants, and to eat and to drink and be drunk,

46. the lord of that slave will come in the day in which he does not expect, and in an hour which he does not know. And he will cut him apart and will put his portion with the unbelievers.

47. But that slave knowing the will of his Lord, and not preparing, nor doing according to His will, will be beaten with many stripes .

48. But he not knowing, and doing things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few. And everyone given much, much will be demanded from him. And to whom much was deposited, more exceedingly they will ask of him.

49. I came to hurl fire into the earth, and what will I if it already has been lit?

50. But I have a baptism to be immersed in, and how am I pressed until it is done!

51. Do you think that I came to give peace in the earth? No, I say to you, but rather division.

52. For from now on five in one house will have been divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. Father will be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, "and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law." Mic. 7:6   

54. And He also said to the crowd, When you see the cloud rising up from the west, you immediately say, A storm is coming; and it happens so.

55. And when a south wind is blowing, you say, There will be heat; and it occurs.

56. Hypocrites! You know to discern the face of the earth and of the heaven, but how is it you do not discern this time?

57. And why do you not judge what is right even of yourselves?

58. For as you go with your adversary to a judge, give pains in the way to be set free from him, that he not drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

59. I say to you, in no way may you leave there until you pay even the last lepton.  

## Luke 13

1. And some were present at the same time reporting to Him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices.

2. And answering, Jesus said to them, Do you think that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?

3. No, I say to you; but if you do not repent, you will all perish in the same way.

4. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, do you think that these were sinners beyond all men who lived in Jerusalem?

5. No, I say to you; but if you do not repent, you will all perish in the same way.   

6. And He spoke this parable: A certain one had planted a fig tree in his vineyard. And he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any .

7. And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, three years I come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down, and why does it waste the ground?

8. And the vinedresser said to him, Sir, leave it also this year until I shall dig around it and throw manure;

9. and see if it indeed makes fruit. But if not, in the future you may cut it down.   

10. And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on one of the sabbaths.

11. And, behold, there was a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent together and was not able to be completely erect.

12. And seeing her, Jesus called her near and said to her, Woman, you have been freed from your infirmity.

13. And He laid hands on her. And instantly she was made erect and glorified God.

14. But answering, being angry that Jesus healed on the sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the crowd, There are six days in which it is right to work. Therefore, coming in these, be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

15. Then the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrite! Each one of you on the sabbath, does he not untie his ox or ass from the manger, and leading it away, give it drink?

16. And this one being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, eighteen years, ought she not to be freed from this bond on the sabbath day?

17. And on His saying these things, all who were opposed to Him were ashamed. And all the crowd rejoiced over all the glorious things taking place by Him.   

18. And He said, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard which a man having taken threw into his garden. And it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the heaven perched in its branches.

20. And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which taking, a woman hid in three measures of meal until all was leavened.

22. And He went through by cities and villages, teaching and making progress toward Jerusalem.   

23. And one said to Him, Lord, are the ones being saved few? But He said to them,

24. Labor to enter in through the narrow gate, for I say to you that many will seek to enter in and will not have strength.

25. From the time the Master of the house shall have risen up, and He shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. And answering, He will say to you, I do not know you. From where are you?

26. Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.

27. And He will say, I tell you I do not know you, from where you are. "Stand back from Me all workers of unrighteousness!" Psa. 6:8

28. There will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrust outside.

29. And they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline in the kingdom of God.

30. And, behold, there are last ones who will be first, and there are first ones who will be last.   

31. In the same day, certain Pharisees came saying to Him, Go out and go on from here, for Herod desires to kill you.

32. And He said to them, Going, say to that fox, Behold, today and tomorrow I cast out demons and I complete cures, and the third day I am perfected.

33. But today and tomorrow and on the following day I must travel on. For it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem.

34. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! The one killing the prophets, and stoning those having been sent to her, how often I desired to gather your children in the way a hen gathers her brood under the wings, and you did not desire  it .

35. Behold, "your house is left" to you "desolate". Jer. 22:5 And truly I say to you, You shall not at all see Me until it come when you say, "Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord." Psa. 118:26  

## Luke 14

1. And it occurred, on His going into a house of one of the Pharisee leaders on a sabbath to eat bread, even they were closely observing Him.

2. And behold, a certain man was dropsical before Him.

3. And answering, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, asking whether it is lawful to heal on the sabbath.

4. And they were silent. And taking the man , He cured him and let him go.

5. And answering to them He said, Whose ass or ox of yours shall fall into a pit, and he will not at once pull it up on the sabbath day?

6. And they were not able to reply to Him against these things.   

7. And He spoke a parable to those who had been invited, noting how they were choosing out the chief seats, saying to them,

8. When you are invited by anyone to wedding feasts, do not recline at the chief seat lest one more honorable than you be invited by him,

9. and coming, he who invited you will say to you, Give this one place. And then you begin with shame to take the last place.

10. But when you are invited, going in, recline at the last place, so that when he who has invited you may come, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then glory will be to you before those reclining with you.

11. For everyone exalting himself will be humbled, and the one humbling himself will be exalted.

12. And He also said to him who had invited Him, When you make a dinner or supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also should invite you in return, and it become a repayment to you.

13. But when you make a banquet, call the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;

14. and then you will be blessed, for they have nothing to repay you. For it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the just.   

15. And one of those reclining with Him , hearing these things, he said to Him, Blessed are those eating bread in the kingdom of God.

16. But He said to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many.

17. And he sent his slave at the supper hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for now all is ready.

18. And all with one mind began to beg off. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I have need to go out and see it; I ask you, have me excused.

19. And another said, I bought five yoke of oxen and I am going to try them out; I ask you, have me excused.

20. And another said, I married a wife, and for this reason I am not able to come.

21. And having come up that slave reported these things to his lord. Then being angry, the housemaster said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and maimed and lame and blind ones.

22. And the slave said, Sir, it has been done as you ordered, and still there is room.

23. And the lord said to the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you that not one of those men who had been invited shall taste of my supper.   

25. And great crowds came together to Him. And turning, He said to them,

26. If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers and sisters, and besides, even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.

27. And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me, he cannot be My disciple.

28. For who of you desiring to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has the things to finish;

29. that having laid a foundation, and not having strength to finish, all those seeing begin to mock him,

30. saying, This man began to build, and did not have strength to finish.

31. Or what king going to attack another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet those coming upon him with twenty thousands?

32. But if not, he being still far off, sending a delegation, he asks the things for peace.

33. So then every one of you who does not abandon all his possessions is not able to be My disciple.

34. The salt is good, but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?

35. It is not fit for soil nor for fertilizer; they throw it out. The one having ears to hear, let him hear.  

## Luke 15

1. And all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to Him, to hear Him.

2. And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This one receives sinners and eats with them.

3. And He spoke to them this parable, saying,

4. What man of you having a hundred sheep, and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety nine in the deserted place and go after the lost one until he finds it?

5. And finding it , he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And coming to the house, he calls together the friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that had been lost.

7. I say to you that so is joy in Heaven over one sinner repenting, than over ninety nine righteous ones who have no need of repentance.

8. Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma does not light a lamp and sweep the house, and look carefully until she finds it?

9. And finding it , she calls together the friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I lost.

10. I say to you, so there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner repenting.   

11. And He said, A certain man had two sons.

12. And the younger of them said to the father, Father give me that part of the property falling to me . And he divided the living to them.

13. And not many days after, gathering up all things, the younger son went away to a distant country. And there he wasted his property, living dissolutely.

14. But having spent all his things, a severe famine came throughout that country, and he began to be in need.

15. And going, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.

16. And he longed to fill his stomach from the husks which the pigs ate, but no one gave to him.

17. But coming to himself he said, How many servants of my father have plenty of loaves, and I am perishing with famine.

18. Rising up, I will go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I sinned against Heaven and before you,

19. and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.

20. And rising up, he came to his father. But he yet being far away, his father saw him and was moved with pity. And running, he fell on his neck and fervently kissed him.

21. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you, and no longer am I worthy to be called your son.

22. But the father said to his slaves, Bring out the best robe and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet.

23. And bring the fattened calf, slaughter and let us eat and be merry;

24. for this son of mine was dead, and lived again, and was lost, and was found. And they began to be merry.

25. But the older son was in a field. And having come, as he drew near to the house, he heard music and dances.

26. And having called one of the children, he inquired what this may be.

27. And he said to him, Your brother came, and your father killed the fattened calf, because he received him back in health.

28. But he was angry and did not desire to go in. Then coming out, his father begged him.

29. But answering, he said to the father, Behold, so many years I serve you, and never have I transgressed a command of you. And you never gave a goat to me , so that I might be merry with my friends.

30. But when this son of yours came, the one devouring your living with harlots, you killed the fattened calf for him.

31. But he said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all of my things are yours.

32. But to be merry and to rejoice was right, for this brother of yours was dead, and lived again; and being lost, also he was found.  

## Luke 16

1. And He also said to His disciples, A certain man was rich; and he had a steward, and this one was accused to him as wasting his goods.

2. And calling him, he said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.

3. And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, for my Lord is taking away the stewardship from me? I am not able to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what I will do, that when I am removed from the stewardship, they will receive me into their houses.

5. And calling to him each one of the debtors of his lord, he said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?

6. And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take your statements and sitting quickly write fifty.

7. Then he said to another, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, a hundred cors of wheat. And he said to him, Take your statement and write eighty.

8. And the lord praised the unrighteous steward, because he acted prudently. For the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of light themselves are in their generation.

9. And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends by the unrighteous mammon, that when it fails they may take you into the eternal dwellings.

10. He faithful in the least is also faithful in much. And he unrighteous in the least is also unrighteous in much.

11. Then if you were not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust the true to you?

12. And if you were not faithful in that of another, who will give to you that which is yours?

13. No servant is able to serve two lords; for either he will hate the one, and he will love the other; or he will cling to one, and he will despise the other. You are unable to serve God and mammon.

14. And being lovers of money, the Pharisees also heard all these things; and they derided Him.

15. And He said to them, You are those justifying yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for the thing highly prized among men is a hateful thing before God.

16. The Law and the Prophets were until John; from then the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is pressing into it.

17. But it is easier for the heaven and the earth to pass away than one tittle of the law to fail.

18. Everyone putting away his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery. And everyone marrying her who has been put away from a husband commits adultery.   

19. And there was a certain rich man; and he was accustomed to don a purple robe and fine linen, making merry in luxury day by day.

20. And there was a certain poor one named Lazarus who had been laid at his porch, being plagued by sores,

21. and longing to be filled from the crumbs that were falling from the table of the rich one. But coming, even the dogs licked his sores.

22. And it happened, the poor one died and was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham. And the rich one also died and was buried.

23. And being in torments in Hell, lifting up his eyes, he sees Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosoms.

24. And calling he said, Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Child, remember that you fully received your good things in your lifetime, and Lazarus likewise the bad things. But now he is comforted, and you are suffering.

26. And besides all these things, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those desiring to pass from here to you are not able, nor can they pass from there to us.

27. And he said, Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father's house;

28. (for I have five brothers, so that he may witness to them, that they not also come to this place of torment).

29. Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them.

30. But he said, No, father Abraham, but if one should go from the dead to them, they will repent.

31. And he said to him, If they will not hear Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if one from the dead should rise.  

## Luke 17

1. And He said to the disciples, It is impossible that the offenses should not come, but woe to him by whom they come!

2. It is profitable for him if a millstone turned by an ass is put around his neck, and he be thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

3. Take heed to yourselves. And if your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.

4. And if seven times of the day he sins against you, and seven times of the day turns to you saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.

6. But the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard, you may say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up and be planted in the sea! And it would obey you.

7. But which of you having a slave plowing or feeding will say at once to him coming out of the field, Come, recline?

8. But will he not say to him, Prepare something what I may eat, and having girded yourself, serve me until I eat and drink, and after these things you shall eat and drink?

9.  Does he have thanks to that slave because he did the things commanded of him? I think not.

10. So also when you have done all things commanded you, you say, We are unprofitable slaves, for we have done what we ought to do.   

11. And it happened in His going to Jerusalem even He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And He entering into a certain village, ten leprous men met Him, who stood afar off.

13. And they lifted their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, pity us.

14. And seeing them , He said to them, Going, show yourselves to the priests. And it happened in their going they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, seeing that he was cured, returned glorifying God with a loud voice.

16. And he fell on his face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.

17. And answering, Jesus said, Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?

18. Were not any found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?

19. And He said to him, Rising up, go! Your faith has cured you.   

20. And being questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God comes, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;

21. nor will they say, Lo, here! Or, Lo, there! For behold the kingdom of God is in your midst.

22. And He said to the disciples, Days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of man, and will not see.

23. And they will say to you, Lo, here! Or, Lo, there! Do not go away, nor follow.

24. For as the lightning which lights up, flashing from the one part under heaven and shines to the other part under heaven, so also will the Son of man be in His day.

25. But first He must suffer many things and be rejected from this generation.

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so also it will be in the days of the Son of man.

27. They were eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage, until the day Noah went into the ark. And the flood came and destroyed all.

28. And likewise, as it was in the days of Lot, they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;

29. but on the day Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from the heaven and destroyed all.

30. Even so it will be in the day the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day, he who will be on the housetop, let him not come down to take his goods from the house. And likewise, he in the field, let him not return to the things behind.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whoever seeks to save his life, he will lose it. And whoever will lose it, he will preserve it.

34. I say to you, In that night two will be on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left.

35. Two will be grinding together; one will be taken and the other will be left.

36. Two will be in the field; the one will be taken and the other will be left.

37. And answering, they said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Where the body is , there the eagles will be gathered together.  

## Luke 18

1. And He also spoke a parable to them to teach it is always right to pray, and not to faint,

2. saying, A certain judge was in a certain city, not fearing God and not respecting man.

3. And a widow was in that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me from my adversary.

4. And for a time he would not. But after these things he said to himself, Even if I do not fear God, and do not respect man,

5. yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, that not coming to the end, she subdue me.

6. And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says;

7. and will God not at all execute the avenging of His elect, those crying to Him day and night, also having been long-suffering over them?

8. I say to you that He will carry out the avenging of them speedily. But the Son of man coming then, will He find faith on the earth?   

9. And He also spoke this parable to some of those relying on themselves, that they are righteous, and despising the rest:

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.

11. The Pharisee was standing, praying these things to himself: God, I thank You that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.

12. I fast twice in the week; I tithe all things, as many as I get.

13. And standing at a distance, the tax collector would not even lift up his eyes to Heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, the sinner!

14. I say to you, this one went down to his house having been justified, rather than that one. For everyone exalting himself will be humbled. And the one humbling himself will be exalted.   

15. And they brought infants to Him also, that He might touch them. But seeing, the disciples rebuked them.

16. But Jesus called them near, saying, Allow the children to come to Me, and do not prevent them. For of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child, not at all will enter into it.   

18. And a certain ruler asked Him saying, Good Teacher, what may I do to inherit eternal life?

19. But Jesus said to him, Why do you say Me to be good? No one is good, except One: God.

20. You know the commandments: "Do not commit adultery," "do not murder," "do not steal," "do not bear false witness," "honor your father and your mother." Ex. 20:12-16

21. And he said, I have kept all these from my youth.

22. And hearing these things, Jesus said to him, Yet one thing is lacking to you: sell all, as much as you have, and give to the poor; and you will have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me.

23. But hearing these things, he became very much grieved, for he was exceedingly rich.

24. And seeing him having become very much grieved, Jesus said, How hardly those having riches shall enter into the kingdom of God!

25. For it is easier for a camel to go in through a needle's eye than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And those hearing said, And who is able to be saved?

27. But He said, The things impossible with men are possible with God.

28. And Peter said, Behold, we left all and followed You.

29. And He said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who shall not receive many times more in this time, and in the age that is coming, everlasting life.   

31. And taking the Twelve, He said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things will be fulfilled which have been written through the prophets to the Son of man.

32. For He will be delivered up to the nations, and will be mocked, and will be insulted, and will be spat upon.

33. And flogging Him , they will kill Him. And on the third day He will rise again.

34. And they did not understand these things, nothing! And this saying had been hidden from them, and they did not know the things being said.   

35. And it happened as He drew near to Jericho, a certain blind one sat by the highway, begging.

36. And a crowd passing through, he asked what this might be.

37. And they reported to him that Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.

38. And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, pity me!

39. And those going before rebuked him, that he be quiet. But he much more cried out, Son of David, pity me!

40. And standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to Him. And he drawing near, He asked him,

41. saying, What do you desire I do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may see again.

42. And Jesus said to him, See again! Your faith has healed you.

43. And instantly he saw again. And he followed Him, glorifying God. And seeing, all the people gave praise to God.  

## Luke 19

1. And going in, He passed through Jericho.

2. And, behold, a man called by name Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.

3. And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He is. And he was not able, because of the crowd, and he was little in stature.

4. And running ahead, he went up onto a sycamore tree, so that he might see Him; for He was going to pass through that way .

5. And as He came to the place, looking up, Jesus saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry, come down, for today I must stay in your house.

6. And hastening, he came down and welcomed Him, rejoicing.

7. And seeing, all murmured, saying, He has gone in to stay with a sinful man.

8. But standing, Zaccheus said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor. And if in anything I accused anyone falsely, I restore it fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, for he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man came to seek and to save the one being lost.   

11. But as they were hearing these things, He spoke, adding a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God was immediately to be revealed.

12. Then He said: A certain wellborn man went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and to return.

13. And calling ten of his slaves, He gave to them ten minas and said to them, Trade until I come.

14. But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not desire this one to reign over us.

15. And it happened as he returned, having received the kingdom, he even said for those slaves to be called to him, those to whom he gave the silver, that he might know what each had gained by trading.

16. And the first came, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.

17. And he said to him, Well done , good slave! Because you were faithful in a least thing, have authority over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has made five minas.

19. And he said to this one also, And you be over five cities.

20. And another came, saying, Lord, behold your mina which I had kept in a handkerchief.

21. For I feared you, because you are an exacting man, taking what you did not lay down, and reaping what you did not sow.

22. But he said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, wicked slave. You knew that I am an exacting man, taking what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.

23. And why did you not give my silver on the bank table? And coming, I might have exacted it with interest.

24. And to those standing by, he said, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.

25. And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.

26. For I say to you, To everyone who has, it will be given. And from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.

27. But these enemies of mine, those not desiring me to reign over them, bring them here and execute them before me.   

28. And saying these things, He went in front, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it happened as He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany toward the Mount called Of Olives, He sent two of the disciples,

30. saying, Go into the village opposite you , in which having entered you will find a colt which has been tied up, on which no one of men ever yet sat. Untying it, bring it .

31. And if anyone asks, Why do you untie it ? You shall say to them, The Lord has need of it.

32. And going, those having been sent found as He told them.

33. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why do you untie the colt?

34. And they said, The Lord has need of it.

35. And they led it to Jesus. And throwing their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it .

36. And as He went, they were spreading their garments in the highway.

37. And as He was already drawing near to the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice concerning all the works of power which they saw,

38. saying, "Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord," the King. Peace in Heaven, and glory in the highest! Psa. 118:26

39. And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.

40. And answering, He said to them, I say to you, If these should be silent, the stones will cry out.   

41. And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,

42. saying, If you had known, even you, even at least in this day of yours, the things for your peace! But now they were hidden from your eyes.

43. For the days will come on you, and your enemies will raise up a rampart to you and will surround you and will keep you in on every side,

44. and will tear you down, and your children in you, and will not leave a stone on a stone, because you did not know the time of your visitation.

45. And entering into the temple, He began to throw out those selling and buying in it,

46. saying to them, It has been written, "My house is a house of prayer," but you made it "a den of robbers." Isa. 56:7; Jer. 7:11

47. And He was teaching day by day in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief men of the people sought to kill Him.

48. And they did not find what they might do; for all the people hung on Him, listening.  

## Luke 20

1. And it happened on one of those days, as He was teaching the people and announcing the gospel in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes came up, along with the elders,

2. and spoke to Him, saying, Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who is it who gave to you this authority?

3. And answering, He said to them, I will also ask you one thing, and you tell me:

4. The baptism of John, was it from Heaven, or from men?

5. And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, he will say, Then why did you not believe him?

6. But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, having been convinced that John was a prophet.

7. And they answered, they did not know from where.

8. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.   

9. And He began to speak this parable to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to vinedressers. And he left the country for long periods of time . Isa. 5:1, 2

10. And in season, he sent a slave to the vinedressers, that they might give him the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers sent him away empty, beating him .

11. And he again sent another slave. But they also sent that one away empty, beating and insulting him .

12. And he again sent a third. But they also threw this one out, wounding him .

13. And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps seeing this one, they will respect him .

14. And seeing him, the vinedressers reasoned with themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours.

15. And throwing him out of the vineyard, they killed him . Therefore, what will the Lord of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and will destroy these vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others. And hearing this, they said, Let it not be!

17. And looking at them He said, What then is this which has been written, " The stone that the builders rejected, this one came to be for the Head of the corner"? Psa. 118:22

18. Everyone falling on that Stone will be broken in pieces but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.

19. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him in the same hour. And they feared the people, for they knew that He told this parable against them.   

20. And watching carefully, they sent spies, pretending themselves to be righteous, in order that they might seize upon a word of His, so as to deliver Him to the power and to the authority of the governor.

21. And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not receive a face, but you teach the way of God with truth.

22. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

23. But perceiving their slyness, He said to them, Why do you tempt Me?

24. Show Me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have? And answering, they said, Caesar's.

25. And He said to them, Then render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.

26. And they were not able to lay hold of His speech before the people. And marveling at His answer, they were silent.   

27. And some of the Sadducees coming up, those speaking against a resurrection, that it was not to be, they questioned Him,

28. saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone's brother dies having a wife, and this one should die childless, that his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother. Deut. 25:5

29. Then there were seven brothers. And having taken a wife, the first died childless.

30. And the second took the wife, and this one died childless.

31. And the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children, and died.

32. And last of all the woman died.

33. Then in the resurrection, of which of them does she become wife? For the seven had her as wife.

34. And answering, Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage.

35. But those counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.

36. For they are not able to die any more; they are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

37. But that the dead are raised, even Moses pointed out at the Bush, when he calls the Lord "the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Ex. 3:6

38. But He is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to Him.   

39. And answering, some of the scribes said, Teacher, you speak well.

40. And they did not dare to question Him any more, not a thing.

41. And He said to them, How do they say the Christ is David's son?

42. Even David himself said in the Book of Psalms, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

43. until I place Your enemies as a footstool of Your feet." LXX-Psa. 109:1; MT-Psa. 110:1

44. Then David calls Him Lord. And how is He his son?

45. And as all the people were listening, He said to His disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes, those desiring to walk about in long robes, and liking greetings in the markets, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief couches in the suppers,

47. who devour the houses of the widows, and under pretense pray long. These will receive a more severe judgment.  

## Luke 21

1. And looking up, He saw the rich ones putting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And He also saw a certain poor widow putting two lepta there.

3. And He said, Truly I say to you this poor widow put in more than all.

4. For all these out of their abundance put into the gifts to God, but she out of her poverty put in all the living which she had.   

5. And as some were speaking about the temple, that it had been adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, He said,

6.  As to these things that you see, days will come in which a stone will not be left on a stone, which will not be thrown down.

7. And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, then when will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?

8. And He said, Watch that you not be led astray. For many will come on My name, saying, I AM! Also, The time has come! Do not go after them.

9. And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be afraid. For these things must first occur, but the end is not at once.

10. Then He said to them, Nation will be lifted up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. Also there will be great earthquakes from place to place, and famines, and plagues. And also there will be terrors and great signs from Heaven.

12. But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you, and will persecute you , delivering you into the synagogues and prisons, being led away before kings and governors on account of My name.

13. But it will return to you for a testimony.

14. Then put into your hearts not to premeditate to make a defense.

15. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you will not be able to withstand or contradict.

16. But you will be betrayed also by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends. And they will put some of you to death.

17. And you will be hated by all because of My name.

18. And a hair of your head shall in no way perish.

19. By your patience you will gain your souls.   

20. And when you see Jerusalem being encircled by armies, then recognize that its destruction has come near.

21. Then let those in Judea flee into the mountains; and those in its midst, let them go out. And those in the open spaces, let them not go into her.

22. For these are days of vengeance when all things that have been written are to be fulfilled.

23. But woe to the pregnant women, and the ones suckling in those days; for great distress will be on the earth and wrath on this people.

24. And they will fall by the mouth of the sword and will be led captive to all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by nations, until the times of the nations are fulfilled.

25. And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars. And on the earth will be anxiety of nations with bewilderment, roaring of sea and of surf,

26. men fainting from fear, and expectation of the things coming on the earth. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

27. And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and much glory. Dan. 7:13

28. But when these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.   

29. And He spoke a parable to them: You see the fig tree and all the trees.

30. Now when they sprout leaves, seeing it , you will know from yourselves that now the summer is near.

31. So also when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.

32. Truly I say to you, In no way will this generation pass away until all these things shall occur.

33. The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words in no way will pass away.

34. But take heed to yourselves that your hearts not be loaded down with headaches, and drinking, and anxieties of life, and that day come suddenly upon you

35. as a snare, for it will come in on all those sitting on the face of all the earth. Isa. 24:17

36. Then be watchful at every time, begging that you be counted worthy to escape all these things which are about to happen, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. And in the days, He was teaching in the temple. And going out in the nights, He lodged in the Mount of Olives.

38. And all the people came early to Him in the temple, to hear Him.  

## Luke 22

1. And the Feast of Unleavened Bread , being called Passover, drew near.

2. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how to destroy Him; for they feared the people.

3. And Satan entered into Judas, the one having been called Iscariot, being of the number of the Twelve.

4. And going, he talked with the chief priests and the commanders as to how he might betray Him.

5. And they exulted, and they agreed to give him silver.

6. And he fully consented and sought opportunity to betray Him to them, away from the crowd.   

7. And the day of the Unleavened Bread came, on which the passover must be killed.

8. And He sent Peter and John, saying, Going, prepare for us the passover, that we may eat.

9. And they said to Him, Where do You desire that we prepare?

10. And He said to them, Behold, you going into the city, you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he goes in.

11. And you will say to the housemaster of that house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?

12. And that one will show you a large upper room which he has spread. Prepare there.

13. And going, they found as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.

14. And when the hour came, He reclined, and the twelve apostles with Him.

15. And He said to them, With desire I desired to eat this passover with you before My suffering.

16. For I say to you that never in any way I will eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And taking a cup, giving thanks, He said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.

18. For I say to you that in no way will I drink from the produce of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.

19. And taking a loaf, giving thanks, He broke, and gave to them, saying, This is My body being given for you. Do this for My remembrance.

20. And in the same way the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.   

21. But behold the hand of My betrayer on the table with Me!

22. And, indeed, the Son of man goes according as was determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!

23. And they began to examine themselves who then it may be of them, the one being about to do this.

24. And there was also a dispute among them, who of them seems to be greater.

25. And He said to them, The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those exercising authority over them are called benefactors.

26. But you be not so, but the greater among you, let him be as the lesser; and the one governing as the one serving.

27. For who is greater, the one serving, or the one reclining? Is it not the one reclining? But I am in your midst as One serving.

28. But you are those continuing with Me in My temptation.

29. And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father appointed to Me,

30. that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold! Satan asked for you, to sift you as wheat;

32. but I entreated concerning you, that your faith might not fail. And when you have turned back, confirm your brothers.

33. And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go both to prison and to death with You.

34. And He said, Peter, I say to you, a cock will not crow today before you will deny knowing Me three times.

35. And He said to them, When I sent you without a purse, or a wallet, or sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.

36. Then He said to them, But now, the one having a purse, let him take it ; likewise also a wallet. And the one not having, let him sell his garment, and let him buy a sword.

37. For I say to you that this that has been written must yet be fulfilled in Me: "And He was numbered with the lawless." Isa. 53:12 For the things concerning Me also have an end.

38. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.   

39. And going out, according to His custom, He went to the Mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him.

40. And having come on the place, He said to them, Pray you will not enter into temptation.

41. And He was withdrawn from them, about a stone's throw. And placing the knees, He prayed,

42. saying, Father, if You will, take away this cup from Me; but let not My will be done, but Your will .

43. And an angel from Heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.

44. And being in an agony, He prayed more intently. And His sweat became as drops of blood falling down onto the earth.

45. And rising up from the prayer, coming to His disciples, He found them sleeping from grief.

46. And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Rising up, pray that you do not enter into temptation.   

47. And as He was yet speaking, behold, a crowd! And the one called Judas, one of the Twelve, came in front of them and drew near to Jesus in order to kiss Him.

48. And Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?

49. And those around Him seeing that about to occur, they said to Him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

51. And answering, Jesus said, Allow it until this. And touching his ear, He healed him.

52. And Jesus said to those coming upon Him, chief priests, and commanders of the temple, and elders, Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?

53. When I was with you day by day in the temple, you did not stretch out your hand on Me. But this is your hour and the authority of the darkness.   

54. And laying hold of Him, they led Him away and led Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.

55. And lighting a fire in the middle of the court, and they sitting down, Peter sat in their midst.

56. And a certain slave woman seeing him sitting near the light, and looking intently at him, she said, And this one was with him.

57. But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.

58. And after a while, another seeing him said, You also are of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And about an hour intervening, a certain other one boldly charged, saying, Truly this one also was with him, for he also is a Galilean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crowed.

61. And turning, the Lord looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He told him, Before a cock would crow, you will deny Me three times.

62. And going outside, Peter wept bitterly.   

63. And the men who were holding Jesus mocked Him, beating Him .

64. And blindfolding Him, they were striking His face and questioning Him, saying, Prophesy, who is the one stinging you?

65. And blaspheming, many other things they said to Him.

66. And when day came, the body of elders of the people, the chief priests and scribes, were gathered. And they led Him away into their sanhedrin, saying,

67. If you are the Christ, tell us. And He said to them, If I tell you, you will in no way believe.

68. And also if I ask, in no way will you answer Me, or let Me go.

69. From now on the Son of man will be sitting at the right of the power of God. Psa. 110:1

70. And they all said, Then are you the Son of God? And He said to them, You say it , because I AM!

71. And they said, Why do we yet have need of witness? For we ourselves heard it from his mouth.  

## Luke 23

1. And rising up, all the multitude of them led Him before Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this one perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be a king, Christ.

3. And Pilate questioned Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering, him, He said, You say it .

4. And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find nothing blameable in this man.

5. But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to here.

6. And hearing Galilee, Pilate asked if the man is a Galilean.

7. And knowing that He is from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod, he also being in Jerusalem in these days.

8. And seeing Jesus, Herod greatly rejoiced, for he was wishing to see Him for a long time, because of hearing many things about Him. And he hoped to see some miracle being brought about by Him.

9. And he questioned Him in many words. But He answered him not a thing.

10. And the chief priests and the scribes stood fiercely accusing Him.

11. And having humiliated Him with his soldiery, and mocking Him by putting around Him luxurious clothing, Herod sent Him back to Pilate.

12. And on that same day, both Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for before they were at enmity between themselves.   

13. And having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. Pilate said to them, You brought this man to me as perverting the people. And, behold, examining him before you, I found nothing blameable in this man regarding that which you charge against him.

15. But neither did Herod, for I sent you up to him; and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done by him.

16. Therefore chastising him, I will release him .

17. And he had to release to them one at the Feast.

18. And they all together shouted, saying, Take this one, and release Barabbas to us

19. ( he who was thrown into prison due to some revolt and murder occurring in the city .)

20. Then Pilate again called out, desiring to release Jesus.

21. But they shouted, saying, Crucify! Crucify him!

22. And a third time he said to them, For what evil did this one do? I found no cause of death in him. Therefore, chastising him, I will release him .

23. But with loud voices they insisted, asking for Him to be crucified. And their voices, and that of the chief priests, prevailed.

24. And Pilate adjudged their request to be done.

25. And he released to them the one thrown into prison due to revolt and murder, whom they asked. But he delivered Jesus to their will.   

26. And as they led Him away, having laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from a field, they put the cross on him, to bear it behind Jesus.

27. And a great multitude of people were following Him, and of women who also were bewailing and lamenting Him.

28. And turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children.

29. For behold, days will come in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not bear, and breasts that did not suckle.

30. "Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! And to the hills, Cover us!" Hosea 10:8

31. For if they do these things in the green tree, what may take place in the dry?   

32. And two others, two criminals, were led with Him to be put to death.

33. And when they came on the place being called Skull, they crucified Him and the criminals there, one on the right, and one on the left.

34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast a lot. Psa. 22:18

35. And the people stood watching. And the rulers with them also scoffed, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this one is the Christ, the elect of God.

36. And coming near, the soldiers also mocked Him and were offering vinegar to Him,

37. and saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.

38. And also an inscription was written over Him, in Greek and Latin and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the hanged criminals blasphemed Him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.

40. But answering, the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, for you are in the same judgment?

41. And we indeed justly, for we receive things worthy of what we did. But this One did nothing wrong.

42. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.   

44. And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.

45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the Holy Place was torn in the middle.

46. And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, "into Your hands I commit My spirit." And saying this, He breathed out the spirit. Psa. 31:5

47. And seeing the thing happening, the centurion glorified God, saying, Truly, this Man was righteous.

48. And all the crowd arriving together at this sight, watching the thing happening, beating their breasts, they returned.

49. And all those known to Him stood at a distance, and the women, those who accompanied Him from Galilee, were seeing these things.   

50. And, behold, a man named Joseph, being a councillor, a good and righteous man.

51. This one was not assenting to their counsel and deed ( he was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews), and who himself was eagerly expecting the kingdom of God,

52. coming near to Pilate, this one asked for the body of Jesus.

53. And taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a quarried tomb, where no one was ever yet laid.

54. And it was Preparation Day, and a sabbath was coming on.

55. And also women were following, who were accompanying Him out of Galilee, who watched the tomb, and how His body was placed.

56. And returning, they prepared spices and ointment. And indeed they rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.  

## Luke 24

1. But on the first of the sabbaths, while still very early, they came on the tomb, carrying spices which they prepared; and some were with them.

2. And they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.

3. And going in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it happened, as they were perplexed about this, even behold, two men in shining clothing stood by them.

5. And they becoming terrified, and bowing their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living with the dead?

6. He is not here, but was raised. Remember how He spoke to you, yet being in Galilee,

7. saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day to rise again.

8. And they remembered His words.

9. And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven, and to all the rest.

10. And they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary mother of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed like foolishness to them, and they did not believe them.

12. But rising up, Peter ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linen lying alone. And he went away wondering to himself at what had happened.   

13. And, behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village being sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem, which was named Emmaus.

14. And they talked to each other about all these things taking place.

15. And it happened, as they talked and reasoned, coming near, Jesus Himself traveled with them.

16. But their eyes were held so as not to recognize Him.

17. And He said to them, What words are these which you exchange with each other while walking, and are sad of face?

18. And answering, one of them whose name was Cleopas, said to Him, Are you only one who resides in Jerusalem and do not know the things happening in it in these days?

19. And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;

20. and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the judgment of death, and crucified Him .

21. But we were hoping that He is the One going to redeem Israel. But then with all these things, this third day comes today since these things happened.

22. And also some of our women astounded us, having been early at the tomb,

23. and not finding His body, they came saying to have seen a vision of angels also, who say Him to be alive.

24. And some of those with us went to the tomb, and found it so , even as the women also said; but they did not see Him.

25. And He said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe on all things which the prophets spoke!

26. Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into His glory?

27. And beginning from Moses, and from all the prophets, He explained to them the things about Himself in all the Scriptures.

28. And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He seemed to be going further.

29. And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And He went in to stay with them.

30. And it happened as He reclined with them, taking the loaf, He blessed, and breaking He gave to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him. And He became invisible from them.

32. And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as He spoke to us in the highway, and as He opened up to us the Scriptures?

33. And rising up in the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem, and they found the Eleven, and those with them, having been gathered,

34. saying, The Lord really was raised and appeared to Simon.

35. And they related the things in the highway, and how He was known to them in the breaking of the loaf.   

36. And as they were telling these things, Jesus Himself stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace to you!

37. But being terrified and filled with fear, they thought they saw a spirit.

38. And He said to them, Why are you troubled? And why do reasonings come up in your hearts.

39. See My hands and My feet, that I am He? Feel Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see Me having.

40. And saying this, He showed them His hands and feet.

41. But yet they not believing from the joy, and marveling, He said to them, Have you any food here?

42. And they handed a broiled part of a fish to Him, and from a honeycomb.

43. And taking these before them, He ate.

44. And He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you yet being with you, that must be fulfilled all the things having been written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning Me.

45. Then He opened up their mind to understand the Scriptures,

46. and said to them, So it is written, and so the Christ must suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day. No OT passage

47. And repentance and remission of sins must be preached on His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

48. And you are witnesses of these things.

49. And, behold, I send forth the promise of My Father on you. But you sit in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.   

50. He led them out as far as to Bethany. And lifting up His hands, He blessed them.

51. And it happened as He blessed them, He withdrew from them and was carried into Heaven.

52. And worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

53. and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
