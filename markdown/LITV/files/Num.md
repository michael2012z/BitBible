2. Command the sons of Israel, and they shall send every leper out of the camp, and everyone with an issue, and everyone defiled by a dead body.

3. You shall send out from male and female. You shall send them to the outside of the camp. And they shall not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.

4. And the sons of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp. As Jehovah spoke to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.

5. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Speak to the sons of Israel, man or woman, when they commit any of the sins of man, by committing a trespass against Jehovah, and that person is guilty:

7. Then they shall confess their sin which they have done. And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add its fifth to it, and shall give it to him against whom he has been guilty.

8. And if a man has no kinsman to whom the guilt may be restored, the guilt which is restored shall be Jehovah's, a priest's, besides the ram of the atonement by which he makes atonement for him.

9. And every heave offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel which they bring to the priest shall be his.

10. And any man's dedicated things shall become his, that which any man gives to the priest becomes his.   

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

12. Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When any man's wife goes astray, and has committed a trespass against him,

13. and a man lies with her with semen, and it has been hidden from her husband's eyes, and is kept hidden, and she is defiled, and there is no other witness against her, and she has not been caught;

14. and a spirit of jealousy has passed over him, and he has become jealous of his wife, and she has been defiled. Or, a spirit of jealousy has passed over him, and he has become jealous of his wife, and she has not become defiled:

15. then the man shall bring his wife in to the priest, and he shall bring in her offering for her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal. He shall not pour oil on it, nor shall he put frankincense on it, for it is a food offering of jealousy, a food offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

16. And the priest shall bring her near, and shall cause her to stand before Jehovah.

17. And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel. And the priest shall take of the dust which is on the tabernacle floor, and shall put it into the water.

18. And the priest shall cause the woman to stand before Jehovah, and shall uncover the woman's head, and shall give into her hand the food offering of memorial; it is a food offering of jealousy; and in the priest's hand shall be the bitter waters which cause the curse.

19. And the priest shall cause her to swear and shall say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to impurity under your husband, be free from these bitter waters which cause the curse.

20. And you, if you have turned aside under your husband, and if you have been defiled, and any man besides your husband has given his semen to you,

21. then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman: Jehovah shall make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh to fall away, and your belly to swell,

22. And these waters which cause the curse shall go into your bowels to cause the belly to swell, and the thigh to fall. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

23. And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall blot them with the bitter waters.

24. And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water which cause the curse. And the water which cause the curse shall enter into her for bitter things.

25. And the priest shall take the food offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the food offering before Jehovah, and shall bring it near to the altar.

26. And the priest shall take a handful of the food offering, its memorial, and shall burn it as incense on the altar. And afterward he shall cause the woman to drink the water.

27. And when he shall cause her to drink the water, then it shall be, if she has been defiled and has committed a trespass against her husband, the water which cause the curse shall go into her for bitter things; and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman shall become a curse in the midst of her people.

28. And if the woman has not been defiled, and is pure, then she shall be clean and shall conceive seed.

29. This is the law of jealousies when a wife turns aside under her husband, and has been defiled;

30. or when a spirit of jealousy passes over a man, and he has become jealous of his wife, then he shall cause the woman to stand before Jehovah, and the priest shall do to her all this law;

31. and the man shall be clean from sin, and the woman shall bear her iniquity.  

## Numbers 6

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them, When a man or woman shall vow the special vow of a Nazarite, to be separated to Jehovah:

3. He shall separate from wine and fermented drink; he shall not drink vinegar of wine or vinegar of fermented drink; he shall not drink any juice of the grapes; and he shall not eat dry or moist grapes.

4. All the days of his separation he shall not eat from all that is made of the vine, from pressed grapes, even to the stem.

5. All the days of the vow of his separation, a razor shall not pass over his head; he shall be holy until all the days are fulfilled which he has separated to Jehovah. He shall allow the locks of the hair of his head to grow long.

6. All the days of his separation to Jehovah he shall not go near a dead person.

7. He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, at their death; because his separation to his God is on his head.

8. All the days of his separation he shall be holy to Jehovah.

9. And of any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day he shall shave it.

14. and he shall offer his offering to Jehovah, one he lamb of the first year, a perfect one, for a burnt offering; and one she lamb, a yearling, a perfect one, for a sin offering; and one ram, a perfect one, for a peace offering;

15. and a basket of unleavened cakes of flour, cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their food offering, and their drink offerings.

16. And the priest shall bring them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.

17. And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offering to Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened cakes. And the priest shall offer its food offering and its drink offering.

18. And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and shall put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.

19. And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder from the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the palms of the Nazarite after he has shaved his separation.

20. And the priest shall wave them, a wave offering before Jehovah. It is holy to the priest, besides the breast of the wave offering, and besides the leg of the heave offering. And afterward the Nazarite shall drink wine.

21. This is the law of the Nazarite who vows his offering to Jehovah for his separation, besides that which his hand may get. According to his vow which he vows, so he shall do by the law of his separation.   

22. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, In this way you shall bless the sons of Israel, saying to them:

24. Jehovah bless you and keep you;

25. Jehovah cause His face to shine on you, and be gracious to you;

26. Jehovah lift up His face to you, and give you peace.

27. So they shall put My name on the sons of Israel, and I Myself will bless them.

5. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.

7. And thus you will do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle water of sin offering on them. And they shall make a razor pass over all their flesh and wash their garments and cleanse themselves.

8. And they shall take a bull, a son of the herd, and its food offering, flour mixed with oil, and a second bull, a son of the herd, you shall take for a sin offering.

17. For every first-born among the sons of Israel among man and among animal, is Mine. I set them apart for Myself in the day I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt.

18. And I take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel.

9. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

12. they shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statutes of the Passover, they shall keep it.

13. But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and has failed to prepare the Passover, even that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not bring the offering of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

14. And if an alien shall reside with you, and desires to keep the Passover to Jehovah; he shall do according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance. You shall have one statute, both for the alien and for the native of the land.

22. Whether two days, or a month, or days, when the cloud tarried over the tabernacle, to remain over it, the sons of Israel remained in camp, and did not pull up. And when it was lifted up, they pulled up stakes .

23. By the mouth of Jehovah they encamped, and by the mouth of Jehovah they pulled up stakes . They kept the charge of Jehovah, by the mouth of Jehovah, by the hand of Moses.  

## Numbers 10

2. Make two trumpets of silver for yourself. You shall make them of hammered work, and they shall be to you for the calling of the congregation, and for causing the camps to pull up stakes .

3. And when they blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

4. And if they blow with one, then the rulers, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall assemble to you.

5. And when you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall then pull up.

6. And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall pull up; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

7. But when the assembly is gathered, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.

8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets. And they shall be to you for a never ending statute throughout your generations.

9. And when you go into battle in your land against the foe distressing you, then you shall blow with the trumpets, and you shall be remembered before Jehovah your God. And you shall be saved from your enemies.

10. And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed times, and in your new moons, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings And they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Jehovah your God.

31. And he said, Please do not forsake us, because you know as to how we encamp in the wilderness, and you shall be to us for eyes.

## Numbers 11

1. And the people were evil, as those complaining in the ears of Jehovah. And Jehovah heard, and His anger glowed, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them and devoured in the extreme edge of the camp.

2. And the people cried to Moses, and Moses prayed to Jehovah, and the fire was quenched.

3. And he called the name of that place Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burned among them.   

4. And the mixed multitude among them lusted with a great lust; and the sons of Israel also turned back and wept, and said, Who shall cause us to eat flesh?

5. We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;

6. and now our soul withers. There is nothing except this manna before our eyes.

7. And the manna was like coriander seed, and its look like the look of bdellium resin gum.

8. And the people went around and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in a pan, and made it into cakes. And its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.

9. And when the dew came down on the camp by night, the manna came down on it.

10. And Moses heard the people weeping by its families, each at the door of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah glowed exceedingly, and in the eyes of Moses it was evil.

11. And Moses said to Jehovah, Why have You done evil to Your servant; and why have I not found grace in Your eyes to put the burden of all this people on me?

12. I, have I conceived all this people? I, have I begotten it, that You say to me, Carry it in your bosom as the foster father bears the suckling, to the land which You have sworn to its fathers?

13.  Where shall I get flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give to us flesh that we may eat.

14. I am not able, I alone, to bear all this people, for it is too heavy for me;

15. and if You deal thus with me, please quickly kill me, if I have found grace in Your eyes, and let me not look on my affliction.   

16. And Jehovah said to Moses, assemble to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you have known that they are elders of the people, and its officers. And you shall take them to the tabernacle of the congregation; and they shall station themselves there with you.

17. And I shall come down and speak with you there; and I will take of the spirit which is upon you, and will put it on them; and they will bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone.

18. And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh. For you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh, for we had good in Egypt? And Jehovah shall give flesh to you, and you shall eat.

19. You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days;

20.  but to a month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils, and it shall become to you a loathsome thing; because you have loathed Jehovah, who is in your midst, and weep before Him, saying, Why is it that we have come out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, The people in whose midst I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and You, You have said, I shall give flesh to them, and they shall eat a month of days.

22. Shall flock and herd be slaughtered for them, so one may find for them? Ar all the fish in the sea to be gathered for them, that one may find for them?

23. And Jehovah said to Moses, Is the hand of Jehovah shortened? Now you shall see whether My word shall come to pass to you or not.   

24. And Moses went out and spoke to the people the words of Jehovah and gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and caused them to stand around the tabernacle.

25. And Jehovah came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took of the spirit which was on him, and put it on the seventy men of the elders. And it happened, as the spirit rested on them, that they prophesied, but they did not continue.

26. And two of the men were left in the camp, the name of the one being Eldad, and the name of the second Medad; and the spirit rested on them, and they were among those written, but did not go out to the tabernacle And they prophesied in the camp.

27. And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.

28. And Joshua the son of Nun, minister to Moses, of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, stop them.

29. And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put His spirit on them!

30. And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.   

31. And a wind went forth from Jehovah and cut off quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as a day's journey here, and as a day's journey there, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the land.

32. And the people rose up all that day, and all that night, and the day after, and gathered the quails; he who had least had gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves around the camp.

33. The flesh was yet between their teeth, it was not yet cut off, and the anger of Jehovah glowed among the people. And Jehovah struck among the people with a very great plague.

34. And one called the name of that place, The Graves of Lust; for there they buried the people who lusted.

35. From the Graves of Lust the people pulled up to go to Hazeroth, and they remained in Hazeroth.  

## Numbers 12

1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken. For he had taken a Cushite woman.

2. And they said, Has Jehovah spoken only by Moses? Has He not also spoken by us? And Jehovah heard.

3. And the man Moses was very meek, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.   

4. And Jehovah said suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, You three come out to the tabernacle of the congregation. And the three of them came out.

5. And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood at the tabernacle door, and called Aaron and Miriam. And both of them came out.

6. And He said, Now hear My words, If your prophet is of Jehovah, I shall make Myself known to him in an appearance; I will speak to him in a dream.

7. It is not so with My servant Moses! He is faithful in all My house.

8. I speak to him mouth to mouth, and by an appearance, and not in riddles; and he carefully looks upon the form of Jehovah. So why have you not been afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?

9. And the anger of Jehovah glowed against them, and He left.   

10. And the cloud turned away from the tent. And, behold Miriam was leprous as snow! And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous!

11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh my lord, I beg you, do not lay sin upon us, by which we have done foolishly, and by which we have sinned.

12. I beg you, do not let her be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.

13. And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, O God, I beg You, give healing to her, I beseech You.

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had but spat in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? She shall be shut out seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterward she shall be brought in.

15. And Miriam was shut out at the outside of the camp seven days, and the people did not pull up stakes until Miriam was brought in.

16. And afterward the people pulled up from Hazeroth, and they encamped in the wilderness of Paran.  

## Numbers 13

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Send men for you, and they shall spy out the land of Canaan which I am giving to the sons of Israel; you shall send one man for the tribe of his fathers, one man, every one a leader among them.

3. And by the command of Jehovah Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran they were all of them men, heads of the sons of Israel.

4. And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;

5. of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;

6. of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;

7. of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;

8. of the tribe of Ephraim, Joshua the son of Nun;

9. of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;

10. of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;

11. of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;

12. of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;

13. of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;

14. of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;

15. of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

16. These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun, Joshua.

17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, You go up this way into the Negeb, and go up into the hills;

18. and you shall see the land, what it is , and the people who are living on it, whether it is strong or feeble; whether it is few or many;

19. and what the land is in which they live, whether good or bad; and what are the cities in which they live, whether in camps or in fortresses;

20. and what the land is , whether it is fat or lean; whether wood is in it or not. And you shall make yourselves strong and shall take of the fruit of the land. And it was the days of the firstripe grapes.   

21. And they went up and spied out the land, from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, at the entrance to Hamath.

22. And they went up into the Negeb, and came to Hebron. And Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak, were there. And Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.

23. And they came in to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch and one cluster of grapes. And they carried it on a staff by two; also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

24. That place was called the Torrent of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut from there.

25. And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.   

26. And they traveled and came in to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the tabernacle of the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh. And they brought them and all the congregation word, and showed them the fruit of the land.

27. And they reported to him and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and it surely does flow with milk and honey; and this is its fruit.

28. But the people that live in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified, very great. And also we have seen the children of Anak there.

29. Amalek lives in the land of the Negeb, and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite live in the hills. And the Canaanite is living by the sea, and beside the Jordan.

30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, We will certainly go up, and we will seize it, for we are well able to do it.

31. And the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for it is stronger than we.

32. And they sent out an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land into which we passed, to spy it out, is a land eating up its inhabitants. And all the people we saw in its midst  were men of stature.

33. And we saw the giants there, the sons of Anak, of the Giants. and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers, and so we were in their eyes.  

## Numbers 14

1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried; and the people wept during that night.

2. And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron. And all the congregation said to them, Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness, oh that we had died!

3. And why is Jehovah bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our infants shall become a prey. Is it not good for us to return to Egypt?

4. And they said each to his brother, Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.   

5. And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.

6. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who spied out the land, tore their garments.

7. And they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, The land into which we passed, to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.

8. If Jehovah has delighted in us, then He will bring us into this land and will give it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey.

9. Only, do not rebel against Jehovah. And you, do not fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their defense has turned away from them; and Jehovah is with us; do not be afraid of them.

10. And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation, to all the sons of Israel.   

11. And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people despise Me? And How long will they continue not to believe in Me, for all the signs which I have done in its midst?

12. I shall strike it with pestilence and dispossess it. And I will make you a nation greater and mightier than it.

13. And Moses said to Jehovah, And the Egyptians will hear. For You have brought up this people out of their midst with Your power.

14. And they will say to the inhabitant of this land, They have heard that You, Jehovah, are in the midst of this people, who is seen eye with eye. You are Jehovah, and Your cloud stands over them; in a pillar of cloud You go before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.

15. And will You execute this people as one man? Then the nations who have heard Your fame will speak, saying,

16. Because Jehovah is not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, therefore He has slain them in the wilderness.

17. And now, I beseech You, let the power of my Lord be great, as You have spoken, saying,

18. Jehovah is slow to anger, and of great mercy, bearing away iniquity and transgression; and by no means will clear the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons, on the third and on the fourth generation .

19. I beseech You, forgive the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of Your mercy, and as You have gone with this people from Egypt, even until now.   

20. And Jehovah said, I have forgiven according to your words;

21. but as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;

22. for all the men who are seeing My glory, and My miracles which I have done in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tried Me these ten times, and have not listened to My voice,

23. they shall not see the land which I have sworn to their fathers. Yea, not one of those scorning Me shall see it.

24. And My servant Caleb, because there is another spirit in him, and he is fully following Me, I shall bring him into the land into which he has gone, and his seed shall possess it.

25. And the Amalekite and the Canaanite were living in the valley. Tomorrow turn and pull up stakes for yourselves; going into the wilderness, the way of the Sea of Reeds.

26. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

27. Until when shall I bear with this evil company who are murmuring against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against Me.

28. Say to them, As I live, says Jehovah, as surely as you have spoken in My ears, so I will do to you.

29. Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, even all your numbered ones, as to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, in that you have murmured against Me.

30. You shall certainly not come into the land which I lifted up My hand to cause you to live in it, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.

31. As for your infants, of whom you have said, They shall be a prey, I shall bring them in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.

32. As for you, your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.

33. And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your fornications until your carcases are wasted in the wilderness;

34. by the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, a day for a year, a day for a year; you shall bear your iniquities forty years; you shall know My alienation from you .

35. I am Jehovah; I shall spoken. I shall do this to all this evil company who are gathered together against Me. They shall be brought to an end in this wilderness, and there they shall die.   

36. And the men whom Moses had sent to spy out the land, and who, when they returned, made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,

37. even those men bringing up an evil report of the land died by the plague before Jehovah.

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.

39. And Moses told these words to all the sons of Israel; and the people mourned deeply.

40. And they rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we are here, and we will go up to the place which Jehovah has said, for we have sinned.

41. And Moses said, Why do you now transgress the mouth of Jehovah, since it will not prosper?

42. Do not go up, for Jehovah is not in your midst, even that you shall not be defeated by your enemies.

43. For the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there before you; and you shall fall by the sword because you have turned back from following Jehovah; and Jehovah is not with you.

44. And they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses did not leave the middle of the camp.

45. And the Amalekite and the Canaanite living in that mountain came down and struck them, and beat them down, to Hormah.  

## Numbers 15

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you have come to the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,

3. then you shall prepare a fire offering to Jehovah, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfillment of a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your appointed seasons, to make a soothing fragrance to Jehovah, out of the herd, or out of the flock.

4. And he who is bringing his offering to Jehovah shall bring near a food offering of flour, a tenth part, mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil;

5. and wine for a drink offering, a fourth of a hin you shall prepare for the burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, for the one lamb.

6. Or you shall prepare a food offering of flour for a ram, two tenth parts mixed with oil, a third of a hin;

7. and wine for a drink offering, a third part of a hin. You shall bring it near, a soothing fragrance to Jehovah.

8. And when you prepare a son of the herd for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, in fulfillment of a vow, or peace offerings to Jehovah,

9. then he shall bring near for the son of the herd a food offering of flour, three tenth parts, mixed with oil, a half of a hin;

10. and you shall bring wine near for a drink offering, a half of a hin, as a fire offering of soothing fragrance to Jehovah.

11. So it shall be done for one ox, or for the one ram, or for a lamb of the sheep, or of the goats.

12. You shall prepare according to the number. So you shall do for everyone according to their number.

13. All that are homeborn shall do these things in this way, in bringing in an offering made by fire, of a soothing fragrance to Jehovah.

14. And if an alien lives with you, or whoever may be among you, throughout your generations, and desires to offer a fire offering of a soothing fragrance to Jehovah; as you do, so he shall do.

15. As for the congregation, there shall be one statute both for you and for the alien that lives with you , a never ending statute throughout your generations; as you are , so shall the alien be before Jehovah.

16. There shall be one law and one ordinance both for you and for the alien that lives with you.

17. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land to which I bring you,

19. then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall lift up a heave offering to Jehovah.

20. You shall lift up a cake of the first of your dough as a heave offering; as the heave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall lift it up.

21. You shall give of the first of your dough to Jehovah, a heave offering for your generations.   

22. And when you shall err and shall not perform all these commands which Jehovah has spoken to Moses,

23. even all that Jehovah has commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that Jehovah commanded, and onward for your generations,

24. then it shall be, if it be done in error by the congregation, by ignorance, even all the congregation shall offer a son of the herd, one bullock, for a burnt offering, for a soothing fragrance to Jehovah, and its food offering, and its drink offering, according to the ordinance; and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

25. And the priest shall atone for all the congregation of the sons of Israel; and it shall be forgiven them. For it was in error, and they have brought their offering, a fire offering to Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah for their error.

26. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and the alien that lives among them, shall be forgiven; for as to all the people, it was in ignorance.

27. And if one person sins through error, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

28. And the priest shall atone for the soul that errs when he sins through error, before Jehovah, to atone for him. And he shall be forgiven,

29. both the homeborn among the sons of Israel, and the alien that lives among them; one law shall be to you for him who acts in error.   

30. And the soul that does anything with a high hand, whether of a homeborn or of the alien, the same blasphemes Jehovah. And that person shall be cut off from the midst of his people.

31. For he has despised the word of Jehovah and has broken His command; that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.

32. And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day.

33. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

34. And they put him under guard; for it had not been declared what should be done to him.

35. And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.

36. And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones. And he died, as Jehovah commanded Moses.   

37. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

38. Speak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them that they shall make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments, for their generations. And they shall put with the fringe of each corner thread of blue.

39. And It shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look on it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that you do not go about after your own heart and your own eyes after which you go astray;

40. that you may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy to your God.

41. I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am Jehovah your God.  

## Numbers 16

1. And Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, took both Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, the sons of Reuben;

2. and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty rulers of the congregation, elect men of the assembly, men of name.

3. And they were assembled against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much! For all the congregation, all of them are holy, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you lift up yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?

4. And Moses heard and fell on his face.

5. And he spoke to Korah, and to all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are His, and him who is holy, and shall cause him to come near Him; even him whom He may choose, He will cause to come near to Him.

6. Do this: take fire-pans for yourselves, Korah, and all his company,

7. and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow; and it shall be, the man whom Jehovah chooses, he shall be the holy one. You take too much, sons of Levi!

8. And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi,

9. is it but a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?

10. Yea, He has brought you near, and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you. And will you seek the priesthood also?

11. Therefore, you and all your company that have gathered against Jehovah, What is Aaron that you murmur against him?   

12. And Moses sent to call for Dathan and for Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up.

13. Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but must you also certainly seize dominion over us?

14. Yea, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance in fields and vineyards; will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!

15. And Moses was very angry, and said to Jehovah, Do not respect their offering; I have not taken one ass from them, nor have I done evil to one of them.

16. And Moses said to Korah, You and all your company, you be there before Jehovah, you and they, and Aaron tomorrow.

17. And each one take his fire-pan, and you shall put incense on them, and shall offer before Jehovah, each his fire-pan, two hundred and fifty fire-pans; even you and Aaron, each his fire-pan.

18. And they each took his fire-pan, and put fire on them, and lay incense on them, and they stood at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, with Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah assembled all the congregation against them, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the glory of Jehovah was seen by all the congregation.

20. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

21. separate yourselves from the midst of this company, and I will consume them in a moment.

22. And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, God of the spirits of all flesh; shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the congregation?   

23. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the congregation, saying, You get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

25. And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel went after him.

26. And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Please turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that they have, lest you be consumed in all their sins.

27. And they got away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out, standing at the door of their tents, and their wives, their sons, and their infants.

28. And Moses said, By this you shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, and that not from my own heart.

29. If these die according to the death of all men, and are visited according to the visitation of all men, then Jehovah has not sent me.

30. And if Jehovah makes a new thing, and the ground opens her mouth and swallows them, and all that they have, and they go down alive to Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised Jehovah.

31. And it happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words, the ground which was under them split apart,

32. and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them, and their houses, and all the men who were for Korah, and all their possessions.

33. And they went down, they and all that they had, alive to Sheol, and the earth covered over them; and they perished from the midst of the assembly.

34. And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.   

35. And fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.

36. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

37. Speak to Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, and he shall lift up the fire-pans from the midst of the burning, and shall scatter the fire yonder, for they have become holy,

38. the fire-pans of these sinners against their own souls. And they shall make of them spreadout plates, a covering for the altar, for they have brought them near before Jehovah, and they are holy. And they shall become a sign to the sons of Israel.

39. And Eleazar the priest took the bronze fire-pans, which they who were burned had brought near, and they spread them out, a covering for the altar,

40. a memorial to the sons of Israel, so that an alien who is not of the seed of Aaron shall not draw near to offer incense before Jehovah, and shall not be as Korah, and as his company; as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses to him.   

41. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured on the next day against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of Jehovah.

42. And it happened, as the company was called together against Moses and against Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of the congregation. And, behold, the cloud had covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared!

43. And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tabernacle of the congregation.

44. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

45. Get away from the midst of this company, and I shall consume them in a moment; and they fell on their faces.

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take the fire-pan, and put fire on it from the altar, and lay on incense, and go, hurry to the congregation, and atone for them, for the wrath has gone out from the presence of Jehovah; the plague has begun.

47. And Aaron did as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly. And, behold, the plague had begun among the people! And he laid on the incense and atoned for the people,

48. and stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stayed.

49. And those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died for the matter of Korah.

50. And Aaron turned back to Moses, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and the plague was stayed.  

## Numbers 17

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from each of them a rod, for a father's house, from all their rulers, for the house of their fathers, twelve rods. You shall write the name of each on his rod.

3. And you shall write Aaron's name on the staff of the tribe of Levi; for one rod shall be for the head of their fathers' house.

4. And you shall place them in the tabernacle of the congregation, before the testimony, where I shall meet with you.

5. And it shall be that the man's rod which I choose shall blossom. And I shall cause the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you, to cease from Me.

6. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their rulers gave to him one rod for each ruler, one rod for a ruler, for their fathers' house, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among the rods.

7. And Moses placed the rods before Jehovah, in the tabernacle of the testimony.   

8. And it happened on the next day, Moses went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and, behold! The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.

9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel. And they looked, and each one took his rod.

10. And Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron, before the testimony, to be kept as a token to the sons of rebellion. And you shall end their murmurings off Me; and they shall not die.

11. And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him; so he did.

12. And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die. we perish, we all perish.

13. Anyone who draws near to the tabernacle of Jehovah shall die; shall we be consumed to die?  

## Numbers 18

1. And Jehovah said to Aaron, You, and your sons, and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. And you, and your sons with you, shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood;

2. and also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, you shall bring near with you, that they may be joined to you and may minister to you, you and your sons in your being before the tabernacle of the testimony.

3. And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tabernacle; only, they shall not go near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar. And they shall not die either they or you.

4. And they shall be joined to you, and shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle, and a stranger shall not go near to you.

5. And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, and there shall be no more wrath against the sons of Israel.

6. And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel; as a gift they are given to you by Jehovah, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

7. And you, and your sons with you, shall keep your priesthood, in everything that pertains to the altar, and to that inside the veil. And you shall serve; I have given you the priesthood as a service of gift; and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.   

8. And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying, And I, behold, I have given to you the charge of My heave offerings, of all the dedicated things of the sons of Israel. I have given them to you for the anointing, and to your sons, by a never ending statute.

9. This shall be yours of the most holy things, from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every food offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they may render to Me; it shall be most holy to you, and to your sons.

10. You shall eat it in the Holy of Holies; every male shall eat it; it shall be holy to you.

11. And this is yours, the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons, and to your daughters with you, by a never ending statute; every clean one in your house shall eat it.

12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and wheat, the firstfruits of them which they give to Jehovah, I have given to you.

13. The firstfruits of all that is in their land, which they bring in to Jehovah shall be yours; every clean one in your house shall eat it;

14. every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours;

15. every one opening a womb of all flesh which they offer to Jehovah, among man and among animal, shall be yours. Only, you shall certainly redeem the first-born of man, and you shall redeem the firstling of the unclean beasts.

16. And their redeemed ones, from a month old, you shall redeem with your valuation of silver, five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary; it is twenty gerahs.

17. But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and you shall burn their fat as incense, a fire offering of soothing fragrance to Jehovah.

18. And their flesh shall be yours, as the breast of the wave offering, and as the right leg; it shall be yours.

19. All the heave offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel shall lift up to Jehovah, I have given to you and to your sons, and to your daughters with you, by a never ending statute, a covenant of salt, it shall be forever before Jehovah to you and to your seed with you.   

20. And Jehovah said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.

21. And, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel to the sons of Levi for an inheritance, in return for their service which they are serving, the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

22. And the sons of Israel shall not come near to the tabernacle of the congregation any more, lest they bear sin, and die.

23. But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a never ending statute throughout your generations, that in the midst of the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance;

24. but the tithes of the sons of Israel which they shall lift up to Jehovah, a heave offering, I have given to the Levites for inheritance; therefore I have said to them, They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.

25. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

26. And you shall say to the Levites; and you shall speak to them, When you take the tithe from the sons of Israel, which I have given to you from them, for your inheritance, then you shall lift from it a heave offering of Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.

27. And your heave offering shall be counted to you as grain from the threshing floor, and as fullness from the winepress.

28. So you also shall lift up the heave offering of Jehovah from all your tithes which you receive from the sons of Israel. And you shall give from it the heave offering of Jehovah to Aaron the priest.

29. You shall lift up the whole heave offering of Jehovah out of all your gifts, out of all its fat, its holy part, out of it.

30. And you shall say to them, When you lift up its fat out of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as increase of a threshing floor, and as increase of a winepress.

31. And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.

32. And you shall bear no sin because of it, since you have lifted up from it the best of it. And you shall not profaned the holy things of the sons of Israel so that you may not die.  

## Numbers 19

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer, a perfect one, in which there is no blemish, on which no yoke ever came.

3. And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and she shall be brought forth outside the camp; and she shall be slaughtered before his face.

4. And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.

5. And the heifer shall be burned before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood with her dung, shall be burned.

6. And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop and scarlet, and shall cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.

8. And he that burned her shall wash his clothes in water, and shall bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.

9. And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and shall lay them up outside the camp in a clean place. And it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water of impurity; it is a purging offering.

10. And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the evening; and it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger that lives among them, for a never ending statute.   

11. He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.

12. He shall cleanse himself for it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean. And if he does not cleanse himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he shall not be clean.

13. Anyone who touches the dead body, the body of a man who dies, and does not cleanse himself, he shall have defiled the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from Israel, for the water of impurity shall not be sprinkled upon him. He shall be unclean; his uncleanness shall be still on him.

14. This is the law when a man dies in a tent: Everyone who comes into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

15. And every open vessel which has no covering of thread on it shall be unclean.

16. And whoever in the open field touches one that has been pierced with a sword, or one that has died of himself, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

17. And for the unclean they shall take the ashes of the burning of the purging offering, and running water in a vessel shall be put on it.

18. And a clean person shall take hyssop, and shall dip it in the water, and shall sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave.

19. And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.

20. But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he shall be unclean.

21. And it shall be a never ending statute to them; and he that sprinkles the water of impurity shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until evening.

22. And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening.  

## Numbers 20

1. And the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people remained in Kadesh. And Miriam died there, and was buried there.

2. And there was no water for the congregation, and they were gathered against Moses, and against Aaron.

3. And the people contended with Moses, and spoke, saying, Oh that we had died when our brothers died before Jehovah!

4. And, why have you brought the assembly of Jehovah to this wilderness to die there, we and our animals?

5. And, why have you brought us up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place, not a place of seed, nor fig, nor vine, nor pomegranate; and there is no water to drink?

6. And Moses and Aaron went in from the eyes of the assembly, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and fell on their faces. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.

7. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

8. Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you and your brother Aaron. And speak to the rock before their eyes. And it shall give forth its water; and you shall bring water out of the rock to them; so you shall water the congregation and their animals.

9. And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as He commanded him.

10. And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock. And he said to them, Hear now, you rebels, shall we bring forth water to you out of this rock?

11. And Moses lifted up his hand and smote the rock with his rod twice; and much water came out; and the congregation and their animals drank.

12. And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring in this congregation to the land which I have given to them.

13. These are the Waters of Strife, because the sons of Israel contended with Jehovah, and He was sanctified upon them.   

14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: So says your brother Israel, You surely have known all the travail which has found us;

15. that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians did evil to us and to our fathers.

16. And we cried to Jehovah, and He heard our voice, and sent a messenger, and is bringing us out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.

17. Please let us pass over, through your land; we shall not pass over through a field, nor through a vineyard, nor shall we drink water of a well; we shall go along the king's highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed your border.

18. And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.

19. And the sons of Israel said to him, We shall go in the highway; and if we drink of your waters, our cattle and us, then I shall give their price. Only let me pass through on my feet; there shall be no harm.

20. And he said, You shall not pass through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.

21. And Edom refused to allow Israel to pass over through his border. And Israel turned away from him.   

22. And the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, pulled up stakes from Kadesh and came in to Mount Hor.

23. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom, saying,

24. Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not go into the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My mouth at the Waters of Strife.

25. Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and cause them to go up to Mount Hor;

26. and strip Aaron of his garments, and you shall put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron shall be gathered and shall die there.

27. And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded; and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation.

28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and clothed his son Eleazar with them. And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

29. And all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, and they mourned Aaron thirty days, all the house of Israel.  

## Numbers 21

1. And king Arad the Canaanite, who lived in the south, heard that Israel had come the Way of Spies; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.

2. And Israel vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.

3. And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities; and the name of the place was called Hormah.   

4. And they pulled up from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Reeds, to go around the land of Edom. And the soul of the people became impatient because of the way.

5. And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul hates this light bread.

6. And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people; and they bit the people, and many people of Israel died.

7. And the people came in to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against Jehovah, and against you. Pray to Jehovah, and He shall turn the serpent away from us. And Moses prayed on behalf of the people.

8. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Make yourself a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that when anyone is bitten, when he sees it, he shall live.

9. And Moses made a serpent of bronze and put it on a pole; and it happened, if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived.   

10. And the sons of Israel pulled up stakes and encamped in Oboth.

11. And they pulled up from Oboth, and camped in Ijeabarim, in the wilderness that is before Moab, toward the rising of the sun.

12. From there they pulled up and camped in the valley of Zered.

13. From there they pulled up and camped beyond Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorite; for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorite;

14. therefore, it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: Waheb in Suphah, the torrents of Arnon,

15. and the slope of the torrent-beds that turn down toward the site of Ar, and lean on the border of Moab.

16. And from there they went to Beer; that is the well of which Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying , Gather the people and I will give water to them.

17. Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well, sing to it;

18. The well which the rulers dug, which the nobles of the people dug with their staves, at the word of the Lawgiver. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah.

19. And from Mattanah they went to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;

20. and from Bamoth in the valley which is in the field of Moab to the top of Pisgah, and looking toward the wilderness.   

21. And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

22. Let me pass through your land; we will not turn into a field or into a vineyard; we will not drink waters of a well; we will go in the king's highway until we have passed over your border.

23. And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. And Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel in the wilderness, and they came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.

24. And Israel struck him by the mouth of the sword and seized his land, from Arnon to Jabbok, to the sons of Ammon. For the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.

25. And Israel took all these cities. And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorite, in Heshbon and in all its daughter villages.

26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites. And he had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken his land out of his hand, to Arnon.

27. On account of this the parable speakers say, Come to Heshbon! Let the city of Sihon be built and established!

28. For a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it has consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon.

29. Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.

30. We have cast them down; Heshbon has perished, even to Dibon; and we have ravaged even to Nophah, which is to Medeba.

31. And Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its villages and drove out the Amorite who was there.

33. And they turned and went the way of Bashan. And Og king of Bashan came out to meet them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

34. And Jehovah said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land. And you shall do to him as you have done to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

35. And they struck him and his sons and all his people until he did not have a remnant left. And they seized his land.  

## Numbers 22

1. And the sons of Israel pulled up stakes and camped on the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, by Jericho.

2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

3. And Moab greatly feared because of the people, for it was many. And Moab was vexed by the presence of the sons of Israel.

4. And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now this assembly is licking up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.

5. And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor which is beside the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, Behold! A people has come out of Egypt. Behold! it has covered the face of the earth, and it is setting next to me.

6. And now please come, curse this people for me, for it is stronger than I. Perhaps I will prevail, that we may strike them, that I may drive them out from the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.

7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian left with the rewards of the seer in their hand. And they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him.

8. And he said to them, Stay here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, even as Jehovah may speak to me. And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?

10. And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab has sent to me,

11.  saying , Behold, a people has come out of Egypt which covers the eye of the earth. Now come, curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to overcome it and drive it out.

12. And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for it is blessed.

13. And Balaam rose in the morning and said to the leaders of Balak. Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to allow me to go with you.

14. And the leaders of Moab rose up and came to Balak. And they said, Balaam refuses to come with us.   

15. And Balak sent yet again, more leaders and more honorable than they.

16. And they came to Balaam and said to him, So says Balak the son of Zippor, Please do not be hindered from coming to me,

17. for I will honor you with very much honor; and all that you say to me I will do. And please come, curse this people for me.

18. And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give to me his house full of gold and silver, I could not go beyond the mouth of Jehovah my God, to do anything, small or great.

19. And now you also please stay here tonight. And I shall know what more Jehovah may speak to me.

20. And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them and say only the thing that I speak to you; it you shall do.

21. And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the leaders of Moab.   

22. And the anger of God glowed because he went. And the Angel of Jehovah set Himself in the road, as an enemy against him. And he was riding on his ass, and two of his young men with him.

23. And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the road, and His sword was drawn in His hand. And the ass turned out of the road and went into a field. And Balaam struck the ass, to turn it back into the road.

24. And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side and a wall on that.

25. And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and she pushed herself to the wall and crushed the foot of Balaam against the wall. And again he struck her.

26. And again the Angel of Jehovah passed on and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn, either to the right or to the left.

27. And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam. And the anger of Balaam glowed, and he struck the ass with his staff.

28. And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?

29. And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have insulted Me. if only there were a sword in my hand now I would kill you.

30. And the ass said to Balaam, Am I not your ass on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever known to do so to you? And he said, No.

31. And Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the road with His sword drawn in His hand. And he bowed and fell on his face.

32. And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your ass these three times? Behold, I have come out as an enemy because your way is contrary to Me.

33. And the ass saw Me and turned aside before Me these three times. If she had not turned aside surely now I would have killed you and saved her alive.

34. And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know that You stood against me in the way. Now if evil is in Your eyes, I will turn back by myself.

35. And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men. But only the word that I speak to you, it you shall speak. And Balaam went with the leaders of Balak.   

36. And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, and had gone out to meet him, to a city of Moab which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the outermost border,

37. then Balak said to Balaam, Sending, did I not send to you, to call for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not truly able to honor you?

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you. Now am I able to speak anything at all? The word which God puts in my mouth, that I will speak.

39. And Balaam went with Balak. And they came to Kirjath-huzoth.

40. And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam and to the leaders who were with him.

41. And it happened in the morning, and Balak took Balaam and caused him to go up to the high places of Baal. And from there he saw the edge of the people.  

## Numbers 23

1. And Balaam said to Balak, Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bullocks and seven rams for me here.

2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam offered a bullock and a ram on the altar.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, Station yourself by your burnt offering, and I will go on; it may be that Jehovah will come to meet me, and I will declare to you the things which He reveals to Me. and he went to a high place.

4. And God came to Balaam, and he said to Him, I have set up seven altars. And I have offered a bullock and a ram on the altar.

5. And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and you shall say this.

6. And he returned to him. And, lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.

7. And he took up his parable and said, He has led me from Aram, Balak king of Moab; from the mountains of the east, saying , Come, curse Jacob for me; and, come, rage at Israel.

8. How shall I curse him whom God has not cursed? And how shall I rage at him whom Jehovah has not raged at?

9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, and I behold him from the heights. Behold, it is a people that shall dwell alone and not be reckoned among the nations.

10. Who can count Jacob's dust, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and lo you have surely blessed.

12. And he replied and said, Must not I take heed to speak what Jehovah has put in my mouth?   

13. And Balak said to him, Now come with me to another place where you will see it; only you will see its edge and shall not see all of it; and curse it for me there.

14. And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on the altar.

15. And he said to Balak, Stand here by the burnt offering while I go to meet Him over there.

16. And Jehovah met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, Return to Balak, and say this.

17. And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and Moab's chiefs with him. And he said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?

18. And he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; give ear to me, son of Zippor.

19. God is not a man that He should lie, or a son of man that He should repent. Has He said, and shall He not do it? And has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?

20. Behold, I have received word to bless; yes, He has blessed; I cannot reverse it.

21. He has seen no iniquity in Jacob, nor has He seen mischief in Israel. Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in him.

22. God who brought them out of Egypt is for him like the lofty horns of the wild ox.

23. For there is not a spell against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel. Now it is said of Jacob and Israel, See what God has done!

24. Behold, the people shall rise like a lioness and as a lion he shall lift himself up; he shall not lie down until he eats the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Do not curse it at all, nor bless it at all.

26. And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not speak to you, saying, All that Jehovah speaks, that I will do?

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Come, please, I will take you to another place. It may be that it will be right in the eyes of God to curse it for me from there.

28. And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks toward the wilderness.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bullocks and seven rams for me here.

30. And Balak did as Balaam said; and he offered a bullock and a ram on the altar.  

## Numbers 24

1. And Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, and he did not go, as at other times to seek spells. And he set his face toward the wilderness.

2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping, by its tribes. And the Spirit of God was on him.

3. And he took up his parable and said, The saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eyes have been opened;

4. the saying of him who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, fallen down, yet with open eyes:

5. How good are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel!

6. They are spread out like valleys, like gardens by a river; and Jehovah has planted aloes, as cedars beside the water.

7. He makes water flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters; his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom exalted.

8. God who has brought him out of Egypt is for him like the lofty horns of the wild ox; he shall eat up the nations that are his foes, and shall break their bones in pieces, and shall pierce them through with his arrows.

9. He has crouched; he has lain down like a lion, and like a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed is everyone that blesses you, and cursed is everyone that curses you.   

10. And Balak's anger glowed against Balaam, and he struck his palms together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies; and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.

11. And now, flee to your place. I thought to honor you with great honor, but, behold, Jehovah has kept you back from honor.

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak to your messengers that you sent to me, saying,

13. If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the mouth of Jehovah, to do good or bad of my own heart. What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak.

14. And now, behold, I go to my people. Come, and I will counsel you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.   

15. And he took up his parable and said, The saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eyes are opened;

16. the saying of him who hears the words of God, and knows the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, yet with open eyes:

17. I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not near. A star shall come forth out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall dash the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of tumult.

18. And Edom shall be a possession; and Seir shall be a possession, for his foes; but Israel shall do mightily.

19. And one out of Jacob shall rule, and will destroy the survivors from Ar.

20. And he looked upon Amalek, and took up his parable and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end is to destruction forever.

21. And he looked upon the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Your dwellingplace may be enduring, and your nest may be set in a rock.

22. But the Kenites shall be consumed, until Assyria shall carry you away.

23. And he took up his parable and said, Alas! Who shall live when God puts out?

24. And ships shall come from the coast of Cyprus, and they shall humble Assyria, and they shall humble Eber, and he also shall come to destruction forever.

25. And Balaam rose up and left, and returned to his place; and Balak also went on his way.  

## Numbers 25

1. And Israel lived in Shittim. And the people began to fornicate with the daughters of Moab.

2. And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. And the people ate and bowed themselves to their gods.

3. And Israel was joined to Baal-peor, and the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel.

4. And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the leaders of the people and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel.

5. And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Each one of you kill his men, those who joined to Baal-peor.   

6. And, behold! A man of the sons of Israel came and brought in to his brothers a woman of Midian, before the eyes of Moses and before the eyes of all the congregation of the sons of Israel weeping at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

7. And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar. the son of Aaron the priest, saw. And he rose from amidst the congregation and took a javelin in his hand,

8. and went in after the man of Israel, into the tent room. And he pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the sons of Israel.

9. And those that died by the plague were twenty four thousand.

10. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the sons of Israel while he was zealous for My sake among them, so that I did not consume the sons of Israel in My jealousy.

12. Therefore say, behold, I give to him My covenant of peace;

13. And it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and atone for the sons of Israel.

16. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Vex the Midianites; and you shall strike them;

18. For they are vexers to you, because of the wiles with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi the daughter of a ruler of Midian, their sister, who was struck in the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.

## Numbers 30

1. And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded:

2. When a man vows a vow to Jehovah, or has sworn an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do all that has gone out of his mouth.   

3. And when a woman vows a vow to Jehovah, and has bound a bond in the house of her father in her youth,

4. and her father has heard her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father has remained silent as to her, then all her vows shall stand; and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

5. But if her father has prohibited her in the day he heard, none of her vows and her bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand. And Jehovah will forgive her because her father prohibited her.

6. And if she belongs to a husband, and her vows are on her, or a rash utterance on her lips with which she has bound her soul,

7. and her husband has heard, and in the day he heard he has remained silent as to her, then her vows shall stand, and her bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

8. And if in the day her husband hears, he prohibits her, then he has broken her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips with which she has bound her soul. And Jehovah will forgive her.

9. And as to the vow of a widow, or her that is divorced, all that she has bound on her soul shall be established on her.

10. And if she has vowed in the house of her husband, or bound a bond on her soul with an oath,

11. and her husband has heard, and has remained silent as to her, and he has not prohibited her, then all her vows shall be established, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

12. And if her husband has certainly broken them in the day he heard, none of the utterance of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall stand; her husband has broken them. And Jehovah will forgive her.

13. Every vow and every oath, any bond to humble a soul, her husband shall establish it, or her husband shall break it.

14. And if her husband is altogether silent at her from day to day, then he has established all her vows or all her bonds which are on her; he has established them; for he remained silent as to her in the day he heard.

15. And if he at all breaks them after he hears, then he has borne her iniquity.

16. These are the statutes which Jehovah has commanded Moses between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter in her youth in the house of her father.  

## Numbers 31

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Execute the vengeance of the sons of Israel against the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.

3. And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Some men of you be armed for the army, and they shall be against Midian, to give the vengeance of Jehovah on Midian;

4. you shall send to the army a thousand for a tribe as to all the tribes of Israel.

5. And a thousand for a tribe were given out of the thousands of Israel, twelve thousand armed ones of the army.

6. And Moses sent them to the army, a thousand for a tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the army. Also he sent the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound in his hand.   

7. And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and killed every male.

8. And they killed the kings of Midian, besides the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.

9. And the sons of Israel took the women of Midian captive, and their infants, and all their livestock, and all their purchased things. And they plundered all their wealth.

10. And they burned all their cities with fire, their homes, and all their towers.

11. And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, among man and among animal.

12. And they brought it to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the sons of Israel; the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to the camp, to the plains of Moab which are by Jordan, near Jericho.   

13. And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the rulers of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.

14. And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds who came from the service of the war.

15. And Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?

16. Behold, these through the counsel of Balaam caused the sons of Israel a deliverance of treachery against Jehovah in the matter of Peor; and the plague was on the company of Jehovah.

17. And now kill every male among the infants; yea, you shall kill every woman having known a man by lying with a male.

18. And you shall keep alive for yourselves all the female children who have not known a man by lying with a male.

19. And encamp outside the camp seven days. Whoever has killed any person, and whoever touched a pierced one, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.

20. And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify them .

21. And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded Moses:

22. only the gold, the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead,

23. everything that passes through the fire, you shall make it go through the fire; and it shall be clean. Only it shall be purified with the water for impurity. And every thing that cannot go through the fire, you shall make go through the water.

24. And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. And afterwards you shall come into the camp.   

25. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Lift the heads of the prey of the captives. among man and among beast, you and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the congregation.

27. And you shall divide the prey between those skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.

28. And you shall levy a tribute to Jehovah from the men of war who went out to the battle: one body out of five hundred, of men, and of the herd, and of the asses, and of the flock,

29. you shall take from their half, and you shall give to Eleazar the priest as the heave offering of Jehovah.

30. And from the sons of Israel's half, you shall take one portion out of fifty, of man, and of the herd, and of the asses, and of the flock, of all the livestock, and you shall give them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

32. And the prey, the rest of the spoil which the people of the army plundered, was six hundred and seventy five thousand sheep,

33. and seventy two thousand oxen,

34. sixty one thousand of the asses;

35. and of human beings, of the women who had not known a man by lying with a male, the persons were thirty two thousand.

36. And the half, the portion of those who went out to the war, the number of the flock was three hundred and thirty seven thousand, five hundred.

37. And the tribute to Jehovah of the sheep was six hundred and seventy five,

38. and the oxen, thirty six thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, seventy two;

39. and the asses thirty thousand, five hundred; and their tribute to Jehovah, sixty one;

40. and the human beings sixteen thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, thirty two persons.

41. And Moses gave the tribute, the heave offering of Jehovah, to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

42. And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men who warred:

43. even the congregation's half was three hundred and thirty seven thousand, five hundred of the flock;

44. and of the oxen, thirty six thousand;

45. and thirty thousand, five hundred asses;

46. and sixteen thousand human beings.

47. Moses took from the sons of Israel's half the one portion from the fifty of man and of animal. And he gave them to the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.   

48. And the officers who were over the thousands of the army, heads of the thousands and heads of the hundreds, drew near to Moses.

49. And they said to Moses, Your servants have lifted the heads of the men of war who were with us, and not a man of us is missing.

50. And we bring near Jehovah's offering, each what he has found, vessels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and jewels, to atone for ourselves before Jehovah.

51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all crafted things.

52. And all the gold of the heave offering which they lifted up to Jehovah was sixteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the heads of thousands and from the heads of hundreds,

53. men of the army who had each taken spoil for himself.

54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the heads of the thousands and of the hundreds. And they brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.  

## Numbers 32

1. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had many livestock, a very great multitude. And they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead. And, behold, the place was a place for livestock.

2. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came in and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the rulers of the congregation, saying,

3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land which Jehovah has struck before the congregation of Israel is a land for livestock, and your servants own livestock.

5. And they said, If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not make us pass over the Jordan.

6. And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, Do your brothers go into the battle, and you, do you sit here?

7. And why do you discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over to the land which Jehovah has given to them?

8. So your fathers did when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.

9. And they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, and discouraged the hearts of the sons of Israel, so as for them not to go into the land which Jehovah had given to them.

10. And the anger of Jehovah glowed in that day, and He swore, saying,

11. Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob because they have not wholly followed Me;

12. except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have fully followed Jehovah.

13. And Jehovah's anger glowed against Israel. And He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah was destroyed.

14. And, behold, you have risen up in your fathers' stead. an increase of sinful men, to add still more to the heat of Jehovah toward Israel!

15. For if you turn away from following Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and so you will hurt all this people.   

16. And they came near to him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones.

17. And we ourselves shall go armed, hurrying before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

18. We will not return to our houses until each man of the sons of Israel has inherited his inheritance.

19. For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and beyond; for our inheritance has fallen to us eastward on this side of Jordan.

20. And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing; if you will arm for battle before Jehovah,

21. and all of you will go over Jordan armed before Jehovah, until He has driven His enemies out before Him,

22. and the land is subdued before Jehovah, then afterwards you shall return and be guiltless before Jehovah, and before Israel. And this land shall be your possession before Jehovah.

23. But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Jehovah, and know that your sin will find you out.

24. Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep and do that which has come out of your mouth.

25. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.

26. Our little ones, our wives our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the cities of Gilead.

27. But your servants will go over, every man armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord says.   

28. And Moses commanded Eleazar the priest concerning them, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel;

29. even Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben pass over the Jordan with you each armed for battle before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give to them the land of Gilead for a possession.

30. But if they will not go over armed with you, they shall have possession among you in the land of Canaan.

31. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben replied, saying, As Jehovah has said to your servants, so we will do.

32. We ourselves will go over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, so that the land of our inheritance on that side of Jordan may be ours.

33. And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan the land, by its cities with their borders, even the cities of the land all around.

34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

35. and Ataroth-shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

36. and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.

37. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,

38. and Nebo, and Baal-meon, their names being changed, and Sibmah. And they called by name the names of the cities which they had built.

39. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and expelled the Amorite who was in it.

40. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went out and captured their towns, and called them Towns of Jair.

42. And Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages; and he called it Nobah after his own name.

52. then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their engraved images; yea, you shall destroy all their casted images, and demolish all their high places.

53. And you shall possess the land, and live in it, for I have given you the land, to possess it.

54. And you shall inherit the land by lot, by your families. You shall increase the inheritance to the many, and you shall diminish the inheritance to the few; wherever the lot falls out to him, it is his. You shall inherit by the tribes of your fathers.

55. And if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall be, those whom you let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes, and as goads in your sides. And they will vex you on the land in which you are living.

56. And it shall be, as I thought to do to them, so I shall do to you.  

## Numbers 34

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When you have come into the land of Canaan, this is the land which falls to you by inheritance, the land of Canaan, by its borders:

3. And your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin, along by the hand of Edom, and it shall be to you a south border from the end of the Salt Sea, eastward.

4. And the border shall turn around to you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and shall pass on to Zin, and its end shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go out at Hazar-addar, and it shall pass on to Azmon.

5. And the border shall turn from Azmon to the torrent of Egypt, and its border shall be at the sea.

6. As to the western border, even the Great Sea shall be a border to you; this is your western border.

7. And this is your northern border: from the Great Sea you shall mark out for yourselves Mount Hor;

8. from Mount Hor you shall mark out a line to the entrance to Hamath; and the edge of the border shall be at Zedad.

9. And the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the edge of it shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your northern border.

10. And you shall mark out your line for the eastern border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.

11. And the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down and shall reach on the shoulder of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward.

12. And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the end of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.

13. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, This is the land which you shall receive as inheritance by lot, which Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half tribe:

14. For the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers' houses have received; and the half tribe of Manasseh shall have received their inheritance.

15. The two tribes and the half tribe shall have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.   

16. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

17. These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

18. And you shall take one ruler of every tribe, to take possession of the land.

19. And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;

20. and of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;

21. of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;

22. and of the tribe of the sons of Dan, Bukki the ruler, son of Jogli;

## Numbers 35

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab, beside Jordan, near Jericho, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites cities to live in, from the land of their possessions, and you shall give to the Levites open land for the cities.

3. And they shall have the cities to live in, and their open lands shall be for their livestock, and for their substance, and for all their animals.

4. And the open land around the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits all around.

5. And you shall measure outside the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits; the city being in the middle. This shall be to them the open land around the cities.

6. And the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge which you shall give for the manslayer that he may flee there; and besides them you shall give forty two cities.

7. All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty eight cities, them and the open land around them.

8. And you shall give the cities from the possession of the sons of Israel. From the many you shall increase, and take away from the few. According to its inheritance which it inherits each tribe shall give of its cities to the Levites.   

9. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

11. then you shall choose cities to be cities of refuge for you, so that the manslayer may flee there, he that kills a person through error.

12. And the cities shall be to you for refuge from the kinsman avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.

13. As to the cities which you shall give six shall be cities of refuge for you.

14. You shall give three of the cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three of the cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.

15. These six cities shall be for a refuge to the sons of Israel, and to an alien, and to a sojourner in their midst, that may flee there any person who kills anyone unawares.

16. And if he strikes him with an instrument of iron, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.

17. And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand, by which he dies, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall certainly be put to death.

18. And if he strikes him with a wooden instrument in the hand, by which he dies, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall certainly be put to death.

19. The avenger of blood shall himself put to death the murderer; when he meets with him, he shall put him to death.

20. And if he pushes him down, or has thrown at him by lying in wait, and he dies;

21. or if he has struck him with his hand in enmity, and he dies, the striker shall certainly be put to death; he is a murderer. When the avenger of blood meets him he shall put to death the murderer.

22. And if in an instant he pushed him without enmity, or has thrown at him anything without lying in wait;

23. or with any stone without seeing, by which he dies, and has caused it to fall on him, and he dies, and he is not an enemy to him, nor seeking his evil;

24. then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood, by these judgments.

25. And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the avenger of blood's hand. And the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge to which he had fled, and he shall live in it until the high priest dies, he who was anointed with the holy oil.

26. But if the manslayer at all goes out from the border of the city of his refuge, there to which he has fled,

27. and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, there shall be no blood guiltiness to him,

28. because he should have dwelt in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. And after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.

29. And these things shall be to you for a statute of judgment for your generations, in all your dwellings.

30. Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses. And one witness shall not testify against a person, to die.

31. And you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer; he is punishable for death, for dying he shall die.

32. And you shall take no ransom for him to flee to the city of his refuge, to return to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.

33. And you shall not pollute the land in which you are , for blood pollutes the land. And no ransom is to be taken for the land for blood which is shed in it, except for the blood of him who sheds it;

34. and you shall not defile the land in which you are living. I dwell in its midst, for I, Jehovah, am dwelling among the sons of Israel.  

## Numbers 36

1. And the heads of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near. And they spoke before Moses, and before the rulers, the heads of the fathers' houses of the sons of Israel.

2. And they said: Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel. And my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.

3. And if they shall be for wives to one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So it shall be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.

4. And when the Jubilee of the sons of Israel shall come, then their inheritance shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.   

5. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the mouth of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speak right.

6. This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be wives to those good in their eyes, only let them be for wives to the family of the tribe of their father,

7. so no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall turn from tribe to tribe, for each one of the sons of Israel shall cling to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

8. And any daughter that possesses an inheritance from any tribe of the sons of Israel to one of the family of the tribe of her father is to become a wife of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel may each possess the inheritance of his father.

9. And the inheritance shall not turn from one tribe to another tribe. For the tribes of the sons of Israel shall each one cling to its own inheritance,

10. as Jehovah commanded Moses. So the daughters of Zelophehad did.

11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, Zelophehad's daughters, were for wives to their father's brothers' sons.

12. They were for wives to the families of the son of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance was with the tribe of the family of their father.

13. These are the commandments and the judgments which Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan, near Jericho.
