## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,

2. to the church of God which is in Corinth, those having been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called-out saints, with all those calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:

3. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,

5. that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all discourse and all knowledge,

6. even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,

7. so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord, Jesus Christ,

8. who also will confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.   

10. Now I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all say the same thing, and there be no divisions among you, but you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment.

11. For concerning you, my brothers, it was shown to me by those of Chloe that there are strifes among you.

12. But I say this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

13. Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?   

14. I give thanks to God that I did not baptize one of you, except Crispus and Gaius,

15. that not anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.

16. And I also baptized the house of Stephanas. For the rest, I do not know if I baptized any other.   

17. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to announce the gospel, not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ be made of no effect.

18. For the word of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, it is the power of God.

19. For it has been written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the understanding ones." Isa. 29:14

20. Where is the wise? Where the scribe? Where the lawyer of this world? Did God not make the wisdom of this world foolish?

21. For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save the ones believing.

22. And since Jews ask for a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,

23. we on the other hand preach Christ crucified (truly an offense to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks),

24. but to the called-out ones, both to Jews and to Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God;

25. because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.

26. For you see your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, nor many powerful, not many wellborn.

27. But God chose the foolish things of the world that the wise might be put to shame, and God chose the weak things of the world so that He might put to shame the strong things.

28. And God chose the low-born of the world, and the despised, and the things that are not, so that He might bring to nothing the things that are,

29. so that no flesh might glory in His presence.

30. But of Him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, both righteousness and sanctification and redemption,

31. so that even as it has been written, "He that glories, let him glory in" the "Lord." Jer. 9:24  

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with excellency of word or wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.

2. For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and Him having been crucified.

3. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

4. And my word and my preaching was not in moving words of human wisdom, but in proof of the Spirit and of power,

5. that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.   

6. But we speak wisdom among the perfect, but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, those being brought to nothing.

7. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God predetermined before the ages for our glory,

8. which none of the rulers of this age has known. For if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;

9. according as it has been written, "Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard," nor has it risen up into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those that love Him. Isa. 64:4

10. But God revealed them to us by His Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.

11. For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of a man within him? So also no one has known the things of God except the Spirit of God.

12. But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.

13. Which things we also speak, not in words taught in human wisdom, but in words taught of the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .

14. But a natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to know them , because they are spiritually discerned.

15. But the spiritual one discerns all things, but he is discerned by no one.

16. For "who has known the mind of the Lord?" "Who will teach Him?" But we have the mind of Christ. Isa. 40:13  

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And, brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly ones, as to babes in Christ.

2. I gave you milk to drink, and not food, for you were not then able, but neither now are you yet able.

3. For you are yet fleshly. For where among you is jealousy, and strife, and divisions, are you not fleshly and walk according to man?

4. For when one may say, Truly I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos; are you not fleshly?   

5. What then is Paul? And what Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave?

6. I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.

7. So as neither he planting is anything, nor he watering, but God making to grow.

8. So he planting and he watering are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.

9. For we are fellow workers of God, a field of God, and you are a building of God.

10. According to God's grace given to me, as a wise master builder, I laid a foundation, but another builds on it . But let each one be careful how he builds.   

11. For no one is able to lay any other foundation beside the One having been laid, who is Jesus Christ.

12. And if anyone builds on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,

13. the work of each will be revealed; for the Day will make it known, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire will prove the work of each, what sort it is.

14. If the work of anyone which he built remains, he will receive a reward.

15. If the work of anyone shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss; but he will be saved, but so as through fire.   

16. Do you not know that you are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?

17. If anyone corrupts the sanctuary of God, God will bring that one to corruption; for the sanctuary of God is holy, which you are.   

18. Let no one deceive himself, if anyone thinks to be wise among you in this age, let him become foolish, that he may become wise.

19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it has been written, "He takes the wise in their own craftiness." Job 5:13

20. And again, " The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are worthless." LXX-Psa. 93:11; MT-Psa. 94:11   

21. So let no one glory in men; for all things are yours,

22. whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,

23. and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.  

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. Let a man think of us as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.

2. And the rest, it is sought among stewards that one be found faithful.

3. But to me it is a small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a man's day. But neither do I judge myself.

4. For I know nothing of myself, but I have not been justified by this; but He judging me is the Lord.

5. Then do not judge anything before time, until the Lord comes, who will both shed light on the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of the hearts. And then praise will be to each one from God.

6. And, brothers, I transferred these things to myself and Apollos because of you, that in us you may learn not to think above what has been written, that you not be puffed up one over the other.   

7. For who makes you to differ? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it , why do you boast as if you did not receive?

8. You are already satisfied; you already became rich; you reigned without us (and oh that you really did reign, so that we also might reign with you!)

9. For I think that God set us out last, the apostles, as appointed to death, because we became a spectacle to the world, even to angels and to men.

10. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we not honored.

11. Until the present hour we also hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander homeless,

12. and labor, working with our own hands. Being cursed, we bless; persecuted, we bear;

13. defamed, we entreat. we have become as filth of the world, dirt wiped off by all until now.   

14. I do not write these things shaming you, but warning you as my beloved children.

15. For if you should have myriads of teachers in Christ, yet not many fathers; for I fathered you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.

16. Because of this, I urge you, be imitators of me.   

17. Because of this I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.

18. As to my not coming to you now, some were puffed up.

19. But if the Lord wills, I will come to you shortly. And I will not know the word of those who have been puffed up, but the power.

20. For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

21. What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?  

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. Everywhere it is heard that fornication is among you, and such fornication which is not named among the heathen, so as one to have his father's wife.

2. And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that did this deed might be taken from your midst.

3. For as being absent in body, but being present in spirit, I have already judged the one who has worked out this thing, as if I were present:

4. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together with my spirit also, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

5. to deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6. Your boast is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens all the lump?   

7. Then purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us.

8. So let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and of evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.   

9. I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with fornicators;

10. and not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or with plunderers, or with idolaters, since then you must go out of the world.

11. But now I wrote to you not to associate intimately; if anyone is called a brother and is either a fornicator, or a covetous one, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a plunderer, with such a one not to eat.

12. For what is it to me also to judge the ones outside? Do you not judge those inside?

13. But God will judge the ones outside. "And you shall put out the evil one from you." Deut. 17:7  

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Does anyone of you having a matter against another dare to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints?

2. Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of small judgments?

3. Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to speak of this life?

4. If, then, you truly have judgments of this life, those being least esteemed in the church, you sit these.

5. For I speak shame to you. So, is there not a wise one among you, not even one who will be able to give judgment on his brother in your midst?

6. But brother is judged with brother, and this before unbelievers!

7. Indeed, then, there is already a failure with you all, that you have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not instead be wronged? Why not instead be defrauded?

8. But you do wrong, and defraud, and these things to brothers!   

9. Or do you not know that unjust ones will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals,

10. nor thieves, nor covetous ones, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor plunderers shall inherit the kingdom of God.

11. And some were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.   

12. All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be ruled by any.

13. Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will destroy both this and these. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

14. And God both raised up the Lord, and He will raise us up through His power.

15. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Then taking the members of Christ, shall I make them members of a harlot? Let it not be!

16. Or do you not know that he being joined to a harlot is one body? For He says, "The two shall be into one flesh." Gen. 2:24

17. But he being joined to the Lord is one spirit.

18. Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he doing fornication sins against his own body.

19. Or do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God, and you are not of yourselves?

20. You were bought with a price; then glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are of God.  

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. But concerning what you wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman;

2. but because of fornication, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.

3. Let the husband give due kindness to the wife, and likewise the wife also to the husband.

4. The wife does not have authority of her own body, but the husband. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife.

5. Do not deprive one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer. And come together again on the same place , that Satan may not tempt you through your incontinence.

6. But I say this by permission, not by command.

7. But I desire all men also to be as myself. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, and one that way.

8. But I say to the unmarried men, and to the widows, it is good for them if they also remain as I.

9. But if they do not have self control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be inflamed.   

10. But I command the ones being married (not I, but the Lord), a woman not to be separated from her husband;

11. but if indeed she is separated, remain unmarried, or be reconciled to the husband; and a husband not to leave his wife.

12. But to the rest I say, not the Lord, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, let him not leave her.

13. And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, let her not leave him.

14. For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the husband; else, then, your children are unclean, but now they are holy.

15. But if the unbelieving one separates, let them be separated; the brother or the sister is not in bondage in such matters; but God has called us in peace.

16. For what do you know, wife, whether you will save the husband? Or what do you know, husband, whether you will save the wife?   

17. Only as God has divided to each, each as the Lord has called, so let him walk. So I command in the churches.

18.  Was anyone called having been circumcised? Do not be uncircumcised. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? Do not be circumcised.

19. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of God's commands.

20. Each one in the calling in which he was called, in this remain.

21. Were you called as a slave? It does not matter to you. But if you are able to be free, rather use it .

22. For the one called a slave in the Lord is a freed man of the Lord. And likewise, the one called a free man is a slave of Christ.

23. You were redeemed with a price; do not become slaves of men.

24. Each in whatever state called, brothers, in this remain with God.   

25. But about virgins, I have no command of the Lord. But I give judgment, as having received mercy by the Lord to be faithful.

26. Then I think this to be good, because of the present necessity: that it is good for a man to be thus.

27. Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

28. But if you also marry, you do not sin. And if the virgin marries, she does not sin. But such will have trouble in the flesh. But I am sparing you.

29. But I say this, brothers, that the time has been cut short. For the rest is, that even the ones having wives should be as not having,

30. and those weeping as not weeping, and those rejoicing as not rejoicing, and those buying as not possessing,

31. and those using this world as not abusing it ; for the mode of this world is passing away.

32. But I desire you to be without care. The unmarried one cares for the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord;

33. but the one marrying cares for the things of the world, how to please the wife.

34. The wife and the virgin are different. The unmarried one cares for the things of the Lord, that she be holy in both body and spirit. But the married one cares for the things of the world, how to please the husband.

35. And I say this for your advantage, not that I put a snare before you, but for the fitting thing, and waiting on the Lord without distraction.   

36. But if anyone thinks it behaving indecently toward his virginity (if he is beyond his prime, and so it ought to be), let him do what he desires; he does not sin; let them marry.

37. But he who stands firm in heart, not having necessity, but has authority as to his own will, and has judged this in his heart, to keep his virginity; he does well.

38. So that he that gives in marriage does well, and he that does not give in marriage does better.   

39. A wife is bound by law for as long a time as her husband lives; but if her husband sleeps, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord.

40. But she is happier if she remains so, according to my judgment. And I think I also have the Spirit of God.  

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. But concerning the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

2. But if anyone thinks to know anything, he still has known nothing as he ought to know.

3. But if anyone loves God, he has been known by Him.   

4. Then concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.

5. For even if some are called gods, either in the heavens or on the earth; (even as there are many gods, and many lords);

6. but to us is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we by Him.   

7. But the knowledge is not in all; but some being aware of the idol eat as an idolatrous sacrifice until now; and their conscience being weak is defiled.

8. But food will not commend us to God. For neither if we eat do we excel, nor if we do not eat are we behind.

9. But be careful lest this authority of yours become a cause of stumbling to the weak ones.

10. For if anyone sees you, the one having knowledge, sitting in an idol-temple, will not the weak one's conscience be lifted up so as to eat things sacrificed to idols?

11. And on your knowledge the weak brother will fall, he for whom Christ died.

12. And sinning in this way against your brothers, and wounding their conscience, being weak, you sin against Christ.

13. On account of this, if food offends my brother, I will not at all eat flesh forever, so that I do not offend my brother.  

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus Christ? Are you not my work in the Lord?

2. If I am not an apostle to others, yet I am indeed to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.   

3. My defense to those examining me is this:

4. Have we not authority to eat and to drink?

5. Have we not authority to lead about a sister, a wife, as the rest of the apostles also, and Cephas, and the Lord's brothers do ?

6. Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no authority to quit work?

7. Who serves as a soldier at his own wages at any time? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?

8. Do I speak these things according to man, or does not the Law say these things also?

9. For it has been written in the Law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox treading out grain." Deut. 25:4 Is it that it matters to God as to oxen?

10. Or does He say it altogether because of us? It is written because of us, so that the one plowing ought to plow in hope, and the one threshing in hope to partake of hope.

11. If we have sowed spiritual things to you, is it a great thing if we shall reap of your fleshly things?

12. If others have a share of the authority over you, should not rather we? But we did not use this authority, but we endured all things, so that we might not give a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.

13. Do you not know that those who have labored eat of the holy things of the temple? Those attending on the altar partake with the altar.

14. So also the Lord ordained those announcing the gospel to live from the gospel.   

15. But I have not used one of these. And I do not write these things that it be so with me. For it is good to me rather to die than that anyone nullify my glorying.

16. For if I announce the gospel, no glory is to me; for necessity is laid on me, and it is woe to me if I do not announce the gospel.

17. For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I am entrusted with a stewardship.

18. What then is my reward? That announcing the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ free, so as not to use fully my authority in the gospel.   

19. For being free of all, I enslaved myself to all, that I might gain the more.

20. And I became as a Jew to the Jews, that I might gain Jews; to those under Law as under Law, that I might gain those under Law;

21. to those without Law as without Law (not being without law of God, but under the law of Christ), that I might gain those without Law.

22. I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak. To all I have become all things, that in any and every way I might save some.

23. And I do this for the gospel, that I might become a fellow partaker of it.   

24. Do you not know that those running in a stadium indeed all run, but one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain.

25. But everyone striving controls himself in all things. Then those truly that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.

26. So I run accordingly, as not uncertainly; so I fight, as not beating air;

27. but I buffet my body and lead it captive, lest proclaiming to others I myself might be rejected.  

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. And I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the Sea.

2. And all were baptized to Moses in the cloud, and in the Sea,

3. and all ate the same spiritual food.

4. And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual rock following, and that Rock was Christ.

5. Yet God was not pleased with most of them, "for they were scattered in the deserted place." Num. 14:16   

6. But these things became examples for us, so that we may not be lusters after evil, even as those indeed lusted.

7. Neither be idolaters, even as some of them, as it has been written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play." Ex. 32:6

8. Nor should we commit fornication, as some of them fornicated, and twenty three thousand fell in one day.

9. Neither over-tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents.

10. Neither should you murmur, as also some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.

11. And all these things happened to those as examples, and it was written for our warning, on whom the ends of the ages have come.

12. So that he that thinks to stand, let him be careful that he not fall.

13. No temptation has taken you except what is human; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able. But with the temptation, He will also make the way out, so that you may be able to bear it .

14. On account of this, flee from idolatry, my beloved.   

15. I speak as to prudent ones; you judge what I say.

16. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a partaking of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a partaking of the body of Christ?

17. Because we, the many, are one bread, one body, for we all partake of the one bread.

18. Look at Israel according to flesh; are not those eating the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

19. What then do I say, that an idol is anything, or that an idolatrous sacrifice is anything?

20. But the things the nations sacrifice, " they sacrifice to demons, and not to God." Deut. 32:17 But I do not want you to become sharers of demons;

21. you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and a cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and a table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He? Deut. 32:21   

23. All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful to me, but not all things build up.

24. Let no one seek the things of himself, but each one that of the other.

25. Eat everything being sold in a meat market, examining nothing because of conscience,

26. for "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it." Psa. 24:1

27. And if any of the unbelievers invite you, and you desire to go, eat everything set before you, examining nothing because of conscience.

28. But if anyone tells you, This is slain in sacrifice to idols, do not eat, because of that one pointing it out, and the conscience; for "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it." Psa. 24:1

29. But I say conscience, not that of himself, but that of the other. For why is my freedom judged by another's conscience?

30. But if I partake by grace, why am I evil spoken of because of what I give thanks for ?

31. Then whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all things to the glory of God.

32. Be without offense both to Jews and Greeks, and to the church of God.

33. Even as I also please all in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, that they may be saved.  

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be imitators of me, as I also of Christ.

2. But I praise you, brothers, that in all things you have remembered me, and even as I delivered to you, you hold fast the doctrines.

3. But I want you to know that Christ is the Head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.

4. Every man praying or prophesying, having anything down over his head shames his Head.

5. And every woman praying or prophesying with the head unveiled dishonors her head, for it is the same as being shaved.

6. For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn, or to be shaved, let her be veiled.

7. For truly a man ought not to have the head covered, being the image and glory of God. But woman is the glory of man;

8. for man is not of the woman, but woman of man;

9. for also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man;

10. because of this, the woman ought to have authority on the head, because of the angels.

11. However, man is not apart from woman, nor woman apart from man, in the Lord.

12. For as the woman is out of the man, so also the man through the woman; but all things from God.

13. You judge among yourselves: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God unveiled?

14. Or does not nature herself teach you that if a man indeed wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him?

15. But if a woman wears her hair long, it is a glory to her; because the hair has been given to her corresponding to a veil.

16. But if anyone thinks to be contentious, we do not have such a custom, nor the churches of God.   

17. But enjoining this, I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.

18. Indeed, first, I hear divisions to be among you when you come together in the church. And I believe some part.

19. For there must also be heresies among you, so that the approved ones may become revealed among you.

20. Then you coming together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper.

21. For each one takes his own supper first in the eating; and one is hungry, and another drunken.

22. For do you not have houses to eat and to drink? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who have not? What do I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? I do not praise.   

23. For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;

24. and giving thanks, He broke and said, Take, eat; this is My body which is broken on behalf of you; this do in remembrance of Me.

25. In the same way the cup also, after supping, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood; as often as you drink, do this in remembrance of Me. See Luke 22:19, 20

26. For as often as you may eat this bread, and drink this cup, you solemnly proclaim the death of the Lord, until He shall come.

27. So that whoever should eat this bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, that one will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and let him drink of the cup;

29. for he eating and drinking unworthily eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.

30. For this reason many among you are weak and feeble, and many sleep.

31. For if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.

32. But being judged, we are corrected by the Lord, that we not be condemned with the world.

33. So that, my brothers, coming together to eat, wait for one another.

34. But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the other things I will set in order whenever I come.  

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. But concerning the spiritual things, brothers, I do not wish you to be ignorant.

2. You know that being led away, you nations were led to dumb idols.

3. Because of this I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, Jesus is a curse. And no one is able to say Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit.

4. And there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit;

5. and there are differences of ministries, yet the same Lord.

6. And there are differences of workings, but the same God is working all things in all.

7. And to each one is given the showing forth of the Spirit to our profit.

8. For through the Spirit is given to one a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;

9. and to another, faith by the same Spirit, and to another, gifts of healing by the same Spirit,

10. and to another, workings of powers, and to another, prophecy, and to another, discerning of spirits, and to another, kinds of languages, and to another, interpretation of languages.

11. But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing separately to each as He wills.   

12. Even as the body is one, and has many members, but all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.

13. For also we all were baptized by one Spirit into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, even all were given to drink into one Spirit.

14. For also the body is not one member, but many.

15. If the foot says, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, on account of this, is it not of the body?

16. And if the ear says, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, on account of this, is it not of the body?

17. If all the body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If all hearing, where the smelling?

18. But now God set the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He desired.

19. But if all was one member, where would the body be ?

20. But now, indeed, many are the members, but one body.

21. And the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you; or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

22. But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.

23. And those of the body we think to be less honorable, to these we put more abundant honor around them . And our unpresentable members have more abundant propriety.

24. But our presentable members have no need. But God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member having need,

25. that there not be division in the body, but that the members might have the same care for one another.

26. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it . If one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it .   

27. And you are Christ's body, and members in part.

28. And God placed some in the church: firstly apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then works of power; then gifts of healing, helps, governings, kinds of languages.

29.  Are all apostles? All prophets? All teachers? All workers of power?

30. Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak languages? Do all interpret?

31. But zealously strive after the better gifts. And yet I show you a way according to excellence:  

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.

2. And if I have prophecies, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.

3. And if I give out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, but I do not have love, I am not profited anything.   

4. Love has patience, is kind; love is not envious; love is not vain, is not puffed up;

5. does not behave indecently, does not pursue its own things, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;

6. does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth.

7.  Love quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.   

8. Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be caused to cease; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be caused to cease.

9. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;

10. but when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.

11. When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I caused to cease the things of the infant.

12. For now we see through a mirror in dimness, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will fully know even as I also was fully known.

13. And now faith, hope, and love, these three things remain; but the greatest of these is love.  

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Pursue love, and seek eagerly the spiritual things, but rather that you may prophesy.

2. For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God, for no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.

3. But the one prophesying to men speaks for building up, and encouragement, and comfort.

4. The one speaking in a tongue builds himself up, but he prophesying builds up a church.

5. And I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy. For the one prophesying is greater than the one speaking in tongues, unless he interpret that the church may receive building up.   

6. But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?

7. Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?

8. For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will get himself ready for war?

9. So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what is being said? For you will be speaking into air.

10. So it may be many kinds of sounds are in the world, and not one is without distinct sound.

11. If, then, I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and he speaking in me a foreigner.

12. So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual things, seek to build up the church that you may abound.

13. So then, the one speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret.

14. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.   

15. What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.

16. Else, if you bless in the spirit, the one occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?

17. For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not built up.

18. I thank my God that I speak more languages than all of you.

19. But in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, that I may also instruct others, than myriads of words in a foreign language.

20. Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice be like infants, and in your minds be mature.   

21. It has been written in the Law, "By other tongues" and "by other lips" "I will speak to this people," "and even so they will not hear" Me, says the Lord." Isa. 28:11, 12

22. So that tongues are not a sign to those believing, but to those not believing. But prophecy is not to those not believing, but to those believing.

23. Then if the whole church comes together, and all speak in languages, and uninstructed ones or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you rave?

24. But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or one not instructed comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.

25. And so the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.   

26. Then what is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, he has a teaching, he has a language, he has a revelation, he has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.

27. If one speaks in a language, let it be by two or three at the most, and in turn, also let one interpret.

28. And if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.

29. And if there are two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others discern.

30. But if a revelation is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.

31. For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged.

32. And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.

33. For God is not God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.   

34. Let your women be silent in the churches, for it is not allowed to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as also the Law says.

35. But if they desire to learn anything, let them question their husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in a church.   

36. Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?

37. If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are a command of the Lord.

38. But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

39. So then, brothers, seek eagerly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages.

40. And let all things be done decently and in order.  

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. But, brothers, I reveal to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you also received, in which you also stand,

2. by which you also are being kept safe, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.

3. For I delivered to you in the first place what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,

4. and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures,

5. and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.

6. Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also fell asleep.

7. Then He was seen by James, then by all the apostles;

8. and last of all, even as if to one born out of time, He was also seen by me.

9. For I am the least of the apostles, who am not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which was toward me has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.

11. Then whether they or I, so we preach, and so you believed.   

12. But if Christ is proclaimed, that He was raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is not a resurrection of the dead?

13. But if there is not a resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.

14. But if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is worthless, and your faith is also worthless.

15. And also we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we witnessed as to God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if then dead ones are not raised.

16. For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised.

17. But if Christ has not been raised, your faith is foolish; you are still in your sins.

18. And then those that fell asleep in Christ were lost.

19. If we only have hope in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable.   

20. But now Christ has been raised from the dead; He became the firstfruit of those having fallen asleep.

21. For since death is through man, also through a Man is a resurrection of the dead;

22. for as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.

23. But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruit, afterward those of Christ at His coming.

24. Then is the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He makes to cease all rule and all authority and power.

25. for it is right for Him to reign until He puts all the enemies under His feet; Psa. 110:1

26.  the last enemy made to cease is death.

27. For "He subjected all things under His feet;" but when He says that all things have been subjected, it is plain that it excepts Him who has subjected all things to Him. Psa. 8:6

28. But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all things in all.

29. Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of the dead?

30. Why are we also in danger every hour?

31. Day by day I die, by your boasting, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.

32. If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what the profit to me if the dead are not raised? ("Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.") Isa. 22:13

33. Do not be led astray; bad companionships ruin good habits.

34. Be righteously awake, and do not sin; for some have ignorance of God. I speak to your shame.   

35. But someone will say, How are the dead raised? And with what body do they come?

36. Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.

37. And what you sow, you do not sow the body that is going to be, but a bare grain, (it may be of wheat, or of some of the rest),

38. and God gives it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its own body.

39. Not every flesh is the same flesh, but one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.

40. And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly is truly different, and that of the earthly different;

41. one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.

42. So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.

43. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.

44. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

45. So also it has been written, "The" first "man", Adam, "became a living soul;" the last Adam a life-giving Spirit. Gen. 2:7

46. But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.

47. The first man was out of earth, earthy. The second Man was the Lord out of Heaven. Gen. 2:7

48. Such the earthy man , such also the earthy ones. And such the heavenly Man , such also the heavenly ones.

49. And as we bore the image of the earthy man , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man .

50. And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.   

51. Behold, I speak a mystery to you: we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed.

52. In a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet; for a trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.

53. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

54. But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that has been written, "Death was swallowed up in victory." Isa. 25:8

55. "O death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?" Hos. 13:14

56. Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;

57. but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!   

58. So that, my beloved brothers, you be firm, immovable, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.  

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. And about the collection for the saints, as I charged the churches of Galatia, so also you do.

2. On the first of a week, let each of you put by himself, storing up whatever he is prospered, that there not be collections then when I come.

3. And when I arrive, whomever you approve through these epistles, I will send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.

4. And if it is suitable for me to go also, they shall go with me.   

5. But I will come to you when I go through Macedonia. For I am going through Macedonia.

6. And possibly I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, that you may set me forward wherever I may go.

7. For I do not desire to see you now in passage, but I am hoping to remain some time with you, if the Lord permits.

8. But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.

9. For a door opened to me, great and effective, and many are opposing.   

10. But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I.

11. Then do not let any despise him, but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brothers.

12. And concerning the brother Apollos, I much urged him that he come to you with the brothers, but it was not altogether his will that he come now. But he will come when he has opportunity.   

13. Watch! Stand fast in the faith! Be men! Be strong!

14. Let all your things be in love.

15. But I exhort you, brothers. You know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia, and they appointed themselves to ministry to the saints.

16.  See that you also may submit to such ones, and to everyone working and laboring with me .

17. And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these supplied your lack.

18. For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Then recognize such ones.   

19. The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla much greet you in the Lord, with the church in their house.

20. The brothers all greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

21. The greeting with my hand, Paul.

22. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be a curse. The Lord comes!

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

24. My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
