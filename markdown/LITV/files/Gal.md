# Galatians

## Galatians 1

1. Paul, an apostle, not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, the One raising Him from the dead,

2. and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.

3. Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,

4. who gave Himself for our sins, so that He might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

5. to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.   

6. I wonder that you are so quickly being transferred from Him having called you by the grace of Christ to another gospel,

7. which is not another; only there are some troubling you and desiring to pervert the gospel of Christ.

8. But even if we, or an angel out of Heaven, should announce a gospel to you beside what we preached to you, let him be accursed.

9. As we have said before, and now I say again, If anyone announces a gospel to you beside what you received, let him be accursed.   

10. For do I now persuade men or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I yet pleased men, I would not be a slave of Christ.

11. And, brothers, I make known to you the gospel preached by me, that it is not according to man.

12. For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it , but by a revelation of Jesus Christ.

13. For you heard my way of life when I was in Judaism, that with surpassing zeal I persecuted the church of God and ravaged it.

14. And I progressed in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being much more a zealot of the traditions of my ancestors.

15. But when God was pleased, "He having separated me from my mother's womb" and having called through His grace, Isa. 49:1

16. to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the nations, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,

17. nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.

18. Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Peter and remained with him fifteen days.

19. But I saw no other of the apostles except James the brother of the Lord.

20. And what I write to you, behold, before God I do not lie.

21. Then I went into the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,

22. but I was not known by face to the churches of Judea in Christ.

23. But only they were hearing that he who was persecuting us then, now proclaims the faith which he then ravaged;

24. and they glorified God in me.  

## Galatians 2

1. Then through fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, also taking Titus with me .

2. And I went up according to revelation. And I put before them the gospel which I proclaim in the nations, but privately to the ones seeming to be pillars, lest I run, or I ran, into vanity.

3. But not even Titus, the one with me, a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.

4. But it was because of those false brothers stealing in, who stole in to spy on our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, they desiring to enslave us,

5. to whom not even for an hour we yielded in subjection, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

6. But from those seeming to be something (of what kind they were then does not matter to me; God does not accept the face of man), for those seeming important conferred nothing to me;

7. but on the contrary, seeing that I have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter to the circumcision,

8. (for He working in Peter to an apostleship of the circumcision, also worked in me to the nations),

9. and knowing the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, those seeming to be pillars, gave right hands of fellowship to Barnabas and to me, that we go to the nations, but they to the circumcision;

10. only that we might remember the poor, which same thing I was eager to do.   

11. But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.

12. For before some came from James, he ate with the nations. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, being afraid of those of the circumcision.

13. And also the rest of the Jews dissembled with him, so as even Barnabas was led away with their dissembling.

14. But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before all, If you being a Jew, live as a non-Jew and not as the Jews, why do you compel the nations to Judaize?

15. We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of the nations,

16. knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but that it is through faith in Jesus Christ (we also believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of law, because all flesh will not be justified by works of law). Psa. 123:2

17. But if seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found to be sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Let it not be!

18. For if I build again these things which I destroyed, I confirm myself as a transgressor.

19. For through law I died to law, that I might live to God.

20. I have been crucified with Christ, and I live; yet no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith toward the Son of God, the One loving me and giving Himself over on my behalf.

21. I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died without cause.  

## Galatians 3

1. O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you not to obey the truth, to whom before your eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed among you, crucified?

2. This only I desire to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of law or by hearing of faith?

3. Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, do you now perfect yourself in the flesh?

4. Did you suffer so much vainly, if indeed it also was vainly?

5. Then He supplying the Spirit to you and working works of power in you, is it by works of law or by hearing of faith?   

6. Even "as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness." Gen 15:6

7. Know, then, that those of faith, these are sons of Abraham.

8. And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel before to Abraham: "All the nations will be blessed" "in you." Gen. 12:3

9. So that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.

10. For as many as are out of works of law, these are under a curse. For it has been written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things having been written in the book of the Law, to do them." Deut. 27:26

11. And that no one is justified by law before God is clear because, "The just shall live by faith." Hab. 2:4

12. But the Law is not of faith, but, "The man doing these things shall live in them." Lev. 18:5

13. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it has been written, "Cursed is everyone having been hung on a tree;" Deut. 21:23

14. that the blessing of Abraham might be to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

15. Brothers, I speak according to man, a covenant having been ratified, even among mankind, no one sets aside or adds to it .

16. But the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his Seed (it does not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, "And to your Seed," which is Christ). Gen. 12:7, 13:15; 17:7, 8; 24:7

17. And I say this, A covenant having been ratified before to Christ by God, the Law coming into being four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it .

18. For if the inheritance is of law, it is no more of promise; but God has given it to Abraham through promise.   

19. Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come, to whom it had been promised, being ordained through angels in a mediator's hand.

20. But the Mediator is not of one, but God is one.

21. Then is the Law against the promises of God? Let it not be! For if a law had been given which had been able to make alive, indeed righteousness would have been out of law.

22. But the Scripture locked up all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the ones believing.

23. But before the coming of faith, we were guarded under law, having been locked up to the faith being about to be revealed.

24. So that the Law has become a trainer of us until Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

25. But faith coming, we are no longer under a trainer;

26. for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.

27. For as many as were baptized into Christ, you put on Christ.

28. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there is no slave nor freeman, there is no male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

29. And if you are of Christ, then you are a seed of Abraham, even heirs according to promise.  

## Galatians 4

1. But I say, Over so long a time the heir is an infant, he being lord of all does not differ from a slave,

2. but is under guardians and housemasters until the term set before by the father.

3. So we also, when we were infants, we were under the elements of the world, being enslaved.

4. But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, having come into being out of a woman, having come under Law,

5. that He might redeem the ones under law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

6. And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba! Father!

7. So that you no more are a slave, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.   

8. But then, indeed, not knowing God, you served as slaves to the ones not by nature being gods.

9. But now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do you turn again to the weak and poor elements to which you desire again to slave anew?

10. You observe days and months and seasons and years.

11. I fear for you, lest somehow I have labored among you in vain.   

12. Brothers, I beg of you, be as I am , because I am as you. You wronged me in nothing.

13. But you know that because of weakness of the flesh, I announced the gospel to you before;

14. and you did not despise my temptation in my flesh nor disdained it , but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.

15. What then was your blessedness? For I testify to you that if you were able, plucking out your eyes, you would have given them to me.

16. So then did I become your enemy speaking truth to you?   

17. They are zealous for you, but not well; but they only desire to shut you out, that you be zealous to them.

18. But it is good to be zealous always in a good thing and not only in my being present with you.   

19. My children, for whom I again travail until Christ should be formed to you,

20. even now I desired to be present with you and to change my voice, for I am in doubt as to you.   

21. Tell me, those desiring to be under Law, do you not hear the Law?

22. For it has been written, Abraham had two sons, one out of the slave woman and one out of the free woman.

23. But, indeed, he of the slave woman has been born according to flesh, and he out of the free woman through the promise,

24. which things are being allegorized, for these are two covenants, one, indeed, from Mount Sinai bringing forth to slavery (which is Hagar,

25. for Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and she slaves with her children),

26. but the Jerusalem from above is free, who is the mother of us all;

27. for it has been written, "Be glad, barren one not bearing; break forth and shout, the one not travailing; for more are the children of the desolate rather than she having the husband." Isa. 54:1

28. But, brothers, we are children of promise according to Isaac.

29. But then, even as he born according to flesh persecuted the one according to Spirit, so also now.

30. But what says the Scripture? "Cast out the slave woman and her son, for in no way shall the son of the slave woman inherit with the son of the free woman ." Gen. 21:10

31. Then, brothers, we are not children of a slave woman but of the free woman.  

## Galatians 5

1. Then stand firm in the freedom with which Christ made us free and do not be held again with a yoke of slavery.

2. Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you are circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.

3. And I testify again to every man being circumcised, that he is a debtor to do all the Law,

4. you who are justified by law are deprived of all effect from Christ, you fell from grace.

5. For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness out of faith.

6. For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any strength, but faith working through love.

7. You were running well; who held you back that you do not obey the truth?

8. The persuasion is not from Him calling you.

9. A little leaven leavens all the lump.

10. I trust as to you in the Lord that you will think nothing else, but that the one troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.

11. But I, brothers, if I proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the offense of the Cross has passed away.

12. I would that the ones causing you to doubt will cut themselves off.   

13. For, brothers, you were called to freedom. Only do not use the freedom for an opening to the flesh. But through love serve one another.

14. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this : "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Lev. 19:18

15. But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you are not consumed by one another.

16. But I say, Walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

17. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another; lest whatever you may will, these things you do.

18. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.

19. Now the works of the flesh are clearly revealed, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lustfulness,

20. idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, fightings, jealousies, angers, rivalries, divisions, heresies,

21. envyings, murders, drunkennesses, wild parties, and things like these; of which I tell you beforehand, as I also said before, that the ones practicing such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

22. But the fruit of the Spirit is: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,

23. meekness, self-control. Against such things there is not a law.

24. But the ones belonging to Christ crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.

25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

26. Let us not become glory seeking ones, provoking one another, envying one another.  

## Galatians 6

1. Brothers, if a man is taken in some fault, you, the spiritual ones, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, that you not also be tempted.

2. Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.

3. For if anyone thinks to be something, he deceives himself, being nothing.

4. But let each one prove his work, and then he alone will have a boast in himself and not as to another.

5. For each one will bear his own load.

6. But let the one being taught in the word share with the one teaching, in all good things.

7. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man may sow, that he also will reap.

8. For the one sowing to his flesh will reap corruption of the flesh. But the one sowing to the Spirit will reap everlasting life from the Spirit.

9. But we should not weaken in doing good, for in due time we shall reap, if we do not faint.

10. So then, as we have time, let us work good toward all, and especially toward the household of the faith.   

11. See in what large letters I write to you with my hand.

12. As many as desire to look well in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.

13. For they themselves having been circumcised do not even keep the Law, but they desire you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.

14. But may it never be for me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any strength nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.

16. And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them and on the Israel of God.

17. For the rest, let no one give troubles to me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
