# 1 John

## 1 John 1

1.  We announce to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld, and what our hands touched, as regards the Word of Life.

2. And the Life was revealed, and we have seen, and we bear witness, and we announce to you the everlasting Life which was with the Father, and was revealed to us.

3. We announce to you what we have seen, and what we have heard, that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.

4. And we write these things to you, that your joy may be full.   

5. And this is the message which we have heard from Him, and we announce to you: God is light, and no darkness is in Him, none!

6. If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and we walk in darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.

7. But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin.   

8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

9. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.  

## 1 John 2

1. My little children, I write these things to you so that you do not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

2. And He is the propitiation relating to our sins, and not relating to ours only, but also relating to all the world.   

3. And by this we know that we have known Him, if we keep His commands.

4. The one saying, I have known Him, and not keeping His commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that one.

5. But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.

6. The one saying to rest in Him ought so to walk himself as that One walked.   

7. Brothers, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.

8. Again I write a new commandment to you which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true Light already shines.

9. The one saying to be in the light, and hating his brother, is in the darkness until now.

10. The one loving his brother rests in the light, and no offense is in him.

11. But the one hating his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness blinded his eyes.   

12. Little children, I write to you because you have been forgiven your sins through His name.

13. Fathers, I write to you because you have known Him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you overcome the evil one. I write to you, young ones, because you have known the Father.

14. Fathers, I have written to you because you have known Him from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.

15. Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,

16. because all that which is in the world: the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

17. And the world is passing away, and its lust. But the one doing the will of God abides forever.   

18. Young ones, it is a last hour, and as you heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have risen up, from which you know that it is a last hour.

19. They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they were of us, they would have remained with us; but they left so that it might be revealed that they all are not of us.   

20. And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.

21. I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because every lie is not of the truth.

22. Who is the liar, except the one denying, saying that Jesus is not the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one denying the Father and the Son.

23. Everyone denying the Son does not have the Father. The one confessing the Son also has the Father.

24. Then what you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will abide both in the Son and in the Father.

25. And this is the promise which He promised us: everlasting life.

26. I wrote these things to you concerning the ones leading you astray.

27. And the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you. But as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and as He taught you, abide in Him.   

28. And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He is revealed we may have confidence, and not be shamed from Him in His coming.

29. If you know that He is righteous, know that everyone doing righteousness has been born of Him.  

## 1 John 3

1. See what manner of love the Father has given us, that we may be called children of God. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.

2. Beloved, now we are the children of God, and it was not yet revealed what we shall be. But we know that if He is revealed, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.

3. And everyone having this hope on Him purifies himself even as that One is pure.   

4. Everyone practicing sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.

5. And you know that He was revealed that He might take away our sins, and sin is not in Him.

6. Everyone remaining in Him does not sin. Everyone sinning has not seen Him, nor known Him.

7. Little children, let no one lead you astray; the one practicing righteousness is righteous, even as that One is righteous.

8. The one practicing sin is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning. For this the Son of God was revealed, that He undo the works of the Devil.

9. Everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, because His seed abides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been born of God.

10. By this the children of God and the children of the Devil are revealed: Everyone not practicing righteousness is not of God; also the one not loving his brother.   

11. Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,

12. not as Cain was of the evil one, and killed his brother. And for what did he kill him? Because his works were evil, but the things of his brother were righteous.

13. Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.   

14. We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers. The one not loving the brother remains in death.

15. Everyone hating the brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have everlasting life abiding in him.

16. By this we have known the love of God , because that One laid down His life for us; and on behalf of the brothers we ought to lay down our lives.

17. Whoever has the means of life of the world, and sees his brother having need, and shuts up his bowels from him, how does the love of God abide in him?

18. My little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.

19. And in this we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts before Him,   

20. that if our heart accuses us, we know that God is greater than our heart and knows all things.

21. Beloved, if our heart does not accuse us, we have confidence with God.

22. And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments, and we do the things pleasing before Him.   

23. And this is His commandment, that we should believe the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as He gave command to us.

24. And the one keeping His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He gave to us.  

## 1 John 4

1. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world.

2. By this know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.

3. And every spirit which does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God; and this is the antichrist which you heard is coming, and now is already in the world.   

4. Little children, you are of God and have overcome them, because He in you is greater than he in the world.

5. They are of the world; because of this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.

6. We are of God; the one knowing God hears us. Whoever is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.   

7. Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been born of God, and knows God.

8. The one who does not love has not known God, because God is love.

9. By this the love of God was revealed in us, because His Son, the Only begotten, God has sent into the world that we might live through Him.

10. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be a propitiation relating to our sins.

11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

12. No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love having been perfected is in us.

13. By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because of His Spirit He has given to us.   

14. And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.

15. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.

16. And we have known and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and the one abiding in love abides in God, and God in him.   

17. By this love has been perfected with us, that we have confidence in the day of judgment, that as He is, we are also in this world.

18. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment; and the one fearing has not been perfected in love.

19. We love Him because He first loved us.

20. If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one not loving his brother whom he has seen, how is he able to love God whom he has not seen?

21. And we have this commandment from Him, that the one who loves God also loves his brother.  

## 1 John 5

1. Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. And everyone who loves Him who begets also loves the one who has been born of Him.

2. By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep His commandments.

3. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not heavy.

4. Because everything having been born of God overcomes the world, and this is the victory overcoming the world, our faith.

5. Who is the one overcoming the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?   

6. This is the One coming through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the One witnessing, because the Spirit is the truth.

7. For there are three bearing witness in Heaven: the Father the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.

8. And there are three who bear witness on the earth: The Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three are to the one.

9. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; because this is the witness of God which He has witnessed about His Son:   

10. The one believing in the Son of God has the witness in himself. The one not believing God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning His Son.

11. And this is the witness: that God gave us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son.

12. The one having the Son has life. The one not having the Son of God does not have life.

13. I wrote these things to you, the ones believing in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have everlasting life, and that you may believe in the name of the Son of God.   

14. And this is the confidence we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.

15. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.

16. If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask; and He shall give life to him, to the ones not sinning unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he should ask about that.

17. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death.   

18. We know that everyone having been born of God does not sin, but the one born of God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.

19. We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in evil.

20. And we know that the Son of God has come, and He has given to us an understanding that we may know the true One , and we are in the true One , in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and the life everlasting.

21. Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.
