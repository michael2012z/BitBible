# Mark

## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,

2. as it has been written in the Prophets, "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You;

3.  the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight." Mal. 3:1; Isa. 40:3

4. John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for remission of sins.

5. And all the Judean country and those of Jerusalem went out to him, and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

6. And John was clothed in camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loin, and eating locusts and wild honey.

7. And he proclaimed, saying, He who comes after me is mightier than I, of whom I am not fit to stoop down to loosen the thong of His sandals.

8. I indeed baptized you in water, but He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.   

9. And it happened in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

10. And going up from the water, immediately He saw the heavens being torn, and the Spirit coming down as a dove upon Him.

11. And there was a voice out of the heavens, You are My Son, the Beloved, in whom I take delight. Psa. 2:7; Gen. 22:2; Isa. 42:1

12. And the Spirit at once drove Him out into the wilderness.

13. And He was there in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts. And the angels ministered to Him.   

14. And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,

15. and saying, The time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draws near. Repent and believe in the gospel.

16. And walking along beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a small net in the sea; for they were fishers.

17. And Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

18. And leaving their nets, they immediately followed Him.

19. And going forward from there a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. And they were in the boat mending the nets.

20. And at once He called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went after Him.

21. And they passed along into Capernaum. And entering into the synagogue, at once He taught on the sabbaths.

22. And they were astonished at His doctrine, for He was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.   

23. And a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue. And he cried out,

24. saying, What is to us and to You, Jesus, Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.

25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him.

26. And the unclean spirit convulsing him, and crying out with a loud voice, he came out of him.

27. And all were astonished, so as to discuss to themselves, saying, What is this? What new teaching is this, that He commands even the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him?

28. And His fame went out at once into all the Galilean neighborhood.   

29. And at once going out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

30. And the mother-in-law of Simon was laid out, stricken by fever. And at once they spoke to Him about her.

31. And coming near, He raised her up, holding her hand. And the fever left her instantly, and she served them.

32. And evening coming, when the sun set, they brought to Him all those having illness and those having been demon-possessed.

33. And the whole city was gathered at the door.

34. And He healed many who had illness of various diseases. And he cast out many demons, and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.

35. And rising up quite early in the night, He went out and went away into a deserted place. And He was praying there.

36. And Simon and those with him searched for Him.

37. And finding Him, they said to Him, All are seeking You.

38. And He said to them, Let us go into the neighboring towns, that I may proclaim there also. For it was for this I came forth.

39. And He was proclaiming in their synagogues in all Galilee, and casting out the demons.   

40. And a leper came to Him, begging Him, and falling on his knees to Him, and saying to Him, If You will, You are able to make me clean.

41. And being moved with pity, reaching out the hand, Jesus touched him, and said to him, I am willing. Be made clean!

42. And He having spoken, instantly the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.

43. And strictly warning him, He at once put him out,

44. and said to him, See, tell no one a thing, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer what Moses directed concerning your cleansing, for a testimony to them.

45. But going out he began to proclaim much, and to spread about the matter, so that He no longer could openly enter into a city. But He was outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from every quarter.  

## Mark 2

1. And again He entered into Capernaum after some days. And it was heard that He was in a house.

2. And at once many were gathered, so as none any longer had room, not even to the door. And He spoke the Word to them.

3. And they came to Him carrying a paralytic, being borne by four.

4. And not being able to draw near to Him, due to the crowd, they unroofed the roof where He was. And digging through, they lowered the cot on which the paralytic was lying.

5. And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven to you.

6. But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,

7. Why does this one speak blasphemies this way? Who is able to forgive sins, except One, God?

8. And instantly knowing in His spirit that they reasoned this way within themselves, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?

9. Which is easier? To say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven to you, or to say, Rise up and take your cot and walk?

10. But that you may know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on the earth, He said to the paralytic,

11. I say to you, Rise up and take up your cot and go to your house.

12. And at once he rose up. And taking his cot, he went out before all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, Never did we see it this way.   

13. And he went out by the sea again. And all the crowd came to Him, and He taught them.

14. And passing on, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. And rising up, he followed Him.

15. And it happened as He reclined in his house, even many tax collectors and sinners reclined with Jesus and His disciples, for they were many. And they followed Him.

16. And the scribes and Pharisees seeing Him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, Why is it that He eats and drinks with the tax collectors and sinners?

17. And hearing, Jesus said to them, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who have illness. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.   

18. And John's disciples, and those of the Pharisees, were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?

19. And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the groom is with them? What time they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.

20. But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.

21. And no one sews a patch of unmilled cloth on an old garment, else it takes away its fullness, the new from the old, and a worse tear occurs.

22. And no one puts new wine into old skins, else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh skins.

23. And it happened, He went along through the grain fields in the sabbaths. And His disciples began to make way, plucking the heads of grain .

24. And the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the sabbaths?

25. And He said to them, Did you never read what David did when he had need and hungered, he and those with him,

26. how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the Loaves of Arrangement, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and he even gave to those being with him?

27. And He said to them, The sabbath came into being for man's sake, not man for the sabbath's sake.

28. So then the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also.  

## Mark 3

1. And again He entered into the synagogue. And there was a man who had a withering of the hand.

2. And they watched Him, whether He will heal him on the sabbaths, that they might accuse Him.

3. And He said to the man who had a withering of the hand, Rise up into the middle.

4. And He said to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbaths, or to do evil? To save a soul, or to kill? But they were silent.

5. And having looked around on them with anger, being greatly grieved over the hardness of their heart, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he stretched out, and his hand was restored sound as the other.

6. And going out, the Pharisees at once took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.

7. And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee and from Judea followed Him,

8. also some from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, also those around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude came to Him, hearing how much He was doing.

9. And He spoke to His disciples that a small boat should stay near to Him because of the crowd, that they might not press upon Him.

10. For He healed many, so that they fell on Him, that they might touch Him, as many as had plagues.

11. And when the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him, and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God!

12. And he warned them very much that they should not reveal Him.   

13. And He went up into the mountain, and He called near whom He desired. And they went to Him.

14. And He made disciples of twelve, that they might be with Him; and that He might send them to proclaim,

15. and to have authority to heal diseases, and to cast out the demons.

16. And He put on Simon the name Peter.

17. And on James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, He put on them the names Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder.

18. Also He appointed Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

19. and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And He came into a house.

20. And again a crowd came together, so as they were not able even to eat bread.

21. And hearing, those with Him went out to take hold of Him; for they said, He is out of wits.   

22. And coming down from Jerusalem, the scribes said, He has Beelzebub; and he casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.

23. And calling them near, He spoke to them in parables, saying , How can Satan cast out Satan?

24. And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

25. And if a house is divided against itself, that house is not able to stand.

26. And if Satan rises upon himself, and has been divided, he is not able to stand, but he has an end.

27. No one is able in any way to plunder the goods of the strong one, entering into his house, unless he first tie up the strong one; and then he will plunder his house.

28. Truly I say to you, All the sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they have blasphemed;

29. but whoever commits blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness to eternity, but is liable to eternal judgment

30. (because they said, He has an unclean spirit).   

31. Then His mother and brothers came. And standing outside, they sent to Him, calling Him.

32. And a crowd sat around Him. And they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers seek You outside.

33. And He answered them, saying, Who is My mother or My brothers?

34. And having looked around on those sitting around Him in a circle, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!

35. For whoever does the will of God, this one is My brother, and My sister, and My mother.  

## Mark 4

1. And again He began to teach by the sea. And a large crowd was gathered to Him, so that He entered into the boat in order to sit in the sea. And all the crowd were on the land toward the sea.

2. And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching:

3. Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.

4. And as he sowed, it happened that one indeed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the heaven came and devoured it.

5. And another fell on the stony place where it did not have much earth. And it sprang up at once, due to not having deepness of earth.

6. And the sun rising, it was scorched. And through not having root, it was dried out.

7. And another fell into the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it; and it did not yield fruit.

8. And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, going up and increasing; and one bore thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.

9. And He said to them, The one having ears to hear, let him hear.

10. And when He was alone, those around Him, with the Twelve, asked Him as to the parable.

11. And He said to them, To you has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to these, those outside, all things are being given in parables,

12. that seeing they may see and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand, lest they should convert, and the sins be forgiven to them. Isa. 6:9, 10

13. And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how will you know all parables?

14. The sower sows the Word.

15. And these are those by the wayside where the Word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes at once and takes away the Word having been sown in their hearts.

16. And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the stony places, who, when they hear the Word, they immediately receive it with joy,

17. yet they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then trouble or persecution having occurred through the Word, immediately they are offended.

18. These are those being sown into the thorns, those hearing the Word,

19. and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts about other things entering in, they choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.

20. And these are those being sown on the good ground, who hear and welcome the Word and bring forth fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.   

21. And He said to them, Does the lamp come that it may be put under the grain measure, or under the bed? Is it not also that it may be put on the lampstand?

22. For not anything is hidden but that it will be revealed, nor anything become covered but that it will come to light.

23. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And He said to them, Be careful what you hear. With what measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and more will be given to you, the ones hearing.

25. For whoever may have, more will be given to him; and the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.

26. And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth,

27. and should sleep, and rise night and day; and the seed should sprout and lengthen of itself, as he does not know.

28. For of itself the earth bears fruit: first greenery, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.

29. And when the fruit yields, immediately he "sends forth the sickle, for the harvest has come." Joel 3:13

30. And He said, To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?

31.  It is like a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown on the earth, it is less than all the seeds of those on the earth.

32. And when it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the plants, and produces great branches, so as to enable the birds of the heaven to roost under its shade.

33. And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them, even as they were able to hear.

34. But He did not speak to them without a parable. And He explained all things to His disciples privately.   

35. And evening having come, He said to them on that day, Let us pass over to the other side.

36. And dismissing the crowd they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other small boats also were with Him.

37. And a great windstorm occurred, and the waves beat into the boat so that it was filled already.

38. And He was on the stern, sleeping on the headrest. And they awakened Him, and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?

39. And being awakened, He rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Silence! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

40. And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How do you not have faith?

41. And they feared a great fear and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?  

## Mark 5

1. And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.

2. And He coming out from the boat, immediately out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit met Him,

3. who had his abode among the tombs; and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains.

4. Because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn by him, and the fetters had been shattered. And no one was able to subdue him.

5. And continually night and day in the hills, and in the tombs, he was crying and cutting himself with stones.

6. And seeing Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed the knee to Him.

7. And crying with a loud voice, he said, What is to me and to You, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me.

8. For He said to him, Unclean spirit, come out of the man!

9. And He asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion, because we are many.

10. And he begged Him very much that He would not send them outside the country.

11. And a great herd of pigs were feeding there near the mountain.

12. And all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.

13. And Jesus immediately allowed them. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered into the pigs. And the herd rushed down the cliff into the sea (and they were about two thousand), and they were choked in the sea.

14. And those who fed the pigs fled, and they told it to the city, and to the fields. And they came out to see what was happening.

15. And they came to Jesus, and stared at the one who had been demon possessed, sitting and being clothed, and being in his senses, the one who had the legion. And they feared.

16. And those seeing it related to them how it happened to the one who had been demon possessed, and about the pigs.

17. And they began to beg Him to depart from their borders.

18. And He having entered into the boat, the former demoniac begged Him, that he be with Him.

19. But Jesus did not allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your own, and announce to them what the Lord has done to you and had mercy on you.

20. And he left and began to proclaim in Decapolis what Jesus did to him. And all marveled.   

21. And Jesus having crossed over in the boat again to the other side, a large crowd gathered upon Him; and He was by the sea.

22. And, behold, one of the synagogue rulers named Jairus came. And seeing Him, he fell at His feet.

23. And he begged Him very much, saying, My daughter is at the last end. I pray that You will come and lay hands on her, that she may be cured and live.

24. And He went with him. And a large crowd followed Him and pressed on Him.

25. And a certain woman being with a flow of blood twelve years,

26. and who had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all things that she had, and gaining nothing, but rather coming to worse,

27. hearing about Jesus, coming in the crowd behind Him , she touched His garment.

28. For she said, If I may but touch His garments, I will be cured.

29. And instantly the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was healed of the plague.

30. And knowing instantly within Himself that power had gone forth out of Him, turning in the crowd, Jesus said, Who touched My garments?

31. And His disciples said to Him, You see the crowd pressing on You, and do You say, Who touched Me?

32. And He looked around to see the one who had done this.

33. And the woman, being afraid and trembling, knowing what had happened on her, she came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.

34. And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be whole from your plague.   

35. As He was speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler saying, Your daughter has died. Why do you still trouble the Teacher?

36. But hearing the word spoken, Jesus said to the synagogue ruler at once, Do not fear, only believe.

37. And He did not allow anyone to go with Him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.

38. And they came into the synagogue ruler's house. And He saw a tumult, and weeping and much wailing.

39. And going in, He said to them, Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child has not died, but is sleeping.

40. And they laughed at Him. But putting all out, He took along the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and passed on into where the child was lying.

41. And taking hold of the child's hand, He said to her, Talitha koumi; which is, being translated, Little girl, I say to you, Rise up!

42. And immediately the little girl rose up and walked. For she was twelve years old . And they were amazed with great amazement.

43. And very much He directed them that no one should know this. And He said to give her something to eat.  

## Mark 6

1. And He went out from there and came to His native place. And His disciples followed Him.

2. And a sabbath occurring, He began to teach in the synagogue. And hearing, many were amazed, saying, From where came these things to this one? And what is the wisdom given to him, that even such works of power come about through his hands?

3. Is this one not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in Him.

4. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his native place, and among the relatives, and in his own house.

5. And He could do no work of power there, except He performed healing on a few infirm ones, laying on His hands.

6. And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around the villages in a circuit, teaching.   

7. And He called the Twelve near and began to send them out two by two. And He gave them authority over the unclean spirits,

8. and charged them that they take nothing in the way, except only a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in the belt;

9. but having tied on sandals, and not putting on two tunics.

10. And He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, remain there until you go out from there.

11. And as many as will not receive you, nor hear from you, having gone out from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to them. Truly I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom or Gomorrah in Judgment Day than for that city.

12. And going out, they proclaimed that men should repent.

13. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil and healed many sick ones.   

14. And Herod the king heard, for His name became publicly known. And he said, John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and because of this the works of power operate in him.

15. Others said, He is Elijah; and others said, He is a prophet or as one of the prophets.

16. But hearing, Herod said, This one is John whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.

17. For having sent, Herod himself had seized John and bound him in the prison, because of Herodias the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.

18. For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother.

19. And Herodias held it against him, and desired to kill him, but was not able.

20. For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a holy and just man, and kept him safe. And hearing him, he did many things, and gladly heard from him.

21. And a suitable day having come, when Herod made a dinner for his great ones on his birthday, also the chiliarchs, and the first ones of Galilee.

22. And the daughter of Herodias herself entering, and dancing, she also pleased Herod and those reclining with him . The king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.

23. And he swore to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give to you, up to half of my kingdom.

24. And going out, she said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

25. And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I desire that at once you give to me the head of John the Baptist on a platter.

26. And becoming deeply grieved, but because of the oaths and those reclining together, the king did not wish to reject her.

27. And the king sending a guardsman at once, he ordered his head to be brought. And going, he beheaded him in the prison,

28. and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.

29. And hearing, his disciples went and took his corpse and placed it in a tomb.   

30. And the apostles gathered to Jesus. And they told Him all things, even what they did and what they taught.

31. And He said to them, You yourselves come apart into a deserted place, and rest a little. For those coming and those going were many, and they did not even have opportunity to eat.

32. And they departed by boat into a deserted place apart.

33. And the crowds saw them going, and many recognized Him. And they ran together on foot there, from all the cities, and came before them, and came together to Him.

34. And going out, Jesus saw a large crowd, and had pity on them, because "they were as sheep having no shepherd." And He began to teach them many things. Num. 27:17; Eze. 34:5

35. And it now becoming a late hour, drawing near to Him, the disciples said, The place is deserted, and it is now a late hour.

36. Send them away, that going away to the surrounding fields and villages they may buy bread for themselves. For they do not have what they may eat.

37. And answering, He said to them, You give them food to eat. And they said to Him, Going, should we buy two hundred denarii of bread and give them to eat?

38. And He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And knowing, they said, Five, and two fish.

39. And He ordered them all to recline, group by group on the green grass.

40. And they sat, group by group, by hundred and by fifty.

41. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to Heaven, He blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to His disciples, that they might set before them. And He divided the two fish to all.

42. And all ate, and were satisfied.

43. And they took up twelve hand baskets full of fragments, also from the fish.

44. And those eating the loaves were about five thousand men.   

45. And at once He constrained His disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before to the other side, to Bethsaida, until He should dismiss the crowd.

46. And taking leave of them, He went away to the mountain to pray.

47. And it becoming evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He alone on the land.

48. And He saw them being distressed in the rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And it was about the fourth watch of the night when He came toward them, walking on the sea. And He willed to go by them.

49. But seeing Him walking on the sea, they thought it to be a ghost. And they cried out.

50. For all saw Him, and were troubled. And immediately He spoke to them and said to them, Have courage. I AM! Do not fear.

51. And He went up to them into the boat, and the wind was cut off. And they were amazed, exceedingly beyond measure within themselves, and marveled.

52. For they did not understand the miracle of the loaves, for their hearts were hardened.

53. And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to shore.

54. And they, coming out of the boat, at once knowing Him,

55. they ran around all that neighborhood. And they began to carry about those having illness on cots to where they heard that He was.

56. And wherever He went into villages or cities or fields, they laid the ailing ones in the markets and begged Him if only they may touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were healed.  

## Mark 7

1. And the Pharisees were assembled to Him, also some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.

2. And seeing some of His disciples eating bread with unclean, that is unwashed hands, they found fault.

3. For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they immerse the hands with the fist, holding the tradition of the elders.

4. And coming from the market, they do not eat without immersing. And there are many other things which they received to hold: dippings of cups, and of utensils, and of copper vessels, and couches.

5. Then the Pharisees and scribes questioned Him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?

6. And answering, He said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, hypocrites; as it has been written: "This people honors Me with the lips, but their heart is far away from Me;

7. and in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." Isa. 29:13

8. For forsaking the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men: dippings of utensils and cups, and many other such like things you do.

9. And He said to them, Do you do well to set aside the commandment of God so that you may keep your tradition?

10. For Moses said, "Honor your father and your mother;" Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16 and, "The one speaking evil of father or mother, let him expire by death." Ex. 21:17

11. But you say, If a man says to his father or mother, Corban, (which is, A gift!) whatever you may profit by me.

12. And you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or mother,

13. making the Word of God of no effect by your tradition which you delivered. And many such like things you do.

14. And calling all the crowd near, He said to them, All hear Me and understand.

15. There is nothing from outside the man, having entered into him, which is able to defile him . But the things going out from him, those are the things defiling the man.

16. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.

17. And when He entered into a house from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him about the parable.

18. And He said to them, Are you also so undiscerning? Do you not perceive that all that enters from the outside into the man is not able to defile him?

19.  This is because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the wastebowl, purging all the foods.

20. And He said, That passing out of the man, it is the thing that defiles the man.

21. For from within, out of the heart of men, pass out the evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

22. thefts, greedy desires, iniquities, deceit, lustful desires, a wicked eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.

23. All these evil things pass out from within and defile the man.   

24. And rising up from there, he went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And entering into the house, He desired no one to know, but He could not be hidden.

25. For hearing about Him, a woman came up, one whose daughter had an unclean spirit. And she fell down at His feet.

26. And the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phenocian by race. And she asked Him, that He would cast out the demon from her daughter.

27. And Jesus said to her, First, allow the children to be satisfied, for it is not good to take the children's bread and to throw it to the dogs.

28. But she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord; for even the dogs under the table eat from the crumbs of the children.

29. And He said to her, Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out from your daughter.

30. And going away to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter was laid on the couch.   

31. And again going out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the borders of Decapolis.

32. And they brought a deaf one to Him, hardly speaking. And they begged Him, that He put His hand on him.

33. And taking him away, apart from the crowd, He put His fingers into his ears; and spitting, He touched his tongue;

34. and looking up into Heaven, He groaned and said to him, Ephphatha! (which is, Be opened!)

35. And instantly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke correctly.

36. And He ordered them that they should tell no one. But as much as He ordered them, much more abundantly they proclaimed.

37. And they were most exceedingly amazed, saying, He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.  

## Mark 8

1. The crowd being very great in those days, and not having anything they may eat, Jesus, calling His disciples near, said to them,

2. I have pity on the crowd because now three days they remain with Me, and they do not have what they may eat.

3. And if I send them away fasting to their house, they will faint in the way, for some of them come from afar.

4. And His disciples answered Him, From where will anyone here be able to satisfy these with loaves in the wilderness?

5. And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.

6. And He ordered the crowd to recline on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, He broke and gave to His disciples, that they might serve. And they served the crowd.

7. And they had a few fish. And blessing, He said for these also to be served.

8. And they ate, and were satisfied. And they took up over and above seven lunch baskets of fragments.

9. And those eating were about four thousand. And He sent them away.   

10. And at once entering into the boat with His disciples, He came into the region of Dalmanutha.

11. And the Pharisees went out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from Heaven, tempting Him.

12. And groaning in His spirit, He said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, As if this generation will be given a sign!

13. And leaving them, again entering into the boat, He went away to the other side.

14. And the disciples forgot to take loaves. And they did not have any with them, except one loaf in the boat.

15. And He charged them, saying, See! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

16. And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.

17. And knowing, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason because you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor realize? Have you still hardened your heart?

18. "Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?" And do you not remember? Jer. 5:21

19. When I broke the five loaves to the five thousand, how many hand baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.

20. And when the seven to the four thousand, how many lunch baskets did you take up with the fillings of fragments? And they said, Seven.

21. And He said to them, How do you not understand?   

22. And He came to Bethsaida. And they carried a blind one to Him, and begged Him that He would touch him.

23. And laying hold of the blind one's hand, He led him forth outside the village. And spitting into his eyes, laying His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.

24. And looking, he said, I see men as trees walking.

25. Then He placed His hands on his eyes again, and made him look up. And he was restored and saw all clearly.

26. And He sent him to his house, saying, You may not go into the village, nor may tell anyone in the village.   

27. And Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea of Philip. And in the way, He questioned His disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say Me to be?

28. And they answered, John the Baptist, and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.

29. And He said to them, And you, whom do you say Me to be? And answering, Peter said to Him, You are the Christ.

30. And He warned them that they may tell no one about Him.

31. And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of man to suffer many things and to be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again.

32. And He spoke the word openly. And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him.

33. But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men.

34. And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take his cross, and let him follow Me.

35. For whoever desires to save his life, he shall lose it. But whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel, that one shall save it.

36. For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, yet damage his soul?

37. Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul?

38. For whoever may be ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father, along with the holy angels.  

## Mark 9

1. And He said to them, Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who in no way shall taste of death until they see the kingdom of God coming in power.

2. And after six days Jesus takes along Peter and James and John, and leads them into a high mount apart, alone. And He was transfigured before them.

3. And His garments became shining, very white like snow, such as a fuller on earth is not able to whiten.

4. And Elijah with Moses was seen by them, and they were speaking with Jesus.

5. And answering, Peter said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and, Let us make three tents, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

6. For he did not know what to say, for they were very fearful.

7. And a cloud was overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My Son," the Beloved; hear Him. Psa. 2:7; Gen. 22:2; Deut. 18:15

8. And suddenly, looking around, they saw no one any longer, but Jesus alone with themselves.

9. And as they were coming down from the mount, He commanded them that they should tell no one what they saw, except when the Son of man should rise from the dead.

10. And they held the word to themselves, debating what it is to rise from the dead.

11. And they asked Him, saying, Do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

12. And answering, He said to them, Indeed, Elijah coming first restores all things. And how it has been written of the Son of man that He suffer many things and be despised!

13. But I say to you, Elijah also has come and they did to him whatever they desired, even as it has been written of him.   

14. And coming to the disciples, He saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.

15. And at once all the crowd seeing Him were greatly amazed. And running up, they greeted Him.

16. And He questioned the scribes, What are you arguing with them?

17. And one answered out of the crowd, saying, Teacher, I brought my son to You, having a dumb spirit.

18. And wherever it seizes him, it dashes him; and he foams and gnashes his teeth. And he wastes away. And I told Your disciples, that they might expel it. And they were not able.

19. And answering them, He said, O unbelieving generation! How long will I be with you? How long shall I endure you? Bring him to Me.

20. And they brought him to Him. And seeing Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him. And falling on the ground, he wallowed, foaming.

21. And He questioned his father, How long a time is it while this has happened to him? And he said, From childhood.

22. And often it threw him both into fire and into water, that it might destroy him. But if You are able to do anything, help us, having pity on us.

23. And Jesus said to him, If you are able to believe, all things are possible to those believing.

24. And immediately crying out, the father of the child said with tears, Lord, I believe! Help my unbelief!

25. And seeing that a crowd is running together, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, Come out from him, and you may no more go into him!

26. And crying out, and convulsing him very much, it came out. And he became as if dead, so as for many to say that he died.

27. But taking hold of his hand, Jesus raised him up, and he stood up.

28. And He entering into a house, His disciples questioned Him privately, Why were we not able to cast it out?

29. And He said to them, This kind can go out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.   

30. And going forth from there, they passed by through Galilee. And He desired that no one know.

31. For He taught His disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And being killed, He will rise up the third day.

32. But they did not know the word, and feared to question Him.

33. And they came to Capernaum. And having come into the house, He questioned them, What were you disputing to yourselves in the way?

34. And they were silent, for they argued with one another in the way as to who was greater.

35. And sitting, He called the Twelve and said to them, If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.

36. And taking a child, He set it in their midst, and having embraced it, He said to them,

37. Whoever receives one of such children on My name receives Me. And whoever receives Me does not receives Me, but the One having sent Me.

38. And John answered Him, saying, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, who does not follow us. And we forbade him, because he does not follow us.

39. But Jesus said, Do not forbid him. For there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name, yet be able to speak evil of Me quickly.

40. For who is not against us is for us.   

41. For whoever gives you a cup of cold water to drink in My name, because you are of Christ, truly I say to you, In no way he will lose his reward.

42. And whoever causes one of these little ones that believe in Me to offend, it is good for him if rather a millstone be laid about his neck, and he be thrown into the sea.

43. And if your hand offend you, cut it off. For it is profitable for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go away into Hell, into the fire that cannot be put out,

44. where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.

45. And if your foot causes you to offend, cut it off, for it is profitable for you to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be thrown into Hell, into the fire that cannot be put out,

46. where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.

47. And if your eye offends you, cast it out. For it is profitable for you to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed, than having two eyes to be thrown into the Hell of fire,

48. "where their worm does not die and the fire is not put out." Isa. 66:24

49. For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.

50. Salt is good, but if the salt becomes saltless, by what will you season? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another.  

## Mark 10

1. And rising up from there, He came into the borders of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And again crowds came together to Him, and as He usually did, He again taught them.

2. And coming near, the Pharisees asked Him if it is lawful for a man to put away a wife, testing Him.

3. But answering, He said to them, What did Moses command you?

4. And they said, Moses allowed "to write a bill of divorce, and to put away." Deut. 24:1

5. And answering, Jesus said to them, With respect to your hardheartedness he wrote this command to you.

6. But from the beginning of creation "God made them male and female." Gen. 1:27

7. "Because of this, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife,

8. and the two shall be one flesh;" so that they no longer are two, but one flesh. Gen. 2:24

9. Therefore, what God yoked together, let not man put apart.

10. And again, in the house His disciples asked Him about the same.

11. And He said to them, Whoever shall puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.

12. And if a woman puts away her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.   

13. And they brought children to Him, that He might touch them. But the disciples rebuked those carrying them .

14. But seeing, Jesus was indignant. And He said to them, Allow the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them. For of such is the kingdom of God.

15. Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a child may in no way enter into it.

16. And having taken them in His arms, laying hands on them, He blessed them.   

17. And He having gone out into the highway, running up and kneeling down to Him, one questioned Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

18. But Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, God.

19. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not commit murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother. Ex. 20:12-16

20. And answering, he said to Him, Teacher, I observed all these from my youth.

21. And looking at him, Jesus loved him, and said to him, One thing is lacking to you. Go, sell what things you have, and give to the poor. And you will have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me, taking up the cross.

22. But being sad at the word, he went away grieving; for he had many possessions.

23. And looking around, Jesus said to His disciples, How hardly those having riches will enter into the kingdom of God!

24. And the disciples were astonished at His words. And answering again, Jesus said to them, Children, how hard it is for those trusting on riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle, than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to themselves, And who is able to be saved?

27. But looking at them, Jesus said, From men it is impossible, but not from God. For all things are possible from God.

28. And Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we left all and followed You.

29. But answering, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no one who forsook house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My sake and the gospel,

30. that will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the coming age, eternal life.

31. But many first shall be last, and the last shall be first.   

32. And they were in the highway, going up to Jerusalem. And Jesus was going before them, and following they were astonished and were afraid. And taking the Twelve again, He began to tell them the things about to happen to Him:

33. Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes. And they will condemn Him to death and will betray Him to the nations.

34. And they will mock Him and will flog Him and will spit at Him, and will kill Him. And on the third day He will rise again.

35. And coming up to Him, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, said, Teacher, we desire that whatever we may ask You would do for us.

36. And He said to them, What do you desire for Me to do for you?

37. And they said to Him, Give us that we may sit one off the right of You and one off the left of You in Your glory.

38. But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with ?

39. And they said to Him, We are able. But Jesus said to them, Indeed you will drink the cup which I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.

40. But to sit off My right and off My left is not Mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.

41. And hearing, the ten began to be indignant about James and John.

42. But having called them near, Jesus said to them, You know that those seeming to rule the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.

43. But it shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.

44. And whoever of you desires to become first, he shall be slave of all.

45. For even the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.   

46. And they came to Jericho. And He and His disciples and a large crowd going out from Jericho, a son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus the blind, sat beside the highway begging.

47. And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and to say, Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!

48. And many warned him that he be quiet. But he much more cried out, Son of David, have mercy on me!

49. And standing still, Jesus said for him to be called. And they called the blind one , saying to him, Be comforted, rise up, He calls you.

50. And throwing away his garment, rising up, he came to Jesus.

51. And answering, Jesus said to him, What do you desire I should do to you? And the blind one said to Him, My Lord, that I may see again.

52. And Jesus said to him, Go, your faith has healed you. And instantly he saw again, and followed Jesus in the highway.  

## Mark 11

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, toward the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,

2. and said to them, Go into the village opposite you. And going into it, at once you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men has sat. Untying it, bring it .

3. And if anyone says to you, Why do you do this? say, The Lord has need of it. And he will at once send it here.

4. And they departed and found the colt tied at the door outside, by the crossway; and they untied it.

5. And some of those standing there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt?

6. And they said to them as Jesus commanded, and they let them go.

7. And they led the colt to Jesus. And they threw their garments on it, and He sat on it.

8. And many spread their garments on the highway, and others were cutting branches from the trees and were spreading them on the highway.

9. And those going before, and those following after, were crying out, saying, Hosanna! "Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord!" Psa. 118:25, 26

10. Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!

11. And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple. And having looked around at all things, the hour already being late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.   

12. And on the morrow, they going out from Bethany, He hungered.

13. And seeing afar off a fig tree having leaves, He went toward it , if perhaps He would find anything on it. And coming on it, He found nothing except leaves, for it was not the season of figs.

14. And answering, Jesus said to it, Let no one eat fruit of you any more forever. And His disciples heard.

15. And they came to Jerusalem. And entering into the temple, Jesus began to throw out those selling and buying in the temple; also He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling the doves.

16. And He did not allow any to carry a vessel through the temple.

17. And He taught, saying to them, Has it not been written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations." "But you have made it a den of robbers."? Isa. 56:7; Jer. 7:11

18. And the scribes and the chief priests heard. And they sought how they might destroy Him, for they feared Him, because all the crowd was astonished at His doctrine.

19. And when evening came, He went outside the city.

20. And passing along early, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.

21. And remembering, Peter said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.

22. And answering, Jesus said to them, Have faith of God.

23. For truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be thrown into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be to him, whatever he says.

24. Therefore I say to you, All things, whatever you ask, praying, believe that you will receive, and it will be to you.

25. And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive it , so that your Father in Heaven may also forgive your sins.

26. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your sins.   

27. And they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him.

28. And they said to Him, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority that you do these things?

29. And answering, Jesus said to them, I will also ask you one thing, and answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:

30. The baptism of John, was it from Heaven, or from men? Answer Me.

31. And they argued to themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?

32. But if we say, From men, they feared the people. For all held that John really was a prophet.

33. And answering, they said to Jesus, We do not know. And answering, Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.  

## Mark 12

1. And He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, and set a fence around it ," and dug a winevat, "and built a tower." And he rented it to vinedressers and went away. Isa. 5:1, 2

2. And at the season, he sent a slave to the vinedressers, that he might receive from the vinedressers the fruit of the vineyard.

3. But taking him, they beat him , and sent him away empty.

4. And again he sent to them another slave; stoning that one, they struck him in the head and sent him away, insulting him.

5. And again, he sent another, and they killed that one; also many others, indeed beating these, and killing these.

6. Yet having one son, his own beloved, then he sent him to them also, last of all , saying, They will have respect for my son.

7. But these vinedressers said to themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours.

8. And taking him , they killed him and threw him outside the vineyard.

9. What, then, will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and will destroy the vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others.

10. Have you not even read this Scripture: The "Stone which the builders rejected, this one became head of the corner;

11. this came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes"? Psa. 118:22, 23

12. And they sought to seize Him, yet feared the crowd. For they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.   

13. And they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him, that they might catch Him in a word.

14. And coming, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and there is not a care to you about anyone, for you do not look to the face of men, but teach on the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

15. Should we give, or should we not give? But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why do you tempt Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see.

16. And they brought one . And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? And they said to Him, Caesar's.

17. And answering, Jesus said to them, Render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God. And they marveled at Him.   

18. And Sadducees came to Him, who say there is no resurrection. And they questioned Him, saying,

19. Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a brother of anyone should die and leave behind a wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother. Deut. 25:5

20. Then there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying, he left no seed.

21. And the second took her, and died, and neither did he leave seed; and the third likewise.

22. And all seven took her and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.

23. Then in the resurrection, when they rise again, of which of them will she be the wife? For the seven had her as wife.

24. And answering, Jesus said to them, Do you not err because of this, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God?

25. For when they rise again from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in Heaven.

26. But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, as God spoke to him at the Bush, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"? Ex. 3:6

27. He is not the God of the dead, but God of the living. Therefore, you greatly err.   

28. And coming up, one of the scribes, hearing them arguing, knowing that He answered them well, he questioned Him, What is the first commandment of all?

29. And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is : "Hear, Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord,

30. and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul" and with all your mind, "and with all your strength." This is the first commandment. Deut. 6:4, 5

31. And the second is like this, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." There is not another commandment greater than these. Lev. 19:18

32. And the scribe said to Him, You say well, Teacher. You have spoken according to truth, "that God is one," Deut. 6:4, 5 and "there is no other besides Him;" Deut. 4:35

33. "and to love Him from all the heart", and from all the understanding, "and from all the soul, and from all the strength;" Deut. 6:4, 5 and "to love one's neighbor as oneself" Lev. 19:18 is more than all the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.

34. And seeing that he answered intelligently, Jesus said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to question Him any more.   

35. And teaching in the temple, answering Jesus said, How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?

36. For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit off My right until I place Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." LXX-Psa. 109:1; MT-Psa. 110:1

37. Then David himself calls Him Lord. And from where is He his son? And the large crowd heard Him gladly.

38. And He said to them in His teaching, Be careful of the scribes, those desiring to walk about in robes, and greetings in the markets,

39. and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief couches in the dinners,

40. those devouring the houses of widows, and for a pretense praying at length. These will receive more abundant judgment.   

41. And sitting down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the crowd threw copper coins into the treasury. And many rich ones threw in much.

42. And coming, one poor widow threw in two lepta (which is a kodrantes).

43. And having called His disciples near, He said to them, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has thrown in more than all of those casting into the treasury.

44. For all threw in out of that abounding to them, but she out of her poverty threw in all, as much as she had, her whole livelihood.  

## Mark 13

1. And as He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, Teacher, Behold! What kind of stones and what kind of buildings!

2. And answering, Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down.

3. And as He was sitting in the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew questioned Him privately:

4. Tell us when these things shall be? And what is the sign when all these things are about to be done?   

5. And answering, Jesus began to say to them, Be careful that no one lead you astray.

6. For many will come in My name, saying, I AM! And they will lead many astray.

7. But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be disturbed, for it must occur; but the end is not yet.

8. For nation will be raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be earthquakes in many places. And there shall be famines and troubles. These things are the beginnings of anguishes.

9. But you yourselves be careful, for they will deliver you up to sanhedrins and to synagogues. You will be beaten, and you will be led before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.

10. And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.

11. But whenever they lead you away, delivering you , do not be anxious beforehand, what you should say, nor meditate. But whatever may be given to you in that hour, speak that. For you are not those speaking, but the Holy Spirit.

12. And a brother will deliver up a brother to death, and a father the child. And children will rise up on parents and will put them to death.

13. And you will be hated by all on account of My name. But the one enduring to the end, that one will be kept safe.   

14. But when you see "the abomination of desolation," the one spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (he reading, let him understand), then let those in Judea flee into the mountains. Dan. 11:31; 12:11

15. And he on the housetop, let him not go down into the house, nor go in to take anything out of his house.

16. And the one in the field, let him not return to the things behind to take his garment.

17. But woe to those with babe in womb, and to those giving suck in those days!

18. And pray that your flight will not be in winter;

19. for there will be affliction in those days, such as has not been the like from the beginning of creation which God created until now, and never will be.

20. And if the Lord had not shortened the days, not any flesh would be saved; but because of the elect whom He chose, He has shortened the days.

21. And then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! Or, Behold, there! You shall not believe.

22. For false christs and false prophets will be raised, and they will give signs and wonders in order to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.

23. But you be careful. Behold, I have foretold you all things.   

24. But in those days, after that affliction, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light;

25. and the stars of the heaven will be falling, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.

26. And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with much power and glory. Dan. 7:13

27. And then He will send His angels and will gather His elect from the four winds, from the end of earth to the end of heaven.   

28. And from the fig tree learn the parable: When its branch becomes tender and puts out leaves, you know the summer is near.

29. So you also, when you see these things happening, know that it is near, at the doors.

30. Truly I say to you, Not at all will this generation pass away until all these things occur.

31. The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words will not at all pass away.

32. But concerning that day and the hour, no one knows, not the angels, those in Heaven, nor the Son, except the Father.

33. Watch! Be wakeful, and pray. For you do not know when the time is.

34. As a man going away, leaving his house, and giving his slaves authority, and to each his work (and he commanded the doorkeeper, that he watch),

35. then you watch, for you do not know when the lord of the house is coming, at evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or early;

36. so that he may not come suddenly and find you sleeping.

37. And what I say to you, I say to all. Watch!  

## Mark 14

1. And it was the Passover, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread after two days. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might get hold of Him by guile, to kill Him .

2. But they said, Not during the Feast, lest there will be a tumult of the people.

3. And He being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined, a woman came, having an alabaster vial of pure, costly ointment of nard. And breaking the alabaster vial, she poured it down His head.

4. And some were being indignant to themselves, and saying, To what has this waste of the ointment occurred?

5. For this could be sold for over three hundred denarii, and to be given to the poor. And they were incensed with her.

6. But Jesus said, Let her alone. Why do you cause her troubles? She worked a good work toward Me.

7. For you have the poor with you always, and when you wish, you can do well toward them. But you do not have Me always.

8. What this one held, she did. She took beforehand to anoint My body for the burial.

9. Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in all the world, what this one did will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.

10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Him to them.

11. And hearing, they rejoiced and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might opportunely betray Him.   

12. And on the first day of the Unleavened Bread , when they killed the passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You desire that going we may prepare that You may eat the passover?

13. And He sent two of His disciples, and said to them, Go into the city. And you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him.

14. And wherever he goes in, say to the housemaster, The Teacher says, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?

15. And he will show you a large upper room, having been spread and made ready. Prepare for us there.

16. And His disciples went out and came into the city and found it as He told them. And they prepared the Passover.

17. And evening having come, He came with the Twelve.

18. And as they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will betray Me, the one eating with Me.

19. And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Not at all I, is it ? And another, Not at all I, is it ?

20. But answering, He said to them, It is one from the Twelve, the one dipping in the dish with Me.

21. Truly the Son of man goes as it has been written concerning Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him if that man had never been born.

22. And as they were eating, Jesus taking a loaf, blessing, He broke and gave to them. And He said, Take, eat, this is My body.

23. And taking the cup, giving thanks, He gave to them. And they all drank out of it.

24. And He said to them, This is My blood, that of the New Covenant, which is poured out concerning many.

25. Truly I say to you, I will not at all drink of the fruit of the vine any more until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

26. And singing a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.

27. And Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended in Me in this night, because it has been written: "I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered." Zech. 13:7

28. But after My resurrection , I will go before you into Galilee.

29. But Peter said to Him, Even if all shall be offended, yet not I.

30. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that today, in this night, before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times.

31. But he said more fervently, If it were needful for me to die with You, in no way will I deny You. And also all said the same.   

32. And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane. And He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.

33. And He took along Peter and James and John with Him. And He began to be much amazed and to be deeply troubled.

34. And He said to them, My soul is deeply grieved, unto death. Remain here and watch.

35. And going forward a little, He fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.

36. And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to You; take this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You will .

37. And He came and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Were you not strong enough to watch one hour?

38. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.

39. And going away again, He prayed, saying the same thing.

40. And returning, He found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him.

41. And He came a third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

42. Rise up, let us go. Behold, the one betraying Me has drawn near.   

43. And at once, as He was yet speaking, Judas came up, being one of the Twelve. And with him was a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

44. And the one betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, it is He; seize Him and lead Him away safely.

45. And coming, at once drawing near to Him, he said, Rabbi, Rabbi! And he ardently kissed Him.

46. And they laid their hands on Him and seized Him.

47. But a certain one of those standing by, drawing a sword, struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.

48. And answering, Jesus said to them, Have you come out with swords and clubs to take Me, as against a robber?

49. I was with you daily teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me. But it is that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.

50. And leaving Him, all fled.

51. And one, a certain young man, was following Him, having thrown a linen cloth about his naked body . And the young men seized him.

52. But forsaking the linen cloth, he fled from them naked.   

53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together to him.

54. And Peter followed Him from a distance, to the inside of the court of the high priest. And he was sitting with the under-officers, also warming himself near the light.

55. And the chief priests and the whole sanhedrin sought testimony against Jesus, to put Him to death. And they found none.

56. For many falsely testified against Him, but the testimonies were not identical.

57. And standing up, some falsely testified against Him, saying,

58. We heard Him saying, I will throw down this temple made with hands, and through three days I will build another not made with hands.

59. And neither in this was their testimony identical.

60. And standing in the middle, the high priest questioned Jesus, saying, Do you not answer? Nothing? What do these testify against you?

61. But He was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him, and said to Him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?

62. And Jesus said, I AM! And you will see the Son of man sitting off the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven. Psa. 110:1; Dan. 7:13

63. And tearing his garments, the high priest said, Why do we still have need of witnesses?

64. You heard the blasphemy. What does it seem to you? And they all condemned Him to be liable, even of death.

65. And some began to spit at Him, and to cover His face, and to beat Him with a fist, and to say to Him, Prophesy! And the under-officers struck Him with slaps.   

66. And Peter being in the court below, one of the high priest's female slaves came.

67. And seeing Peter warming himself, looking at him, she said, And you were with Jesus the Nazarene.

68. But he denied, saying, I do not know nor understand what you say. And he went out into the forecourt. And a cock crowed.

69. And seeing him again, the female slave began to say to those standing by, This one is of them.

70. And again he denied. And after a little, those standing by again said to Peter, Truly you are from them, for you are both a Galilean and your speech agrees.

71. But he began to curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak.

72. And a second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered the word Jesus said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking on it , he wept.  

## Mark 15

1. And immediately in the morning, the chief priests with the elders and scribes and all the sanhedrin forming a council, binding Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.

2. And Pilate questioned Him, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering, He said to him, You say it .

3. And the chief priests urgently accused Him of many things. But He answered nothing.

4. But Pilate again questioned Him, saying, Do you answer nothing? Behold, how many things they testify against you.

5. But Jesus answered nothing any more, so as for Pilate to marvel.

6. And at a feast, he released to them one prisoner, whomever they asked.

7. And there was one called Barabbas, having been bound with the insurgents, who in the insurrection had committed murder.

8. And crying aloud, the crowd began to beg him to do as he always did to them.

9. But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you desire I should release to you the king of the Jews?

10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him up through envy.

11. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, that rather he should release Barabbas to them.

12. But answering again, Pilate said to them, What then do you desire I do to him whom you call king of the Jews?

13. And again they cried out, Crucify him!

14. But Pilate said to them, For what evil did he do? But they much more cried out, Crucify him!   

15. And deciding to do the easiest to the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. And having flogged Him , he delivered up Jesus, that He might be crucified.

16. And the soldiers led Him away inside the court, which is the praetorium. And they called together all the cohort.

17. And they put purple on Him, and they plaited and placed a crown of thorns on Him.

18. And they began to salute Him, Hail, king of the Jews!

19. And they struck His head with a reed, and spat at Him. And placing the knees, they bowed to Him.

20. And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, and put His own garments on Him. And they led Him out, that they might crucify Him.

21. And they forced one passing by, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from a field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry His cross.   

22. And they brought Him to Golgotha Place, which translated is Place of a Skull.

23. And they gave him wine spiced with myrrh to drink. But He did not take it .

24. And crucifying Him, they divided His garments, casting a lot on them, who and what each should take. Psa. 22:18

25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.

26. And the inscription of His charge was written over Him , THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27. And they crucified two robbers with Him, one off the right, and one off the left of Him.

28. And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the lawless." Isa. 53:12

29. And those passing by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha! You razing the temple, and in three days building it ,

30. save yourself and come down from the cross.

31. And also the chief priests and the scribes mocking to one another said the same, He saved others; he is not able to save himself.

32. The Christ, the king of Israel? Let him now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And the ones crucified with Him insulted Him.   

33. And it being the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.

34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? (Which being translated is, "My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?") Psa. 22:1; 69:21

35. And hearing, some of those standing by said, Behold, he calls Elijah.

36. And one running up, and filling a sponge with "vinegar," and putting it on a reed, "gave Him to drink." But they said, Leave alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down. Psa. 69:21

37. And letting out a great cry, Jesus expired.

38. And the veil of the Holy Place was torn into two, from top to bottom.

39. And standing off across from Him, seeing that He had cried out so, and He expired, the centurion said, Truly, this Man was Son of God.

40. And also women were watching from a distance, among whom also was Mary Magdalene; also Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,

41. who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee; and many other women who came up to Jerusalem with Him.   

42. And it becoming evening already, since it was the preparation, that is, the day before sabbath,

43. Joseph of Arimathea came, an honorable councillor, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God. And taking courage, he went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.

44. And Pilate marveled if He had already died. And calling the centurion near, he asked him if He died already.

45. And knowing from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

46. And having bought a linen cloth, and having taken Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb which was cut out of rock. And he rolled a stone against the mouth of the tomb.

47. And Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, saw where He was laid.  

## Mark 16

1. And the sabbath passing, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome, bought spices, so that coming they might anoint Him.

2. And very early on the first of the week, the sun having risen, they came upon the tomb.

3. And they said to themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?

4. And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back; for it was very large.

5. And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, having been clothed in a white robe. And they were much amazed.

6. But He said to them, Do not be amazed. You seek Jesus the Nazarene who has been crucified. He was raised. He is not here. See the place where they put Him?

7. But go, say to the disciples and to Peter, He goes before you into Galilee. You will see Him there, even as He told you.

8. And going out quickly, they fled from the tomb. And trembling and ecstasy took hold of them. And they told no one, not a thing, for they were afraid.   

9. And rising early on the first of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.

10. That one had gone and reported to those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping.

11. And those hearing that He lives, and was seen by her, they did not believe.

12. And after these things, He was revealed in a different form to two of them walking and going into the country.

13. And going, those reported to the rest. Neither did they believe those.   

14. Afterward, as they reclined, He was revealed to the Eleven. And He reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him, having been raised.

15. And He said to them, Going into all the world, preach the gospel to all the creation.

16. The one believing and being baptized will be saved. And the one not believing will be condemned.

17. And signs will follow to those believing these things: they will cast out demons in My name; they will speak new languages;

18. they will take up snakes; and if they drink anything deadly, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.   

19. Then indeed, after speaking to them, the Lord was taken up into Heaven, and sat off the right of God. Psa. 110:1

20. And going out, they preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs following. Amen.
