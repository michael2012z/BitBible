## 1 Kings 1

1. And king David was old, going into days. And they covered him with garments, for he had no heat.

2. And his servants said to him, Let them seek out a young woman for my lord the king, a virgin, and she shall stand before the king, and be a nurse to him, and lie in your bosom, and my lord the king shall have heat.

3. And they sought out a beautiful young woman in all the border of Israel. And they found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her in to the king.

4. And the young woman was exceedingly beautiful, and she was a nurse to the king and served him. But the king did not know her.   

5. And Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will reign. And he prepared a chariot for himself, and horsemen, and fifty men running before his face.

6. And his father had not troubled him all his days, saying, Why have you done so? And he also was very good of form, and one had borne him after Absalom.

7. And his words were with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And they helped, going after Adonijah.

8. But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who were to David, were not with Adonijah.

9. And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings near the Stone of Serpents which is near En-rogel. And he called all his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king.

10. But he did not call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and his brother Solomon.   

11. And Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and our lord David does not know?

12. And now, come, please let me counsel you with counsel, and save your life, and the life of your son Solomon.

13. Go up and go in to king David. And you shall say to him, My lord, O king, have you not sworn to your handmaid, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? And why does Adonijah reign?

14. Behold, while you are speaking with the king, then I will come in after you and will confirm your words.

15. And Bathsheba came in to the king, to the inner room. And the king was old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.

16. And Bathsheba bowed and knelt before the king. And the king said, What shall I do for you?

17. And she said to him, My lord, you have sworn to your handmaid by Jehovah your God, saying , Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.

18. And now, behold, Adonijah reigns. And now, my lord O king, you have not known.

19. And he sacrifices oxen, and fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But he has not called to your servant Solomon.

20. And you, my lord O king, the eyes of Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

21. And it will be, when my lord the king lies with his fathers, that I, my son Solomon and I, shall be offenders.

22. And, behold, she was speaking with the king, and Nathan the prophet came in.

23. And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet! And he came in before the king and bowed to the king on his face to the earth.

24. And Nathan said, My lord O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?

25. For he has gone down today and sacrificed oxen, and fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the army commanders, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they are saying, Let king Adonijah live!

26. But as for me, I, your servant, and for Zadok the priest, and for Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and for your servant Solomon, he has not called.

27. If this thing is to come about from my lord the king, then you have not caused your servant to know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

28. And king David replied and said, Call Bathsheba for me. And she came in before the king, and stood before the king.

29. And the king swore and said, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,

30. surely as I swore to you by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place; surely so I will do this day.

31. And Bathsheba bowed her face to the earth, even bowing to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.   

32. And king David said, Call Zadok the priest for me and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came in before the king.

33. And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and you shall cause my son Solomon to ride on my mule, and cause him to go down to Gihon.

34. And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet shall anoint him there as king over Israel. And you shall blow with the ram's horn and shout, Let king Solomon live!

35. And you shall come up after him, and let him come and sit on my throne, for he shall reign in my place. For I have appointed him ruler over Israel, and over Judah.

36. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen! So says Jehovah the God of my lord the king.

37. As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, so shall He be with Solomon, and shall make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.

38. And Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went out and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and caused him to go to Gihon.

39. And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew with the ram's horn, and all the people shouted, Let king Solomon live!

40. And all the people came up after him. And the people were piping with pipes, and rejoicing with great joy. And the earth was torn with their sound.   

41. And Adonijah heard, and all those invited, who were with him. And they stopped eating. And Joab heard the sound of the ram's horn, and said, What is this noise roaring from the city?

42. And he was still speaking, and, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came in. And Adonijah said, Come in, for you are a mighty man and bear good news.

43. And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord, king David, has caused Solomon to reign.

44. And the king sent Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet with him, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they caused him to ride on the king's mule.

45. And they anointed him, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet, as king in Gihon. And they have come up from there rejoicing. And the city was roaring. It is the noise that you heard.

46. And also Solomon has sat on the throne of the kingdom.

47. And also the king's servants have come in to bless our lord, king David, saying, Your God shall make the name of Solomon better than your name, and his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed.

48. And also the king has said, Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel who has today given one sitting on my throne, and my eyes seeing it.

49. And they trembled and rose up, all those who were invited by Adonijah, and left, each to his way.

50. And Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon, and he rose up and went and lay hold on the horns of the altar.

51. And it was told to Solomon, saying, Adonijah is afraid of king Solomon. And, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me as of today that he will not put his servant to death by the sword.

52. And Solomon said, If he becomes a son of virtue, not a hair of his head shall fall to the earth. But if evil is found in him, then he shall die.

53. And king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came in and bowed to king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, Go to your house.  

## 1 Kings 2

1. And the days of David drew near for him to die. And he commanded his son Solomon, saying,

2. I am going in the way of all the earth. And you be strong, and be a man,

3. and keep the charge of Jehovah your God, to walk in His ways, to keep statutes, His commands, and His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may do wisely all that you do, and there wherever you may turn,

4. so that Jehovah may establish His word which He spoke to me, saying, If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, saying, There shall not be a man to you cut off from the throne of Israel.

5. And also, you know that which Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, that which he did to the two army commanders of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, that he murdered them, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle, on his loins and in his sandals on his feet;

6. and you shall do according to your wisdom, and shall not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace.

7. You shall be merciful to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and they shall be among those eating at your table, for so they drew near to me when I fled from the face of your brother Absalom.

8. And, behold, with you is Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim. And he cursed me with a grievous cursing in the day I went to Mahanaim. And he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah, saying, I shall not put you to death by the sword.

9. And now, do not acquit him, for you are a wise man, and you know that which you shall do to him and shall bring his old age down with blood to Sheol.

10. And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.

11. And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty three years in Jerusalem.   

12. And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.

13. And Adonijah the son of Haggith came in to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do you come in peace? And he said, Peace.

14. And he said, A word to you and to me? And she said, Speak.

15. And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces toward me to reign. Yet the kingdom has been turned around and is my brother's, because it was his from Jehovah.

16. And now I am asking one petition of you. Do not turn away your face. And she said to him, Speak.

17. And he said, Please speak to king Solomon, for he will not turn away your face, that he give to me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.

18. And Bathsheba said, Well! I will speak to the king for you.

19. And Bathsheba came in to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat on his throne, and placed a throne for the king's mother. And she sat at his right hand.

20. And she said, I ask one small petition of you. Do not turn away my face. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not turn away your face.

21. And she said, let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah for a wife.

22. And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Also ask the kingdom for him, for he is my older brother; yea, for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

23. And king Solomon swore by Jehovah, saying, So shall God do to me, and so shall He do more, if not Adonijah has not spoken this word against his life.

24. And now, as Jehovah lives, who has established me and caused me to sit on the throne of my father David, and who has made a house for me, as He spoke, surely today Adonijah shall be put to death.

25. And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he fell on him, and he died.   

26. And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to your fields. For you are deserving of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you have borne the ark of the Lord Jehovah before my father David, and because you were afflicted in all the things with which my father was afflicted.

27. And Solomon drove Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to fulfill the word of Jehovah which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

28. And the report came to Joab, for Joab had turned aside after Adonijah though he did not turn aside after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of Jehovah, and lay hold on the horns of the altar.

29. And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of Jehovah, and, behold, he was by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.

30. And Benaiah came into the tabernacle of Jehovah and said to him, So says the king, Come out. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, So says Joab. Yea, so he answered me.

31. And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him, and turn aside the innocent blood which Joab shed, off of me and off of my father's house.

32. And Jehovah shall turn back his blood on his own head, who has fallen on two men more righteous and better than he, and murdered them with the sword; and my father David not knowing: Abner the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah.

33. Yea, He shall turn back their blood on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever. And as for David and for his seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there shall be peace forever from Jehovah.

34. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell on him, and executed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.   

35. And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army. And the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.

36. And the king sent and called Shimei and said to him, Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there anywhere.

37. And it shall be, in the day you go out and cross the torrent Kidron, you shall certainly know that dying you shall die; your blood shall be on your head.

38. And Shimei said to the king, The word is good. As my lord the king has spoken, so your servant shall do. And Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.

39. And it happened at the end of three years, two of Shimei's servants fled to Achish the son of Maachah, the king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.

40. And Shimei rose up and saddled his ass and went to Gath, to Achish, to seek his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.

41. And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.

42. And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not cause you to swear by Jehovah, and testify to you, saying, In the day you go out, and you have gone anywhere, you certainly shall know that you shall surely die. And you said to me, The word I have heard is good.

43. And why have you not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the charge that I commanded you?

44. And the king said to Shimei, You shall know all the evil that your heart has known, that which you did to my father David. Now Jehovah has turned back your evil on your head.

45. And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah forever.

46. And the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell on him, and he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.  

## 1 Kings 3

1. And Solomon made an alliance by marriage with Pharaoh the king of Egypt. And he took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David, until he finished building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.

2. Only, the people were sacrificing in high places, for a house for the name of Jehovah had not been built until those days.

3. And Solomon loved Jehovah, to walk in the statutes of his father David. Only, he was sacrificing in high places and burning incense.

4. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for it was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.   

5. Jehovah appeared to Solomon in Gibeon in a dream of the night. And God said, Ask. What shall I give to you?

6. And Solomon said, You have shown great kindness to Your servant, my father David, as he walked before You in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with You. And You have kept for him this great kindness, and have given to him a son sitting on his throne, as today.

7. And now, O Jehovah my God, You have caused Your servant to reign instead of my father David. And I am a little man-child; I do not know to go out and to come in.

8. And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a numerous people that cannot be numbered or counted for multitude.

9. Also give to Your servant an understanding heart, to judge Your people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this, Your great people?

10. And the word was good in the eyes of the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.

11. And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself many days, nor asked riches for yourself, nor asked the life of your enemies, and have asked for discernment for yourself, to understand judgment,

12. behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given to you a wise and understanding heart, so that there was none like you before you, and after you none shall rise up like you.

13. And also, I have given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, that there shall not be a man like you among the kings all your days.

14. And if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commands, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days.

15. And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream! And he came into Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings, and made peace offerings. And he made a banquet for all his servants.   

16. Then two women, harlots, came in to the king and stood before him.

17. And the one woman said, O my lord, this woman and I were living in one house. And I gave birth, with her in the house.

18. And it happened on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were together; no stranger was with us in the house, only we two in the house.

19. And the son of this woman died at night, because she laid on it.

20. And she rose up in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me and laid it in her bosom; and your handmaid was asleep. And she laid her dead son in my bosom.

21. And I rose up in the morning to suckle my son; and behold! It was dead. And I looked at it in the morning; and, behold, it was not my son whom I had borne.

22. And the other woman said, No, but my son is the living, and your son the dead. And this one said, No, but your son is dead, and my son the living. And they spoke before the king.

23. And the king said, This one says, This is my son, the living one, and your son the dead. And that one says, No, but your son is the dead, and my son the living.

24. And the king said, Bring a sword to me. And they brought the sword before the king.

25. And the king said, Divide the living child into two, and give the half to the one, and the half to the other.

26. And the woman whose son was the living one said to the king (for her womb yearned over her son) yea, she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and do not at all put it to death. And this one said, Let it be neither yours or mine, divide it .

27. And the king answered and said, Give to her the living child, and do not put it to death at all; she is its mother.

28. And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had judged, and feared from the face of the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.

19. And he prepared the Holy of Holies in the middle of the house, to place the ark of the covenant of Jehovah there.

20. And the face of the Holy of Holies was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in height. And he overlaid it with refined gold, and overlaid the altar with cedar.

21. And Solomon overlaid the house inside with refined gold, and caused it to pass over in chains of gold to the face of the Holy of Holies, and overlaid it with gold.

22. And he overlaid all of the house with gold, until all of the house was complete. And he overlaid with gold all of the altar that belonged to the Holy of Holies.

23. And inside the Holy of Holies he made two cherubs of the olive tree; their height was ten cubits.

24. And one wing of the cherub was five cubits; and the second wing of the cherub five cubits; ten cubits from the ends of its wings even to the ends of its wings.

25. And the second cherub was ten cubits; one measure and one form to the two cherubs.

26. The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the second cherub.

27. And he set the cherubs in the middle of the inner house. And they spread out the wings of the cherubs. And the wing of the one touched the wall; and the wing of the second touched the second wall; and their wings were to the middle of the house, coming wing against wing.

28. And he overlaid the cherubs with gold.

29. And all the walls of the house all around he carved with figures of cherubs and palm trees, and spread out flowers inside and out.

30. And he overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inside and out.

31. As to the entrance of the Holy of Holies, he made doors of the olive tree; the lintel, the side posts, being a fifty part.

32. And the two doors were of olive wood. And he carved on them carvings of cherubs, and palm trees, and spread out flowers; and he overlaid them with gold. And he caused the gold to go down on the cherubs and on the palm trees.

33. So also he made side post for the entrance of the temple from the olive tree, a fourth part.

34. And the two doors were of fir wood; the two sides of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.

35. And he carved cherubs, and palm trees, and spread out flowers, and overlaid them with gold fitted on the carved work.

36. And he built the inner court, three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.

37. The house of Jehovah was founded in the fourth year, in the month of Zif.

38. And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, the eighth month, the house was finished as to all its parts, and according to all its plans. So he built it for seven years.  

## 1 Kings 7

1. And Solomon built his own house for thirteen years. And he finished all his house.

2. And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits on four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar beams on the pillars.

3. And it was covered with cedar above, on the sides that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.

4. And windows were in three rows, and light was against light in three rows.

5. And all the doors and the side posts were square along with the windows; and the front of a window was against a window in three rows.

6. And he made the porch of the pillars, its length fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. And the porch was before them; and the pillars and the roof were over them.

7. And he made the porch of the throne where he judged, the porch of judgment. And it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.

8. As to his house where he lived, the other court was within the porch, as this work was. Solomon also made a house for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken, like this porch.

9. And these were of costly stone according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with a saw, inside and out, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside, to the great court.

10. And the foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.

11. And above were costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stone and cedar.

12. And the great court all around was three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams, even for the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and for the porch of the house.   

13. And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.

14. He was the son of a widow woman of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father a man of Tyre, an engraver in bronze. And he was filled with the wisdom and understanding and knowledge to do all work in bronze. And he came to king Solomon and did all his work.

15. And he formed the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits went around the second pillar.

16. And he made two capitals to put on the tops of the pillars, cast in bronze; five cubits was the height of the one capital, and five cubits the height of the second capital.

17.  He made lattices, net work with twisted threads of chain-work, for the capitals on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.

18. And he made the pillars. And two rows were all around on the one lattice, to cover the capitals on the top with the pomegranates. And so he did for the other capital.

19. And the capitals on the top of the pillars in the porch were lily-work, four cubits.

20. And the capitals were on the two pillars, also above, over against the belly which was by the lattice; and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows all around on the other capital.

21. And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple. And he set up the right pillar and called its name Jachin. And he set up the left pillar, and called its name of Boaz.

22. And on the top of the pillars was lily-work. So the work of the pillars was finished.

23. And he made a casted sea of ten cubits from brim to brim; it was round all about. And its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits went around it all about.

24. And gourds were below its brim all around, going around it, ten by the cubit, circling the sea all around; the gourds were cast in two rows when it was cast.

25. It stood on twelve oxen: three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east. And the sea was above on them; and all their hinder parts were inward.

26. And its thickness was one hand wide; and its brim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, with a bud of a lily. It contained two thousand baths.

27. And he made ten bases of bronze; four cubits the length of the one base, and four cubits the breadth, and three cubits the height.

28. And this was the work of the base: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays.

29. And on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubs. And a pedestal was on the stays above. And below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.

30. And the one base had four wheels of bronze, and axles of bronze. And its four feet were supports to them; under the basin were casted supports with wreaths at each side.

31. And its mouth within and above the capital was a cubit; and its mouth was round like the work of a pedestal, a cubit and half of the cubit. And also on its mouth were carvings; and their borders were square, not round.

32. And the four wheels were under the borders. And the hands of the wheels were in the base; and the height of the one wheel was a cubit and a half.

33. And the work of the wheels was as the work of a chariot wheel, their hands, and their rims, and their spokes, and their hubs were all casted.

34. And there were four supports to the four corners of one base; the supports were of the base itself.

35. And in the top of the base was a round compass of half a cubit high. And on the top of the base its sides and its borders were from it.

36. And he engraved cherubs, lions, and palm trees on the plates of its sides, and on its borders, as the place of each, with wreaths all around.

37. So he made the ten bases, one casting, one measure, one form was to them all.

38. And he made ten basins of bronze; the one basin contained forty baths. The one basin was four cubits, one basin on the one base, to the ten bases.

39. And he put the five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. And he put the sea on the right side of the house, eastward, across from the south.

40. And Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the bowls. And Hiram finished all the work that he made for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah:

41. two pillars, and two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two gratings to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;

42. and the four hundred pomegranates for the two gratings, two rows of pomegranates for each grating, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;

43. and ten bases, and ten basins on the bases;

44. and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

45. and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And all these vessels which Hiram made for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah were of burnished bronze.

46. The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the thick soil of the ground between Succoth and Zarethan.

47. And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were very, very many; the weight of the bronze was not searched out.   

48. And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold; and the table of gold on which was the Bread of the Presence;

49. and the lampstands, five on the right and five on the left before the Holy of Holies, of refined gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs were of gold;

50. and the basins, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the firepans were of refined gold; and the hinges for the doors of the inner house, for the Holy of Holies, for the doors of the house of the temple were of gold.

51. And it was complete, all the work that king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon brought in the sanctified things of his father David: the silver, and the gold, and the vessels he had put into the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.  

## 1 Kings 8

1. Then Solomon gathered the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.

2. And all the men of Israel were gathered to king Solomon, in the month of Ethanim, at the feast, which is the seventh month.

3. And all the elders of Israel came in, and the priests lifted up the ark,

4. and brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those the priests and the Levites brought.

5. And king Solomon and all the company of Israel who had assembled to him were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.

6. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, to the holy place of the house, into the Holy of Holies, to the place of the wings of the cherubs;

7. for the cherubs were spreading forth their wings to the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered over the ark, and over its staves from above.

8. And they lengthened the staves, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place on the front of the Holy of Holies, and were not seen outside; and they are there to this day.

9. Nothing was in the ark, only the two tables of stone which Moses put there in Horeb, when Jehovah cut a covenant with the sons of Israel as they went out of the land of Egypt.

10. And it happened as the priests went out from the Holy of Holies, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,

11. and the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.   

12. And Solomon said, Jehovah has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.

13. I have surely built a house of loftiness for You, a settled place for You to abide in forever.

14. And the king turned around his face and blessed the whole assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel was standing.

15. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, God of Israel, who spoke by His mouth with my father David, and by his hand has fulfilled it , saying,

16. From the day that I brought out My people, even Israel, from Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house for My name to be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.

17. And it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel;

18. and Jehovah said to my father David, Because it has been in your heart to build a house for My name, you have done well that it has been in your heart;

19. only, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall come out from your loins, he shall build the house for My name.

20. And Jehovah has established His word that He spoke; for I have risen up instead of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spoke, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel;

21. and set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He made with our fathers when He brought them out from the land of Egypt.   

22. And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah, across from the assembly of Israel, and spread his palms toward the heavens;

23. and said, Jehovah, God of Israel, there is no God like You in the heavens above or on the earth beneath; who keeps covenant and mercy with Your servants that walk before You with all their heart;

24. Who have kept for Your servant David, my father, that which You spoke to him; yea, You spoke with Your mouth, and with Your hand have fulfilled it as it is this day.

25. And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David, my father, that which You spoke to him, saying, There shall not be cut off from you a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel; only, if your sons watch their way, to walk before Me as you have walked before Me.

26. And now, O God of Israel, let it be established, I beseech You, Your word which You have spoken to Your servant, my father David.

27. But will God in truth dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built!

28. Yet You have turned toward the prayer of Your servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today;

29. for Your eyes are open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, My name shall be there; to listen to the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.

30. And You shall listen to the supplication of Your servant, and of Your people Israel when they shall pray toward this place; yea, You shall listen in Your dwelling-place, in Heaven; and You shall hear and shall forgive.

31. If any man sins against his neighbor, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and the oath has come before Your altar in this house,

32. then You shall hear in Heaven, and shall act, and shall judge Your servants, to declare the wicked to be wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare the righteous to be righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

33. When Your people Israel are stricken before the enemy, when they sin against You, if they turn again to You, and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication to You in this house;

34. then You shall hear in Heaven, and shall forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and shall bring them back to the land that You gave to their fathers.

35. When the heavens are restrained, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they have prayed toward this place, and confess Your name, and have turned from their sin because You have afflicted them,

36. then You shall hear in Heaven, and shall forgive the sin of Your servants, and of Your people Israel, for You shall teach them the good way in which they shall go, and shall give rain on Your land which You have given to Your people for an inheritance.

37. When there is famine in the land; when there is pestilence, blasting, mildew, locusts; when there is the stripping locust; when its enemy has distressed it in the land in its gates; any plague, any sickness,

38. any prayer, any supplication that shall come from any man of all of Your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of his own heart, and shall spread his palms toward this house,

39. then You shall hear in Heaven Your dwellingplace and shall forgive and shall act, and shall give to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You have known, You alone, the heart of all the sons of Adam),

40. so that they shall fear You all the days that they are living on the face of the land that You have given to our fathers.

41. And also, to the alien who is not of Your people Israel, and has come from a land afar off for Your name's sake,

42. (for they shall hear of Your great name, and of Your strong hand, and of Your stretched out arm, and he shall have come in and prayed toward this house,)

43.  You shall hear in Heaven, Your dwellingplace, and shall do according to all that the stranger calls to You for, so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, to fear You like Your people Israel, and to know that Your name has been called on this house which I have built.

44. If Your people shall go out to battle against its enemy, in the way that You have sent them, and they have prayed to Jehovah the way of the city which You have chosen, and of the house which I have built for Your name,

45. then hear their prayer and their supplication in Heaven, and maintain their cause.

46. When they sin against You (for there is not a man who does not sin) and You have been angry with them, and have given them up before an enemy, and they have been led away into captivity to the land of the enemy, far off or near;

47. and they have turned their heart back in the land where they have been taken captive, and have repented, and made supplication to You in the land of their captors, saying, We have sinned and done perversely; we have done wickedly;

48. and, they have turned back to You with all their heart, and with all the their soul, in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and have prayed to You the way of their land which You gave to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your name,

49. then You shall hear their prayer and their supplication in Heaven Your dwellingplace, and shall maintain their cause,

50. and shall forgive Your people who have sinned against You, even all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You, and shall give them mercy before their captors, and they shall have mercy on them.

51. For they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron;

52. for Your eyes shall be open to the supplication of Your servant, and to the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them in all that they call to You for;

53. for You have separated them to Yourself for an inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth, as You spoke by the hand of Your servant Moses when You brought out our fathers from Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.   

54. And it happened as Solomon finished praying to Jehovah all this prayer and supplication, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from bending on his knees, and his palms spread out to Heaven;

55. and he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,

56. Blessed be Jehovah who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He has spoken; not one word of all His good word has fallen, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Moses.

57. Jehovah our God is with us as He has been with our fathers; He shall not forsake us or leave us,

58. to incline our heart to Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments, which He commanded our fathers;

59. and these words of mine which I have prayed before Jehovah be near to Jehovah our God by day and by night, to maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, the matter of each day in its day;

60. for all the peoples of the earth know that Jehovah, He is God; there is no other;

61. let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as at this day.   

62. And the king and all Israel with him were offering a sacrifice before Jehovah;

63. and Solomon offered the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he had offered to Jehovah: twenty two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.

64. On that day the king sanctified the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah, for he had made the burnt offering there, and the food offering, and the fat of the peace offerings; because the bronze altar that was before Jehovah was too small to contain the burnt offering, and the food offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.

65. And at that time Solomon made a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, fourteen days.

66. On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went to their tents rejoicing and glad of heart for all the good that Jehovah had done to His servant David, and to His people Israel.  

## 1 Kings 9

1. And it happened, as Solomon finished building the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the desire of Solomon that he delighted to do,

2. that Jehovah appeared to Solomon a second time, as He appeared to him in Gibeon.

3. And Jehovah said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication with which you have made supplication before Me; I have sanctified this house that you have built to put My name there forever; and My eyes and My heart shall be there forever.

4. And you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, in singleness of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you; you shall keep My statutes and My judgments;

5. then I shall establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I spoke to your father David, saying, there shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.

6. If you at all turn back, you and your sons, from following me, and do not keep My commands, My statutes which I have set before you, and you shall go and serve other gods and bow yourselves to them,

7. then I shall cut off Israel from the face of the land that I have given to them, and the house that I have hallowed for My name I shall send away from My face, and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

8. As to this house, which is high, everyone passing by it shall be astonished and shall hiss, and they shall say, Why has Jehovah done this to this land and to this house?

9. And they shall say, Because they have forsaken Jehovah their God, who brought their fathers out from the land of Egypt, and they laid hold on other gods and bowed themselves to them and served them. On account of this Jehovah has brought in upon them all this evil.   

10. And it happened, at the end of twenty years Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house of the king.

11. Hiram the king of Tyre had lifted Solomon with cedar trees and with fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire; then king Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

12. And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given to him, and they were not right in his eyes.

13. And he said, What are these cities that you have given to me, my brother? And one called them the land of Cabul to this day.

14. And Hiram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.   

15. And this is the reason of the labor force that king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

16. (Pharaoh the king of Egypt had gone up and had captured Gezer, and had burned it with fire. And he killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, the wife of Solomon.)

17. and Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the lower,

18. and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land;

19. and all the store cities which Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and the desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

20. All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who were not of the sons of Israel,

21. their sons left behind them in the land, whom the sons of Israel had not been able to exterminate, Solomon even caused to go on them a burden of forced labor to this day.

22. But Solomon did not choose a slave out of the sons of Israel, for they were the men of war, and his servants, and his rulers, and his commanders, and the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.

23. These were the commanders of the officers who were over the work of Solomon: five hundred and fifty, those ruling among the people who were laboring in the work.

24. But the daughter of Pharaoh went up out of the city of David to her house that he built for her; then he built Millo.

25. And three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to Jehovah, and he burned incense on the altar before Jehovah, and finished the house.

26. And king Solomon built a navy in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the lip of the Sea of Reeds, in the land of Edom.

27. And Hiram sent his servants in the navy, shipmen who knew the sea, with the servants of Solomon;

28. and they came to Ophir and took gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it in to king Solomon.  

## 1 Kings 10

1. And the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon as to the name of Jehovah, and she came to test him with hard questions.

2. And she came to Jerusalem with a very great company, camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. And she came to Solomon and spoke with him all that had been in her heart.

3. And Solomon told her all her matters; there was not one thing hidden from the king that he did not declare to her.

4. And the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he built,

5. and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cupbearers and his burnt offering that he offered in the house of Jehovah; and there was no more breath in her.

6. And she said to the king, The word that I heard in my land was true as to your matters and your wisdom.

7. And I did not believe the words until I had come and my eyes had seen; and behold, the half was not told to me. You have wisdom and prosperity exceeding the fame which I heard.

8. Oh the happiness of your men! Oh the happiness of your servants, these who stand before you continually, who hear your wisdom!

9. Blessed be Jehovah your God who delighted in you, to put you on the throne of Israel, because Jehovah loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do judgment and righteousness.

10. And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones; no spice like that came any more for abundance, that the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

11. And also, the navy of Hiram that bore gold from Ophir brought in from Ophir almug trees, a great many, and precious stones;

12. and the king made the almug trees a support for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and lyres for singers; no such almug trees have come, nor have there been seen such to this day.

13. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, apart from that which he gave to her as a memorial of king Solomon. And she turned and went to her land, she and her servants.   

14. And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold,

15. apart from the merchant men, and from the traffic of the traders, and from all the Arabian kings, and from the governors of the lands.

16. And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred of gold went to one target;

17. and three hundred shields of beaten gold: three minas of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of canon.

18. And the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold.

19. The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind; and stays were on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays;

20. and twelve lions were standing on the six steps, on this side and on that; there was not the like made in any kingdom.

21. And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of refined gold; there was none of silver; it was not counted for anything in the days of Solomon;

22. For the king had a navy of Tarshish at sea with a navy of Hiram; once in three years the navy of Tarshish would come bearing gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

23. And king Solomon was greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom;

24. and all the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom that God had put into his heart;

25. and they were each one bringing his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.

26. And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand, four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.

27. And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as the sycamores that are in the low country, for abundance.

28. And the horses that king Solomon had were brought from Egypt, and from Kue; the king's merchants received them from Kue at a price;

29. and a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria they brought them out by their means.  

## 1 Kings 11

1. And king Solomon loved many foreign women, even the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, Hittites;

2. of the nations which Jehovah said to the sons of Israel, You shall not go in to them, and they shall not go in to you; surely they shall turn aside your heart after their gods; Solomon clung to these in love.

3. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.

4. And it happened, at the time Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, like the heart of his father David.

5. And Solomon went after Ashtoreth, goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites;

6. and Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and did not go fully after Jehovah like his father David.

7. Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the sons of Ammon;

8. and so he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.   

9. And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, for his heart had bent away from Jehovah, God of Israel who had appeared to him twice,

10. and had given a charge to him concerning this thing, not to go after other gods; and he did not keep that which Jehovah commanded.

11. And Jehovah said to Solomon, Because this has been done by you, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes that I charged on you, I shall surely tear the kingdom from you and shall give it to your servant.

12. Only, I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I shall tear it out of your son's hand.

13. Only I will not tear away all the kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for my servant David's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen.   

14. And it happened, Jehovah raised an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the seed of the king in Edom.

15. And it happened when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had stricken every male in Edom;

16. Joab and all Israel remained there six months until every male in Edom was cut off.

17. And Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; and Hadad was a little child.

18. And they rose up out of Midian and came to Paran, and they took men with them out of Paran and came into Egypt, to Pharaoh the king of Egypt. And he gave him a house and commanded bread for him, and gave land to him.

19. And Hadad found much favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and he gave him a wife, the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.

20. And the sister of Tahpenes bore him a son, Genubath, and Tahpenes weaned him in Pharaoh's house among Pharaoh's sons.

21. And Hadad had heard in Egypt that David had slept with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead. And Hadad said to Pharaoh, Send me away and I will go to my land.

22. And Pharaoh said to him, But what are you lacking with me, that, lo, you are seeking to go to your land? And he said, Nothing. However, you shall certainly send me away.

23. And God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer the king of Zobah.

24. And he gathered men to himself, and was head of a troop when David killed them. And they went to Damascus and lived in it, and reigned in Damascus.

25. And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the evil that Hadad did ; and he despised Israel and reigned over Syria.   

26. And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, a servant of Solomon (and his mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman) he also lifted up a hand against the king.

27. And this was the thing for which he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, repairing the breaks of the city of his father David.

28. And the man Jeroboam was a mighty warrior. And Solomon saw the young man, that he was doing work. And he appointed him to all the burden of the house of Joseph.

29. And at that time it happened that Jeroboam had gone out from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite, the prophet, found him in the way. And he covered himself with a new garment, and both of them were by themselves in a field.

30. And Ahijah laid hold on the new garment on him and tore it into twelve pieces.

31. And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for yourself. For so says Jehovah, God of Israel, Behold, I am tearing the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and giving to you the ten tribes.

32. And he shall have the one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.

33. Because they have forsaken Me, and bow themselves to Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, to Chemosh the god of Moab, to Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and have not walked in My ways, to do the right in My eyes, and My statutes and My judgments, as his father David did.

34. But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for My servant David's sake, whom I chose, because he kept My commands and My statutes.

35. But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, ten tribes.

36. And I will give one tribe to his son, that there may be a lamp to My servant David before Me all the days in Jerusalem the city that I have chosen to Myself, to put My name there.

37. And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.

38. And it shall be, if you shall hear all that I command you, and shall walk in My ways, and do that which is right in My eyes, to keep My statutes and My commands, as My servant David did, then I shall be with you and shall build a sure house for you, as I built for David, and shall give Israel to you.

39. And for this I will humble the seed of David; but not forever.

40. And Solomon sought to put Jeroboam to death, and Jeroboam rose up and fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king of Egypt; and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.   

41. And the rest of the matters of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?

42. And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years;

43. and Solomon lay with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.  

## 1 Kings 12

1. And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.

2. And it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard (and he was still in Egypt where he had fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt)

3. that they sent and called for him; and they came, Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,

4. Your father made our yoke hard; and now you should lighten some of the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve you.

5. And he said to them, Go; yet in three days come back to me. And the people went.

6. And king Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had been standing before the face of his father Solomon while he was alive, saying, How do you advise in order to answer this people?

7. And they spoke to him, saying, If you are servant to this people today, and will serve them, and answer them and speak to them good words, then they will be servants to you forever.

8. But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they advised him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, who were standing before him.

9. And he said to them, What do you advise, and we shall answer the people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten some of the yoke that your father put upon us?

10. And they spoke to him, the young men who had grown up with him, saying, So you shall say to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and you make it light on us; so you shall speak to them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father,

11. and now my father laid a heavy yoke on you, and I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I will surely chastise you with scorpions.

12. And they came, Jeroboam and all the people, to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me on the third day.

13. And the king replied to the people harshly, and forsook the counsel of the elders which they advised him,

14. and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I shall add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I will surely chastise you with scorpions.

15. And the king did not listen to the people, for the revolution was from Jehovah, in order to establish His word that Jehovah spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.   

16. And all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, and the people sent the king back word, saying, What portion do we have in David? Yea, there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see  to your house, O David! And Israel went to its tents.

17.  As to the sons of Israel, those living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

18. And king Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the tribute, and all Israel threw stones at him, and he died. And king Rehoboam made haste to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem.

19. And Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.

20. And it happened when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent and called him to the company, and caused him to reign over all Israel; none followed after the house of David except the tribe of Judah only.

21. And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, and gathered all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen makers of war to fight with the house of Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon,

22. then the word of God came to Shemaiah a man of God, saying,

23. Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah, and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying,

24. So says Jehovah, You shall not go up nor fight with your brothers the sons of Israel. Each turn back to his house, for this thing has been from Me. And they heard the word of Jehovah, and turned to go back, according to the word of Jehovah.   

25. And Jeroboam built Shechem in the hills of Ephraim and lived in it, and went out from there and built Penuel.

26. And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom shall turn back to the house of David;

27. if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people shall turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam the king of Judah, and they will kill me and go again to Rehoboam the king of Judah.

28. And the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!

29. And he set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.

30. And this thing became a sin, for the people went before the one, to Dan.

31. And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of people, who were not of the sons of Levi.

32. And Jeroboam made a feast in the eighth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah; and he offered on the altar, so he did in Bethel, to sacrifice to the calves which he made; and he made stand in Bethel the priests of the high places that he made.

33. And he offered up on the altar that he made in Bethel, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month that he devised out of his own heart; and he made a feast for the sons of Israel, and offered on the altar, to burn incense.  

## 1 Kings 13

1. And, behold, a man of God had come from Judah to Bethel, by the word of Jehovah, and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.

2. And he cried against the altar, by the word of Jehovah, and said, Altar! Altar! So says Jehovah, Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, his name Josiah, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who are burning incense on you, and they shall burn the bones of man on you.

3. And on that day he gave a sign, saying, This is the sign that Jehovah has spoken, Behold, the altar is torn, and the ashes that are on it poured out.

4. And it happened when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God which he had cried against the altar in Bethel, he put out his hand from the altar, saying, Seize him. And his hand which he put out against him withered, and he was not able to bring it back to him.

5. And the altar was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.

6. And the king answered and said to the man of God, Please entreat the face of Jehovah your God, and pray for me, and my hand shall come back to me. And the man of God entreated the face of Jehovah, and the hand of the king came back to him, and it was as at the beginning.

7. And the king spoke to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a gift.

8. And the man of God said to the king, If you would give me the half of your house, I would not go in with you, nor will I eat bread, nor will I drink water in this place.

9. For so He commanded me by the word of Jehovah, saying, You shall not eat bread nor drink water, nor turn back in the way that you have come.

10. And he went on another way, and did not turn back in the way in which he came into Bethel.   

11. And a certain aged prophet was living in Bethel, and his son came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel, the words that he had spoken to the king; yea, they told them to their father.

12. And their father said to them, Where is this man , what way did he go? And his sons saw the way that the man of God from Judah had gone.

13. And he said to his sons, Saddle the ass for me. And they saddled the ass for him, and he rode on it,

14. and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak tree. And he said to him, are you the man of God who has come from Judah? And he said, I am .

15. Then he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread.

16. And he said, I am not able to go back with you, and to go in with you, nor may I eat bread or drink water with you in this place;

17. for a word came to me by the word of Jehovah, You shall not eat bread nor drink water there you shall not turn back to go in the way in which you came.

18. And he said to him, I also am a prophet like yourself, and an angel spoke to me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with you into your house, and he shall eat bread and water (he lied to him).

19. And he turned back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.

20. And it happened as they were sitting at the table, and a word of Jehovah came to the prophet who brought him back;

21. and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, So says Jehovah, Because you have resisted the mouth of Jehovah, and have not kept the command that Jehovah your God charged you,

22. and turned back and ate bread and drank water in the place of which He said to you, You shall not eat bread nor drink water; your carcass shall not come to the burying place of your fathers.   

23. And after he ate bread and after he drank, it happened that he saddled the ass for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back.

24. And he left, and a lion found him in the way and killed him; and his carcass was thrown down in the way, and the ass was standing near it, and the lion was standing near the carcass.

25. And behold, men were passing by and saw the carcass thrown in the way, and the lion standing near the carcass; and they came and reported it in the city in which the old prophet lived.

26. And the prophet who brought him back out of the way heard and said, It is the man of God who provoked the mouth of Jehovah, and Jehovah gave him to the lion, and it tore him apart and killed him, according to the word of Jehovah that He spoke to him.

27. And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the ass for me. And they saddled.

28. And he went and found the carcass thrown down in the way, and the ass and the lion were standing near the carcass; the lion had not eaten the carcass nor had he torn apart the ass.

29. And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God and placed it on the ass, and brought it back; and the old prophet came into the city to mourn and to bury him.

30. And he placed his carcass in his own grave, and they mourned for him, O my brother!

31. And it happened, after he buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, At my death, you shall bury me in the burying place in which the man of God is buried; place my bones beside his bones;

32. for the word that he cried by the word of Jehovah concerning the altar in Bethel, and concerning all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely occur.

33. After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but turned again and made from the lowest of the people priests of high places; he who desired, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.

34. And in this thing is the sin of the house of Jeroboam, even to blot it from off the face of the earth.  

## 1 Kings 14

1. At that time Ahijah the son of Jeroboam was sick.

2. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Please rise up and disguise yourself, that you may not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam. And you shall go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there. He spoke to me of being king over this people.

3. And you shall take ten loaves in your hand, and biscuits, and a flask of honey, and come to him. He will tell you what shall become of the boy.

4. And Jeroboam's wife did so, and rose up and went to Shiloh and entered the house of Ahijah. And Ahijah was not able to see, for his eyes were set because of his age.

5. And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask a thing of you for her son, for he is sick. You shall say this and this to her, and it shall be when she comes in, she will act as a foreigner.

6. And it happened when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in the door, he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you acting as a foreigner? And I am sent to you with a hard thing.   

7. Go, say to Jeroboam, So says Jehovah, God of Israel, Because I have exalted you from among the people, and have appointed you leader over My people Israel;

8. and have torn the kingdom from the house of David, and have given it to you, and you have not been as My servant David who kept My commandments, and who walked after Me with all his heart, to do only that which is right in My eyes;

9. and you did evil above all who have been before you, and went and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger; and you have cast Me behind your back

10. therefore, behold, I am bringing evil to the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him who urinates against the wall, bound and free in Israel; and will sweep away the rest of the house of Jeroboam as a man sweeps away the dung, until it is all gone.

11. The dogs shall eat those of Jeroboam who die in the city. And the birds of the heavens shall eat those who die in a field; for Jehovah has spoken.

12. And you, rise up, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the boy shall die.

13. And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him, for only this one of Jeroboam shall come to the grave because there has been found in him a good thing toward Jehovah, God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.

14. And Jehovah shall raise up a king over Israel for Himself, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam this day. And what? Even now!

15. And Jehovah shall strike Israel as the reed waves in the water, and shall pluck up Israel from off this good land that He gave to their fathers. And He shall scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherahs, provoking Jehovah to anger.

16. And He shall give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned, and that he caused Israel to sin.

17. And Jeroboam's wife rose up and left, and came to Tirzah. She came in to the threshold of the house, and the boy died.

18. And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah that He spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.

19. And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel.

20. And the days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty two years. And he lay with his fathers, and his son Nadab reigned in his place.   

21. And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty one years old when he began to reign. And he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.

22. And Judah did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked Him to jealousy above all their fathers did by their sins that they had sinned.

23. And they built, they also, high places for themselves, and standing pillars, and Asherahs on every high hill, and under every green tree.

24. And also the sodomite was in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah expelled before the sons of Israel.

25. And it happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak the king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem.

26. And he took the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house; yea, he took all. And he took all the golden shields that Solomon had made.

27. And king Rehoboam made in their place bronze shields. And he gave them into the hand of the commander of the runners, who kept the door of the king's house.

28. And it happened, when the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners bore them, and brought them back to the room of the runners.

29. And the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Judah?

30. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

31. And Rehoboam lay with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And his son Abijam reigned in his place.  

## 1 Kings 15

1. And in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam reigned over Judah.

2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom.

3. And he walked in all the sins of his father, those that he did before him, and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of his father David.

4. But for David's sake Jehovah his God gave to him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem.

5.  For David did that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, and did not turn aside from all that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

6. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

7. And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

8. And Abijam lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Asa reigned in his place.   

9. And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel Asa reigned over Judah.

10. And he reigned forty one years in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom.

11. And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like his father David.

12. And he removed the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers made.

13. And he also removed his mother Maachah from being queen, in that she made a horrid thing for Asherah. And Asa cut down her horrid thing and burned it by the torrent Kidron.

14. But they did not remove the high places. Only the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all the days.

15. And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and his holy things, into the house of Jehovah, silver and gold and vessels.

16. And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

17. And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, to keep anyone from going out and coming in to Asa the king of Judah.

18. And Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into his servants' hand; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, the king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,

19. A treaty between you and me, between my father and your father! Behold, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha the king of Israel, that he go up from me.

20. And Ben-hadad listened to king Asa, and sent his army commanders against the cities of Israel. And he struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

21. And it happened, when Baasha heard, he ceased building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

22. And king Asa proclaimed to all Judah (no one was exempt) and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber with which Baasha had built. And king Asa built with it Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

23. And the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Judah? Only, at the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.

24. And Asa lay with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David. And his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place.   

25. And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa the king of Judah. And he reigned over Israel two years.

26. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.

27. And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him And Baasha struck him at Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines'. For Nadab and all Israel had laid siege to Gibbethon.

28. And in the third year of Asa the king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place.

29. And it happened when he reigned, he struck all the house of Jeroboam; he did not leave Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him. according to the saying of Jehovah which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the man of Shiloh;

30. because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and that he caused Israel to sin by his provocation with which he provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger.

31. And the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?

32. And there was war between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel all their days.

33. Inn the third year of Asa the king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah reigned over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty four years.

34. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he caused Israel to sin.  

## 1 Kings 16

1. And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,

2. Since I have raised you up out of the dust, and made you ruler over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and caused My people Israel to sin, to provoke Me to anger with their sins;

3. behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

4. Him who dies of Baasha in the city, the dogs shall eat; and whoever of his dies in the field, the birds of the heavens shall eat.

5. And the rest of the acts of Baasha, and that which he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?

6. And Baasha lay with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah. And his son Elah reigned in his place.

7. And also by the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani the prophet, the word of Jehovah came against Baasha, and against his house, and against all the evil that he did in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger with the work of his hands, to be like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed him.

8. In the twenty sixth year of Asa the king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

9. And his servant Zimri, the captain of half of the chariots, conspired against him. And he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the house of Tirzah.

10. And Zimri came in and struck him, and killed him in the twenty seventh year of Asa the king of Judah, and reigned in his place.

11. And it happened, when he began to reign, as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha; he did not leave him one who urinated against the wall, nor of his kinsmen, nor of his friends.

12. And Zimri destroyed the whole house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah that He spoke as to Baasha, by the hand of Jehu the prophet;

13. concerning all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Elah that they sinned, and that they caused Israel to sin, to provoke to anger Jehovah the God of Israel with their vanities.

14. And the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?   

15. In the twenty seventh year of Asa the king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. And the people were camped against Gibbethon, which was the Philistines'.

16. And the people who were encamped heard, saying, Zimri has conspired and has struck the king. And all Israel made Omri the commander of the army to rule over Israel on that day in the camp.

17. And Omri went up, and all Israel with him from Gibbethon, and they laid siege to Tirzah.

18. And it happened when Zimri saw that the city would be captured he came into a high place of the king and burned the house of the king with fire over him, and died,

19. for his sins that he sinned, to do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to walk in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin that he did, to cause Israel to sin.

20. And the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?

21. Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath to cause him to reign, and the other half after Omri.

22. And the people that followed Omri were stronger than the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; and Tibni died, and Omri reigned.

23. In the thirty first year of Asa the king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah;

24. then he bought the hill Samaria from Shemer with two talents of silver, and built the hill, and called the name of the city that he built by the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, that is Samaria.

25. And Omri did that which was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and did evil above all who were before him,

26. and walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin that he caused Israel to sin, to provoke to anger Jehovah the God of Israel with their vanities.

27. And the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and his might that he attained, are they not written in the of the Matters of the Days of the Kings of Israel?

28. And Omri laid down with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria. And his son Ahab reigned in his place.   

29. And in the thirty eighth year of Asa the king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. And Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty two years;

30. and Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Jehovah above all who were before him.

31. And it happened as if it were a light thing, that he walked in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took a wife, Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and bowed himself to it.

32. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

33. And Ahab made an Asherah, and Ahab did still more to provoke to anger Jehovah the God of Israel than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

34. In his days Hiel the man of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation in his firstborn Abiram, and he set up its doors in Segub his youngest, according to the word of Jehovah that He spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun.  

## 1 Kings 17

1. And Elijah the Tishbite, of the sojourners of Gilead, said to Ahab, As Jehovah the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be no dew nor rain these years, except according to my word.

2. And the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,

3. Go away from here; and you shall turn eastward and shall hide by the torrent Cherith, that is before Jordan.

4. And it shall be, you shall drink of the torrent; and I shall command the ravens to feed you there.

5. And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah; for he went and lived by the torrent Cherith, that is before Jordan.

6. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.

7. And it after a while, that the torrent dried up, because there was no rain in the land.   

8. And the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,

9. Rise up, go to Zarephath that belongs to Sidon; and you shall live there. Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you.

10. And he rose up and went to Zarephath, and came in to the entrance of the city; and, behold, a widow woman was gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, Please bring to me a little water in a vessel, and I shall drink.

11. And she went to bring it . And he called to her and said, Please bring me a bit of bread in your hand.

12. And she said, As Jehovah your God lives, I do not have a cake, only a handful of meal in a pitcher, and a little oil in a jar; and behold, I am gathering two sticks and will go in and prepare for myself and for my son; and we shall eat it, and die.

13. And Elijah said to her, Do not fear, go, do according to your word, only first make me a little cake of it, and bring to me and afterward prepare for you and for your son.

14. For so says Jehovah the God of Israel, The pitcher of meal shall not be consumed, and the jar of oil shall not fail, until the day that Jehovah sends rain on the land.

15. And she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and she ate, she and he and her household, many days;

16. the pitcher of meal was not consumed, and the jar of oil did not fail, according to the word of Jehovah that He spoke by the hand of Elijah.   

17. And it happened after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house became sick; and his illness was very severe until he had no breath left to him.

18. And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to cause my iniquity to be remembered, and to put my son to death?

19. And he said to her, Give me your son; and he took him out of her bosom, and caused him to go up into the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.

20. And he cried to Jehovah and said, Jehovah my God, have You also brought evil on the widow with whom I am staying, by slaying her son?

21. And he stretched himself on the child three times, and called to Jehovah and said, O Jehovah my God, I beg You, let the soul of this boy return to him.

22. And Jehovah listened to the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the boy returned to him, and he lived.

23. And Elijah took the boy and brought him down from the upper room of the house, and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, See your son lives!

24. And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know this, that you are a man of God, and the word of Jehovah in your mouth is truth.  

## 1 Kings 18

1. And it happened after many days the word of Jehovah came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will give rain on the face of the earth.

2. And Elijah went to be seen by Ahab. And the famine in Samaria was severe.

3. And Ahab called to Obadiah, who was over the house (and Obadiah greatly feared Jehovah;

4. and it happened, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and had hidden them, fifty men in a cave, and had fed them with bread and water)

5. and Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land to all the fountains of water, and to all the torrents; perhaps we may find grass and keep alive horse and mule, and will not cut off any of the livestock.

6. And they divided the land to themselves, to pass over into it; Ahab went in one way by himself, and Obadiah went in another way by himself.

7. And Obadiah was in the highway; and behold, Elijah came to meet him. And he recognized him, and he fell on his face, and said, Are you this one, my lord Elijah?

8. And he said to him, I am ; Go, say to your lord, Behold, Elijah!

9. And he said, What have I sinned, that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me?

10.  As Jehovah your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you; and when they said, He is not here, then he caused the kingdom and the nation to swear that it did not find you.

11. And now, you are saying, Go, say to your lord, Behold, Elijah.

12. And it shall be, I will go away from you, and the Spirit of Jehovah will lift you up, where I do not know, and I will come to tell Ahab, and he will not find you, and he will kill me. And your servant has feared Jehovah from my youth.

13. Was it not told to my lord that which I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Jehovah, but I hid a hundred men of the prophets, fifty by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?

14. And now you are saying, Go, say to your lord, Behold, Elijah, and he will kill me!

15. And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely today I will be seen by him.

16. And Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.   

17. And it happened when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Are you he, the disturber of Israel?

18. And he answered, I have not disturbed Israel, but you and the house of your father, in that you have forsaken the commands of Jehovah, and you have gone after the Baals.

19. And now send, gather all Israel to me, to Mount Carmel and four hundred and fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of Asherah, who eat at the table of Jezebel.

20. And Ahab sent among all the sons of Israel and gathered the prophets to Mount Carmel.   

21. And Elijah came near all the people and said, Until when are you limping over two opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow Him; and if Baal, follow him. But the people did not answer him a word.

22. Then Elijah said to the people, I, I alone, remain a prophet of Jehovah; but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.

23. Then let them give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and place it on the wood, and place no fire. And I, I will prepare the other bullock and will put it on the wood, and I will not place fire.

24. And you shall call on the name of your god; and I, I will call on the name of Jehovah; and it shall be, the god who answers by fire, he is the God. And all the people answered and said, The word is good.

25. And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose the one bullock for yourself, and prepare first, for you are many; and you call on the name of your god, but place no fire.

26. And they took the bullock that was given to them, and prepared, and called on the name of Baal from the morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us! And there was no sound, and no one was answering; and they leaped about the altar that one had made.

27. And it happened at noon, that Elijah taunted them and said, Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating, or pursuing, or on a journey; it may be he is asleep and must be awakened.

28. And they called with a loud voice, and cut themselves, according to their way, with swords and with spears until blood gushed out on them.

29. And it happened as noon passed by, that they prophesied madly until the offering up of the offering; and no sound came , and no one was answering, and no one was paying attention.

30. And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him; and he healed the altar of Jehovah that had been broken down.

31. And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be your name.

32. And he built an altar with the stones in the name of Jehovah, and made a trench around the altar large as two seahs of seed in space.

33. And he arranged the wood, and cut the bullock in pieces, and placed it on the wood, and said, Fill four water jars of water and pour on the burnt offering and on the wood.

34. And he said, Do it a second time; and they did it a second time; and he said, Do it a third time; and they did it a third time.

35. And the water went around the altar, and also he filled the trench with water.

36. And it happened at the offering of the sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel, and I Your servant, that by Your word I have done all these things.

37. Answer me, O Jehovah, answer me; and this people shall know that You are Jehovah God; and You shall turn their hearts back again.

38. And fire fell from Jehovah and burned up the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and the water in the trench was licked up.

39. And all the people saw, and fell on their faces, and said, Jehovah, He is the God; Jehovah, He is the God!

40. And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let a man of them escape. And they caught them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon and killed them there.   

41. And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink, because of the sound of abundance of rain.

42. And Ahab went up to eat, and to drink; and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he stretched himself out on the earth, and he put his face between his knees;

43. and said to his young man, Now go up, look closely to the way of the sea. And he went up and looked closely, and said, There is nothing; and he said, Go back seven times.

44. And it happened at the seventh time , he said, Behold, a little cloud like the palm of a man is coming up out of the sea. And he said, Go up and say to Ahab, Bind up and go down, that the rain may not stop you.

45. And until this and this, it happened that the heavens became black with thick clouds and wind, and the rain was heavy; and Ahab rode and went to Jezreel;

46. and the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab until you enter Jezreel.  

## 1 Kings 19

1. And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah did, and all that he killed, all the prophets by the sword.

2. And Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do, and more so, if not at this time tomorrow I will cause your life to be as the life of one of them.

3. And he saw, and rose up and went for his life, and came to Beersheba of Judah, and left his young man there;

4. and he himself went into the wilderness a day's journey, and came and sat under a certain broom tree. And he begged for his life, that he might die, and said, Enough, now, O Jehovah; take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.

5. And he lay down and slept under a certain broom tree; and behold, an angel touched him and said to him, Get up, eat!

6. And he looked, and behold, at his head was a cake on burning stones, and a jar of water; and he ate and drank, and turned and lay down.

7. And the angel of Jehovah returned a second time, and touched him, and said, Get up, eat, for the way is too great for you.

8. And he rose up and ate and drank, and went in the power of that food forty days and forty nights to the mount of God, Horeb.   

9. And he came there to the cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah?

10. And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts, for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant; they have thrown down Your altars, and they have killed Your prophets with the sword, and I am left, I alone, and they seek to take my life.

11. And he said, Go out and stand on the mountain before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind tearing the mountains and breaking the rocks in bits before Jehovah! Jehovah was not in the wind. And after the wind was an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake.

12. And after the earthquake was a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire; and after the fire came a still, small voice.

13. And it happened when Elijah heard, he wrapped his face in his robe and went out and stood at the cave opening; and, behold, a voice came to him, and it said, What are you doing here, Elijah?

14. And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah, God of Hosts for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant; they have thrown down Your altars, and they have slain Your prophets by the sword; and I, I alone, am left; and they seek to take my life.

15. And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and you shall go in and anoint Hazael as king over Syria;

16. and you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat, of Abel-meholah, as prophet in your place.

17. And it shall be, he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.

18. And I have left in Israel seven thousand, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.   

19. And he left there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat; and he was plowing; twelve pairs were before him, and he was with the twelfth. And Elijah passed over to him, and threw his mantle upon him.

20. And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said to him, Go back; for what have I done to you?

21. And he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen, and sacrificed them, and boiled their flesh with the yoke of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered to him.  

## 1 Kings 20

1. And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.

2. And he sent messengers to Ahab the king of Israel, to the city, and said to him, So says Ben-hadad,

3. Your silver and your gold are mine, and your wives and your sons, the best, are mine.

4. And the king of Israel answered and said, According to your word, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.

5. And the messengers came again and said, So says Ben-hadad, saying, Surely I sent to you, saying, Your silver and your gold and your wives and your sons you shall give to me;

6. I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and your servants' houses; and it shall be that whatever is pleasing in your eyes, they will put it in their hand and take it away.

7. And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Please note, and see the evil this one is seeking, for he sent to me for my wives, and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I did not withhold from him.

8. And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do not listen nor consent.

9. And he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Say to my lord the king, All that you sent for to your servant at the first, I will do; but this thing I am not able to do; and the messengers went and took word back to him.

10. And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, So shall the gods do to me and more also if the dust of Samaria shall be enough for handfuls for all the people that follow me.

11. And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him , Do not let him that girds on boast himself like one who loosens his armor .   

12. And it happened when this word was heard, and he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said to his servants, Set in order; and they set in order against the city.

13. And behold, a certain prophet came near to Ahab the king of Israel, and said, So says Jehovah, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold I am going to give it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

14. And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, So says Jehovah, by the young men of the rulers of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, You.

15. Then he numbered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the sons of Israel, being seven thousand.

16. And they went out at noon, and Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty two kings helping him.

17. And the young men of the rulers of the provinces went out at first; and Ben-hadad sent, and they told him, saying, Men have come out of Samaria.

18. And he said, If they have come out for peace, seize them alive; and if they have come to battle, seize them alive.

19. And these went out of the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them.

20. And each struck his man, and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse, also the horsemen.

21. And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses, and the chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great blow.   

22. And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, Go, make yourself strong, and look and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.

23. And the king of Syria's servants said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; on account of this they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely, we shall be stronger than they,

24. And do this thing: take away the kings, each out of his place, and set commanders in their place.

25. And number to yourself an army like the army that was lost from you, even horse for horse and chariot for chariot; and we shall fight with them in the plain. Are we not stronger than they? And he listened to their voice and did so.

26. And it happened at the turn of the year, Ben-hadad called up the Syrians, and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.

27. And the sons of Israel were called up, and were fed. And they went to meet them. And the sons of Israel camped before them, like two flocks of goats. And the Syrians filled the land.

28. And a man of God came near to the king of Israel and said, So says Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is God of the hills and not God of the valleys, therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

29. And they pitched, these against those, seven days. And it happened in the seventh day, the battle came up. And the sons of Israel struck Syria, a hundred thousand footmen in one day.

30. And those remaining fled to Aphek, to the city. And the wall fell on twenty seven thousand of those left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room.   

31. And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and we shall go to the king of Israel. It may be he will keep alive your life.

32. And they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads. And they came in to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-hadad has said, Please let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? He is my brother.

33. And the men keenly observed, and quickly caught it from him, and said, Your brother, Ben-hadad. And he said, Go, bring him. And Ben-hadad came out to him. And he took him up on the chariot.

34. And he said to him, The cities that my father took from your father, I give back. And you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria. Then I will let you go with a covenant. And he cut a covenant with him and sent him away.

35. And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor, By the word of Jehovah, please strike me. And the man refused to strike him.

36. And he said to him, Because you have not listened to the voice of Jehovah, behold, you shall go from me, and a lion shall kill you. And he left him, and a lion found him and killed him.

37. And he found another man and said, Please strike me. And the man struck him, striking and wounding.

38. And the prophet went and stood for the king on the highway, and disguised himself with ashes on his eyes.

39. And as the king passed by, it happened that he cried to the king, and said, Your servant went out into the middle of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man. If he is at all missing, then your life shall be for his life; or you shall weigh out a talent of silver.

40. And it happened, your servant was working here and there, and he was not there . And the king of Israel said to him, Your judgment is right. You have decided it .

41. And he hurried and took the ashes from his eyes. And the king of Israel saw him, that he was of the prophets.

42. And he said to him, So says Jehovah, Because you have sent away the man I had devoted from your hand, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.

43. And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.  

## 1 Kings 21

1. And it happened after these things, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, near the palace of Ahab the king of Samaria.

2. And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, and it shall be a garden of green herbs for me, for it is near my house. And I will give to you in its place a better vineyard than it. If it is good in your eyes, I will give silver to you, the price of this one.

3. And Naboth said to Ahab, Far be it from me, by Jehovah, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.

4. And Ahab came into his house sullen and angry over the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken. For he had said, I will not give the inheritance of my fathers to you. And he lay on his bed and turned away his face, and would not eat food.   

5. And his wife Jezebel came in to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit sullen that you are not eating food?

6. And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you desire, I will give you a vineyard in its place. And he said, I will not give you my vineyard.

7. And his wife Jezebel said to him, Do you now rule over Israel? Rise up, eat food and let your heart be good. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

8. And she wrote letters in the name of Ahab, and sealed with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles of his city, dwelling with Naboth.

9. And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.

10. And set two men, sons of worthlessness, across from him; and they shall testify of him, saying, You have cursed God and the king. And they shall bring him out and stone him; and he shall die.

11. And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as was written in the letters that she sent to them.

12. They proclaimed a fast, and made Naboth to sit at the head of the people.

13. And two men, sons of worthlessness, came in and sat across from him. And the men of worthlessness testified of him before the people, even Naboth, saying, Naboth has cursed God and the king. And they took him out to the outside of the city, and stoned him with stones. And he died.

14. And they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.

15. And it happened when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned, and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, Rise up, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, that he refused to give to you for silver. For Naboth is not alive, but dead.

16. And it happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab rose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.   

17. And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

18. Rise up, Go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to possess it.

19. And you shall speak to him, saying, So says Jehovah, Have you murdered, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, So says Jehovah, In the place where the dogs lick the blood of Naboth, so the dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.

20. And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he said, I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the eyes of Jehovah.

21. Behold, I shall bring evil on you, and shall take away your posterity, and cut off to Ahab him who urinates against a wall, both bond and free in Israel.

22. And I shall give up your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked to anger, and have caused Israel to sin.

23. And also Jehovah has spoken of Jezebel, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

24. He who dies of Ahab in the city, the dogs shall eat. And the birds of the heaven shall eat him who dies in a field.

25. Surely, none has been like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, whom his wife Jezebel incited.

26. And he did abominably, to go after idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah expelled from before the sons of Israel.

27. And it happened, when Ahab heard these words, he tore his garments, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

28. And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

29. Have you seen that Ahab has been humbled before Me? Because he was humbled before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days. I will bring the evil on his house in the days of his son.  

## 1 Kings 22

1. And they continued three years; there was no war between Syria and Israel.

2. And it happened in the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

3. And the king of Israel said to his servants, Have you known that Ramoth-gilead is ours? And we remain still from taking it from the king of Syria's hand.

4. And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go to battle with me, to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you, my people as your people; my horses as your horses.

5. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire at the word of Jehovah today.

6. And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, that the Lord may give it into the hand of the king.

7. And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?

8. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Yet one man, to seek Jehovah by him. But I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil, Micaiah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, let not the king say so.

9. And the king of Israel called to a certain eunuch and said, Cause Micaiah the son of Imlah to hurry.

12. And all the prophets were prophesying so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper. For Jehovah shall give it into the king's hand.

13. And the messenger that had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets with one mouth are good to the king. Please let your word be as the word of one of them, and speak good.

14. And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, Surely that which Jehovah says to me, that I will speak.   

15. And he came in to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to battle to Ramoth-gilead, or shall we forbear? And he said to him, Go up, and prosper, and Jehovah shall give it into the king's hand.

16. And the king said to him, How many times have I adjured you that you shall speak nothing to me but truth in the name of Jehovah?

17. And he said, I have seen all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no ruler; they shall each return to his house in peace.

18. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say to you, He will not prophesy good of me, but evil?

19. And he said, Therefore, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven were standing by Him, on His right and on His left.

20. And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, and he shall go up and fall in Ramoth-gilead? And this one said this, and this one said that.

21. And a spirit came forth and stood before Jehovah, and said, I surely will entice him.

22. And Jehovah said to him, By what means? And he said, I will go out and shall be a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said, You shall entice him , and also you are able. Go out and do so.

23. And now, behold, Jehovah has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these prophets of yours; and Jehovah has spoken evil as to you!

24. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Where did the Spirit of Jehovah pass over from me to speak with you?

25. And Micaiah said, Behold, You shall see on that day when you go into the innermost room to be hidden.

26. And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the ruler of the city, and to Joash the king's son,

27. and say, So says the king, Put this one in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat the bread of oppression, and the water of oppression, until I come in peace.

28. And Micaiah said, If you at all return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, O people, all of them.   

29. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

30. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and enter into the battle. But you put on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.

41. And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa reigned over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab the king of Israel.

42. He was a son of thirty five years when he began to reign. And he reigned twenty five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
