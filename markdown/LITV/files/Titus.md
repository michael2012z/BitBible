# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of the elect of God and full knowledge of the truth according to godliness,

2. on hope of eternal life which the God who does not lie promised before the eternal times,

3. but revealed in its own times in a proclamation of His word, with which I was entrusted by the command of our Savior God:

4. to Titus, a true child according to our common faith. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.   

5. For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I ordered you:   

6. If anyone is blameless, husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of loose behavior, or disobedient,

7. (for the overseer must be blameless as a steward of God), not self-pleasing, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not a quarreler, not greedy of ill gain;

8. but hospitable, a lover of good, discreet, just, holy, temperate,

9. clinging to the faithful word according to the teaching, that he may be able both to encourage by sound doctrine and to convict the ones contradicting.

10. For there are indeed many disobedient men, empty talkers and mind-deluders, especially those of the circumcision,

11. whose mouth you must stop, who overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of ill gain.

12. One of them, a prophet of their own, said: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.

13. This testimony is true; for which cause convict them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not listening to Jewish myths and commandments of men, having turned away from the truth.

15. Truly, all things are pure to the pure, but to the ones having been defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience has been defiled.

16. They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him , being abominable and disobedient, and worthless to every good work.  

## Titus 2

1. But you speak things which become sound doctrine:

2. aged men to be temperate, sensible, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;

3. aged women likewise in reverent behavior, not slanderers, not having been enslaved by much wine, teachers of good,

4. that they might train the young women to be lovers of husbands, lovers of children,

5. discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed,

6. the younger men in the same way exhort to be discreet;

7. having shown yourself a pattern of good works about all things in doctrine, in purity, sensibleness, incorruption,

8.  in sound speech, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may he ashamed, having nothing bad to say about you.

9. Let slaves be subject to their own masters, well-pleasing in all things , not speaking against them ,

10. not stealing, but showing all good faith, that they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior God in all things.   

11. For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,

12. instructing us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live discreetly and righteously and godly in the present age,

13. looking for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,

14. who gave Himself on our behalf, "that He might redeem us from all iniquity" "and purify" "a people" "for His own possession," zealous of good works. Psa. 130:8; Eze. 37:23; Deut. 14:2   

15. Speak these things and exhort and convict with all authority. Let no one despise you.  

## Titus 3

1. Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready in every good work,

2. to speak evil of no one, not quarrelsome, but forbearing, having displayed all meekness to all men.

3. For we also once were senseless, disobedient, led astray, slaving for various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.

4. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,

5. not by works in righteousness which we had done, but according to His mercy, He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,

6. whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ, our Savior;

7. that being justified by His grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. Faithful is the Word, and concerning these things I desire you strongly to affirm that the ones believing God should take thought to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.   

9. But keep back from foolish questionings and genealogies and arguments and quarrels of law, for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. After the first and second warning, avoid a man of heresy,

11. knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned.

12. When I shall send Artemas to you or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis. For I have decided to winter there.

13. Diligently set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that nothing be lacking to them.

14. And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be without fruit.

15. All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
