# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. A Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to show to His slaves things which must occur quickly. And He signified by sending through His angel to His slave, John,

2. who testified of the Word of God and the witness of Jesus Christ, even as many things as he saw.   

3. Blessed is the one reading, and those hearing the words of this prophecy, and keeping the things having been written; for the time is near.

4. John to the seven churches in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven spirits which are before His throne;

5. even from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the First-born out of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him loving us and washing us from our sins by His blood,

6. and made us kings and priests to God, even His Father. To Him is the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.

7. "Behold, He comes with the clouds," and "every eye will see Him, and the ones who pierced" Him, and all the tribes of the earth "will wail on account of Him." Yes, Amen. Dan. 7:13; Zech. 12:10

8. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.   

9. I, even your brother John, and co-sharer in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, came to be in the island being called Patmos because of the Word of God, and because of the witness of Jesus Christ.

10. I came to be in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,

11. saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last; also, What you see, write in a scroll, and send to the seven churches of Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me.

13. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of man, having been clothed to the feet, and having been girded with a golden girdle at the breasts.

14. And the hairs of His head were white as white wool, as snow, and His eyes as a flame of fire;

15. and His feet like burnished brass having been fired in a furnace; and His voice as a sound of many waters;

16. and having in His right hand seven stars; and a sharp, two-edged sword proceeding out of His mouth, and His face shining as the sun in its power.

17. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet, as dead. And He put His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not fear. I am the First and the Last,

18. and the Living One; and I became dead; and, behold, I am living forever and ever. Amen. And I have the keys to Hades, and of death.

19. Write what things you saw, and what things are, and what things are about to occur after these things.

20. The mystery of the seven stars which you saw on My right, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands you saw are seven churches.  

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the Ephesian church, write: These things says the One holding the seven stars in His right hand , He walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:

2. I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and that you cannot bear evil ones; and you tried those pretending to be apostles and are not, and found them to be liars.

3. And I know you bore up and have patience and on account of My name you have labored and have not wearied,

4. But I have against you that you left your first love.

5. Then remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the first works. And if not, I am coming to you quickly, and will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.

6. But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one overcoming, I will give to him to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.   

8. And to the angel of the church of Smyrna, write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and lived:

9. I know your works, and the affliction, and the poverty; but you are rich. And I know the evil speaking of those saying themselves to be Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

10. Do not at all fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil is about to throw you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.

11. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one overcoming will not at all be hurt by the second death.   

12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write: These things says the One having the sharp, two-edged sword:

13. I know your works, and where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is . And you hold My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful witness; who was killed alongside you, where Satan dwells.

14. But I have a few things against you, that you have there those holding the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices, and to commit fornication.

15. So you also have those holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

16. Repent! But if not, I will come to you quickly, and I will make war with them by the sword of My mouth.

17. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one overcoming, I will give him to eat from the hidden manna. And I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name having been written, which no one knows except the one receiving it .   

18. And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write: These things says the Son of God, the One having His eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like burnished brass:

19. I know your works, and the love, and the ministry, and the faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last more than the first.

20. But I have a few things against you, that you allow the woman Jezebel to teach, she saying herself to be a prophetess, and to cause My slaves to go astray, and to commit fornication, and to eat idol sacrifices.

21. And I gave time to her that she might repent of her fornication. And she did not repent.

22. Behold, I am throwing her into a bed, and into great affliction those committing adultery with her, unless they repent of their works.

23. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches will know that I am the One searching the inner parts and hearts. And I will give to each of you according to your works.

24. But I say to you and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, and who did not know the deep things of Satan, as they say: I am not casting another burden on you;

25. but what you have, hold until I shall come.

26. And the one overcoming, and the one keeping My works until the end, "I will give to him authority over the nations,"

27. and "he will shepherd them with an iron staff" (they are "broken to pieces like clay vessels"), as I also have received from My Father. Psa. 2:8, 9

28. And I will give to him the morning star.

29. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.  

## Revelation 3

1. And to the angel of the church in Sardis, write: These things says the One having the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have the name that you live, and are dead.

2. Be watching, and establish the things left, which are about to die. For I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.

3. Then remember how you received and heard, and keep, and repent. If, then, you do not watch, I will come upon you like a thief and you will not at all know what hour I come upon you.

4. You also have a few names in Sardis which did not defile their robes, and they shall walk with Me in white because they are worthy.

5. The one overcoming, this one shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not at all blot his name out of the Book of Life; and I will acknowledge his name before My Father, and before His angels.

6. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.   

7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write: These things says the Holy One, the True One, the One having "the key of David," "the One opening, and no one shuts; and shuts, and no one opens:" Isa. 22:22

8. I know your works. Behold, I have given a door being opened before you, and no one is able to shut it, for you have a little power and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.

9. Behold, I give out of the synagogue of Satan those saying themselves to be Jews, and they are not, but they lie. Behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they shall know that I loved you.

10. Because you kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is going to come on all the habitable world in order to try those dwelling on the earth.

11. Behold, I am coming quickly. Hold what you have that no one take your crown.

12. The one overcoming, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall not go out any more. And I will write the name of My God on him, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem which comes down out of Heaven from My God, and My new name.

13. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.   

14. And to the angel of the church of Laodicea, write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Head of the creation of God:

15. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold, or hot.

16. So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth.

17. Because you say, I am rich, and I am made rich, and I have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.

18. I advise you to buy from Me gold having been fired by fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, and your shame and nakedness may not be revealed. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.

19. I, as many "as I love, I rebuke and I chasten." Be zealous, then, and repent. Prov. 3:12

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock: If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will enter to him, and I will dine with him, and he with Me.

21. The one overcoming, I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father in His throne.

22. The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.  

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I saw. And behold, a door being opened in Heaven! And I heard the first voice as a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what needs to happen after these things.

2. And at once I became in spirit. And, behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and One sitting on the throne.

3. And the One sitting was in appearance like a jasper stone, and a sardius; and a rainbow was around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.

4. And around the throne I saw twenty four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty four elders sitting, having been clothed in white garments. And they had golden crowns on their heads.

5. And out of the throne come forth lightnings and thunders and voices. And seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;

6. and a glassy sea before the throne, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.

7. And the first living creature was like a lion; and the second living creature like a calf; and the third living creature having a face like a man; and the fourth living creature like an eagle flying.   

8. And the four living creatures each one had six wings around, and within being full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty," the One who was, and is, and is coming!  Isa. 6:3

9. And when ever the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One living forever and ever,

10. the twenty four elders fall down before Him sitting on the throne; and they will worship the One living forever and ever, and will throw their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. Lord, You are worthy to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because You created all things, and through Your will they exist and were created.  

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw on the right of the One sitting on the throne a scroll having been written within and on the back, having been sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice: Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loosen its seals?

3. And no one in Heaven was able to open the scroll nor to see it, neither on the earth, nor underneath the earth.

4. And I wept much, because no one worthy was found to open and to read the scroll, nor to see it.

5. And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep, Behold, the Lion being of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, overcame so as to open the scroll, and to loose its seven seals.   

6. And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, was a Lamb standing, as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, having been sent out into all the earth.

7. And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne.

8. And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having harps, and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy are You to receive the scroll, and to open its seals, because You were slain, and by Your blood purchased us to God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,

10. and made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign over the earth.

11. And I saw, and I heard a sound of many angels around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders, and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,

12. saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb having been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.

13. And every creature which is in Heaven, and in the earth, and underneath the earth, and the things that are on the sea, and the things in all of them, I heard saying: To Him sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.

14. And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty four elders fell down and worshiped the One living forever and ever.  

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals. And I heard one of the four living creatures, like a sound of thunder, saying, Come and see.

2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse! And the one sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went out overcoming, and that he might overcome.   

3. And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.

4. And another horse went out, red. And it was given to the one sitting on it to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another. And a great sword was given to him.

5. And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and the one sitting on it having a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.

7. And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.

8. And I saw, and behold, a pale green horse, and the name of the one sitting on it was Death; and Hades followed after him. And authority was given to them to kill over the fourth of the earth with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.   

9. And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those having been slain for the word of God, and for the witness which they had.

10. And they cried with a great voice, saying, Until when, holy and true Master, do You not judge and take vengeance for our blood, from those dwelling on the earth?

11. And there was given to each one a white robe. And it was said to them that they should rest yet a little time, until might be fulfilled also the number of their fellow-slaves and their brothers, those being about to be killed, even as they.

12. And I saw when He opened the sixth seal. And behold, a great earthquake occurred. And the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair; and the moon became as blood;

13. and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree being shaken by a great wind casts its unripe figs.

14. And the heaven departed like a scroll being rolled up. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the rich ones, and the commanders, and the powerful ones, and every slave, and every freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.

16. And "they said to the mountains" and to the rocks, "Fall on us," and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, Hos. 10:8

17. because the great day of His wrath has come; and who is able to stand?  

## Revelation 7

1. And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on every tree.

2. And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God. And he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to them to harm the earth and the sea, saying,

3. Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we seal the slaves of our God on their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of those having been sealed: one hundred forty four thousands, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:

5. Out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand having been sealed.

6. Out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand having been sealed.

7. Out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand having been sealed.

8. Out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand having been sealed. Out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand having been sealed.

9. After these things I saw, and behold, a great crowd which no one was able to number them, out of every nation, even tribes and peoples and tongues standing in front of the throne, and before the Lamb, having been clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.

10. And they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation to our God sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb.

11. And all the angels and of the elders and of the four living creatures stood around the throne. And they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God,

12. saying, Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength to our God forever and ever. Amen.   

13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These, the ones having been clothed in the white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?

14. And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are those coming out of the great tribulation; and they washed their robes and whitened them in the blood of the Lamb.

15. Because of this they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His sanctuary. And He sitting on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.

16. And they will not hunger still, nor will they thirst still, nor at all shall fall on them the sun, nor any kind of heat.

17. Because the Lamb in the midst of the throne will shepherd them, and will lead them on the living fountains of waters; and God will wipe off every tear from their eyes.  

## Revelation 8

1. And when He opened the seventh seal, a silence occurred in Heaven, about a half hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

3. And another angel came and stood on the altar, having a golden censer. And many incenses were given to him, that he give them with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incenses went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God.

5. And the angel has taken the censer, and has filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth; and sounds and thunders and lightnings and earthquakes occurred.

6. And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves, that they might trumpet.   

7. And the first angel trumpeted. And hail and fire mixed with blood occurred. And it was cast onto the earth; and the third part of the trees was burned down; and all green grass was burned down.

8. And the second angel trumpeted. And as a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood;

9. and the third part of the creatures having souls died in the sea; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.

10. And the third angel trumpeted. And a great burning star, like a lamp, fell out of the heaven. And it fell onto the third part of the rivers, and onto the fountains of waters.

11. And the name of the star is said to be Wormwood. And the third part of the waters became changed into wormwood. And many men died from the waters, because they were bitter.

12. And the fourth angel trumpeted. And the third part of the sun, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, was struck, that the third part of them might be darkened, and the third part of the day might not appear; and in the same way the night.

13. And I saw, and I heard one angel flying in mid-heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe! Woe! Woe to those dwelling on the earth, from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three angels being about to trumpet!  

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel trumpeted. And I saw a star out of the heaven falling onto the earth. And the key to the pit of the abyss was given to it.

2. And he opened the pit of the abyss. And smoke went up out of the pit, like smoke of a great furnace. And the sun was darkened, and the air, by the smoke of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke locusts came forth to the earth. And authority was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have authority.

4. And it was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth, nor every green thing, nor every tree, except only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.

5. And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they be tormented five months. And their torment is as the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.

6. And in those days men will seek death, and they will not find it. And they will long to die, yet death will flee from them.

7. And the likenesses of the locusts were like horses having been prepared for war; and on their heads as crowns, like gold; and their faces like the faces of men.

8. And they had hairs like the hairs of women; and their teeth were like those of lions.

9. And they had breastplates like iron breastplates; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running to war.

10. And they have tails like scorpions, and their stings were in their tails; and their authority is to harm men five months.

11. And they have a king over them, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name was Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.

12. The first woe has departed; behold, after these things come two woes.   

13. And the sixth angel trumpeted. And I heard one voice out of the four horns of the golden altar before God,

14. saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels, those having been bound at the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were released, those having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.

16. And the number of the armies of the cavalry was two myriads of myriads; and I heard their number.

17. And so I saw in the vision the horses, and those sitting on them, having fire-colored breastplates, even dusky red and brimstone-like; and the heads of the horses as heads of lions; and out of their mouths come fire and smoke and brimstone.

18. By these three were killed the third part of men, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone coming out of their mouths.

19. For their authority is in their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails are like snakes, having heads, and they do harm with them.

20. And the rest of men, those not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they will not worship demons, and "golden idols, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wooden idols, which neither are able to see, nor to hear," nor to walk. Dan. 5:23; Psa. 115:4 -7; 135:15-17

21. And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.  

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another strong angel coming down out of the heaven, having been clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on the head; and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.

2. And he had in his hand a little scroll having been opened. And he placed his right foot on the sea, and the left on the land,

3. and cried with a great voice, as a lion roars. And when he cried, the seven thunders spoke their sounds.

4. And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write. And I heard a voice out of Heaven saying to me, Seal what things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write these things.

5. And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his hand to Heaven,

6. and swore by Him living forever and ever, "who created the heaven" and the things in it, "and the earth" and the things in it, "and the sea and the things in it," that time shall no longer be; Ex. 20:11

7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to trumpet, was even ended the mystery of God, as He preached to His slaves, the prophets.   

8. And the voice which I heard out of Heaven was again speaking to me, and saying, Go, take the little scroll having been opened in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.

9. And I went away toward the angel, saying to him, Give the little scroll to me. And he said to me, Take and eat it up, and it will make your belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in your mouth.

10. And I took the little scroll out of the angel's hand, and devoured it. And it was sweet like honey in my mouth; and when I ate it, my belly was made bitter.

11. And he said to me, You must again prophesy before peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.  

## Revelation 11

1. And a reed like a staff was given to me, and the angel stood, saying, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those worshiping in it.

2. And cast aside the outside court of the temple, and do not measure it. For it was given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city forty two months.   

3. And I will give to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, dressed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands, standing before the God of the earth.

5. And if anyone desires to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, so it is right for him to be killed.

6. These have the authority to shut up the heaven, that no rain may rain in the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.

7. And when they complete their witness, the beast coming up out of the abyss will make war with them, and will overcome them, and will kill them.

8. And their bodies will be on the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom, and Egypt, where our Lord was crucified.

9. And some from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three days and a half; and they do not allow their dead bodies to be put in tombs.

10. And those living on the earth will rejoice over them, and will make merry. And they will send one another gifts, because these two prophets tormented those living on the earth.

11. And after three days and a half, a spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. And great fear fell on the ones beholding them.

12. And they heard a great voice out of Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into the heaven in the cloud. And their enemies saw them.

13. And in that hour a great earthquake occurred, and the tenth part of the city fell. And there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand names of men. And the rest became terrified, and gave glory to the God of Heaven.   

14. The second woe departed. And, behold, the third woe is coming quickly.

15. And the seventh angel trumpeted. And there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world became our Lord's, even of His Christ; and He shall reign forever and ever.

16. And the twenty four elders sitting before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God,

17. saying, We thank You, Lord God Almighty, the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, because You took Your great power and reigned.

18. And the nations were full of wrath; and Your wrath came, and the time of the judging of the dead, and to give the reward to Your slaves, to the prophets, and to the saints, and to the ones fearing Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those destroying the earth.

19. And the temple of God in Heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple, and lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and earthquake, and a great hail occurred.  

## Revelation 12

1. And a great sign was seen in the heavens, a woman having been clothed with the sun, and the moon was underneath her feet; and on her head a crown of twelve stars;

2. and having a babe in womb. She cries, being in labor, and having been distressed to bear.

3. And another sign was seen in the heavens. And, behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns! And on his heads were seven diadems,

4. and his tail drew the third part of the stars of the heaven, and he throws them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman being about to bear, so that when she bears he might devour her child.

5. And she bore a son, a male, who is going to shepherd all the nations with an iron staff. And her child was caught away to God, and to His throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place, it having been prepared from God, that there they might nourish her a thousand two hundred and sixty days.

7. And war occurred in Heaven, Michael and his angels making war against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels made war,

8. but they did not have strength, nor yet was place found for them in Heaven.

9. And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent being called Devil, and, Satan; he deceiving the whole habitable world was cast out onto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a great voice saying in Heaven, Now has come the salvation and power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because the accuser of our brothers is thrown down, the one accusing them before our God day and night.

11. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony. And they did not love their soul even until death.   

12. Because of this, be glad, the heavens and those tabernacling in them. Woe to the ones dwelling on the earth, and in the sea, because the Devil came down to you having great anger, knowing that he has a little time!

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast out onto the earth, he pursued the woman who bore the male.

14. And two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, away from the serpent's face.

15. And the serpent threw water out of his mouth like a river after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried off by the river.

16. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon threw out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was enraged over the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commandments of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ.  

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten diadems, and on its heads names of blasphemy.

2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as a lion's mouth. And the dragon gave its power to it, and its throne, and great authority.

3. And I saw one of its heads, as having been slain to death, and its deadly wound was healed. And all the earth marveled after the beast.

4. And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast; who is able to make war with it?

5. And a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies was given to it. And authority to act forty two months was given to it.

6. And it opened its mouth in blasphemy toward God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those tabernacling in Heaven.

7. And it was given to it "to war with the saints, and to overcome them." And authority was given to it over every tribe and tongue and nation. Dan. 7:21

8. And all those dwelling in the earth will worship it, those of whom the names had not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb having been slain from the foundation of the world.

9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

10. If anyone gathers captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone will kill by a sword, by a sword he must be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.   

11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. And it had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon.

12. And it executes all the authority of the first beast before it. And it causes that the earth and those dwelling in it should worship the first beast, of which was healed its deadly wound.

13. And it does great signs, that even fire it causes to come down out of the heaven onto the earth before men.

14. And it deceives those dwelling on the earth, because of the signs which were given to it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast who has the wound of the sword, and lived.

15. And was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak, and might cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.

16. And the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, it causes that they give to them all a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads,

17. even that not any could buy or sell, except the one having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name.

18. Here is wisdom: Let the one having reason count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man and its number is six hundred and sixty six.  

## Revelation 14

1. And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion! And with Him were a hundred and forty four thousands, with the name of His Father having been written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a sound out of Heaven, as a sound of many waters, and as a sound of great thunder. Also I heard a sound of harpers harping on their harps.

3. And they sing as a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty four thousands, those having been redeemed from the earth.

4. These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones following the Lamb wherever He may go. These were redeemed from among men as a firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.

5. And no guile was found in their mouth, for they are without blemish before the throne of God.   

6. And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an everlasting gospel to proclaim to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,

7. saying in a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him, because the hour of His judgment has come; also, Worship "Him who has made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea," and the fountains of waters. Ex. 20:11

8. And another angel followed, saying, The great city, Babylon, has fallen, has fallen; because of the wine of the anger of her fornication, she made all nations to drink.

9. And a third angel followed them, saying in a great voice, If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or in his hand,

10. he also shall drink of the wine of the anger of God having been mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented by fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. And those worshiping the beast and its image have no rest night and day, even if anyone receives the mark of its name.

12. Here is the patience of the saints; here are the ones keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.   

13. And I heard a voice out of Heaven saying to me, Write: Blessed are the dead, the ones dying in the Lord from now. Yes, says the Spirit, they shall rest from their labors, and their works follow with them.

14. And I saw; and behold, a white cloud and on the cloud One sitting, like the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.

15. And another angel went forth out of the temple, crying in a great voice to the One sitting on the cloud, Send Your sickle and reap, because Your hour to reap came, because the harvest of the earth was dried.

16. And the One sitting on the cloud thrust His sickle onto the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel went forth out of the temple in Heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel went forth out of the altar having authority over the fire. And he spoke with a great cry to the one having the sharp sickle, saying, Send your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because its grapes are ripened.

19. And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw into the winepress of the great anger of God.

20. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood went out of the winepress as far as the bridles of the horses, from a thousand six hundred stadia.  

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in Heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the last seven plagues, because the anger of God was completed in them.

2. And I saw, as a glassy sea having been mixed with fire. And the ones overcoming the beast, and its image, and its mark, of the number of its name, were standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.

3. And they sing the song of Moses the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty, righteous and true are Your ways, King of the saints.

4. Who will not fear You, Lord, and glorify Your name? For You only are holy. For all the nations will come and will worship before You, because Your righteousnesses were made known.   

5. And after these things I saw; and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in Heaven was opened!

6. And the seven angels having the seven plagues came forth out of the temple, having been clothed in clean and bright linen, and golden bands having been girded around the breasts.

7. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of God living forever and ever.

8. And the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God, and with His power. And no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels should be completed.  

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels: Go and pour out the bowls of the anger of God onto the earth.

2. And the first went away and poured out his bowl onto the earth. And it became a bad and evil sore onto the men, the ones having the mark of the beast, and the ones worshiping its image.

3. And the second angel poured out his bowl onto the sea. And it became blood, as of a dead one, and every soul of life died in the sea.

4. And the third angel poured out his bowl onto the rivers, and onto the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, You are righteous, Lord, the One who is, and who was, and who will be, because You judged these things,

6. since they poured out the blood of the saints and of the prophets; and You gave blood to them to drink, for they were deserving.

7. And I heard another out of the altar saying, Yes, Lord God Almighty, Your judgments are true and righteous.   

8. And the fourth angel poured out his bowl onto the sun. And it was given to him to burn men with fire.

9. And men were burned with great heat. And they blasphemed the name of God, the One having authority over these plagues and they did not repent to give Him glory.

10. And the fifth angel poured out his bowl onto the throne of the beast. And its kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues from the pain.

11. And they blasphemed the God of Heaven, from their pains and from their sores. And they did not repent of their works.   

12. And the sixth angel poured out his bowl onto the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up so that might be prepared the way of the kings from the rising of the sun.

13. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

14. For they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the earth, even of the whole habitable world to assemble them to the war of that day, the great day of God Almighty.

15. Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is the one watching and keeping his garments, that he does not walk naked, and they may see his shame.

16. And He assembled them in the place having been called in Hebrew, Armageddon.   

17. And the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a great voice came from the throne from the temple of Heaven, saying, It has happened!

18. And voices and thunders and lightnings occurred. And a great earthquake occurred, such as did not occur since man came into being on the earth, such a huge earthquake, so great!

19. And the great city came to be into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the anger of His wrath.

20. And every island fled away, and mountains were not found.

21. And a great hail, as the size of a talent, came down out of the heaven upon men. And men blasphemed God from the plague of the hail, because its plague is exceedingly great.  

## Revelation 17

1. And one of the seven angels having the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying to me, Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot sitting on the many waters,

2. with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the ones inhabiting the earth became drunk from the wine of her fornication.

3. And he carried me away into a desert, by the Spirit. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and being gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominations and unclean things of her fornication.

5. And on her forehead was a name having been written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth.

6. And I saw the woman being drunk from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled, seeing her with a great marveling.   

7. And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast supporting her, the one having the seven heads and the ten horns.

8. The beast which you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss, and goes to perdition. And those dwelling on the earth will marvel, the ones whose names have not been written on the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast, that it was a thing, and is not, yet now is.

9. Here is the mind having wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sits on them.

10. And the kings are seven. The five fell, and the one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he does come, he must remain a little.

11. And the beast which was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to perdition.

12. And the ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but will receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.

13. These have one mind, and their power and authority they shall give up to the beast.   

14. These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and the ones with Him are the called and elect and faithful ones.

15. And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolated and naked. And they will eat her flesh, and will burn her down with fire.

17. For God gave into their hearts to do His mind, and to act in one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

18. And the woman whom you saw is the great city, having a kingdom over the kings of the earth.  

## Revelation 18

1. And after these things I saw another angel coming down out of Heaven having great authority, and the earth was lighted up from his glory.

2. And he cried in a strong, great voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen! It has fallen, and it has become a dwelling-place of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean bird, even having been hated,

3. because of the wine of the anger of her fornication which all the nations have drunk, even the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her; and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her luxury.

4. And I heard another voice out of Heaven saying, My people, come out of her, that you may not share in her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues;

5. because her sins joined together, even up to Heaven, and God remembered her unjust deeds.

6. Give back to her as also she gave back to you, and double to her double, according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.

7. By what things she glorified herself, and luxuriated, by so much give back to her torment and mourning. Because she says in her heart, I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow; and I do not see mourning at all.

8. Because of this, in one day her plagues shall come: death, and mourning, and famine; and she will be consumed with fire, for the Lord God judging her is strong.   

9. And the kings of the earth will weep for her, and will wail over her, those having fornicated and having luxuriated with her, when they see the smoke of her burning;

10. standing from afar because of the fear of her torment, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment came.

11. And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any more,

12. cargo of gold, and silver, and of precious stone, and of pearls, and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of very precious wood, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble,

13. and cinnamon, and incenses, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine meal, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and of bodies and souls of men.

14. And the ripe fruits of the lust of your soul went away from you, and all the fat things, and the bright things went away from you, and you will find them no more, not at all.

15. The merchants of these things, the ones being enriched from her, will stand from afar because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;

16. and saying, Woe! Woe to the great city having been clothed in linen and purple and scarlet, and having been gilded with gold and precious stone, and pearls!

17. For in one hour such great wealth was desolated. And every ship-pilot and all company on the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood from afar,

18. and cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like the great city?

19. And they threw dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, by which all those having ships in the sea were rich, from her costliness, because in one hour she was ruined.

20. Rejoice over her, Heaven, and the holy apostles, and the prophets, because God judged your judgment on her.

21. And one strong angel lifted a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying, This way, on a violent impulse, Babylon the great city will be thrown down, and it will never more still be found.

22. And the sound of harpers, and of musicians, and flutists, and of trumpeters will never more be heard in you. And every craftsman of every craft will never more be found in you. And the sound of a mill will never more be heard in you.

23. And the light of a lamp will never more shine in you. And the voice of the bridegroom and bride will never more be heard in you. For your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were misled.

24. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all the ones having been slain on the earth.  

## Revelation 19

1. And after these things, I heard a great voice of a numerous crowd in Heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the honor and the power of the Lord our God!

2. For true and righteous are His judgments, because He judged the great harlot who defiled the earth with her fornication. And He avenged the blood of His slaves out of her hand.

3. And secondly they said, Hallelujah! Also her smoke goes up forever and ever.

4. And the twenty four elders, and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God sitting on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!   

5. And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves, and the ones fearing Him, the small and the great.

6. And I heard as a sound of a numerous crowd, and as a sound of many waters, and as a sound of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah! Because the Lord God Almighty reigned.

7. Let us rejoice and let us exult, and we will give glory to Him, because the marriage of the Lamb came, and His wife prepared herself.

8. And it was given to her that she be clothed in fine linen, pure and bright; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.

9. And he says to me, Write: Blessed are the ones having been called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he says to me, These words of God are true.

10. And I fell before his feet to worship him, but he said to me, Behold! Stop! I am a fellow-slave of yours, and of your brothers, having the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.   

11. And I saw Heaven being opened. And, behold! A white horse, and He sitting on it having been called Faithful and True. And He judges and wars in righteousness.

12. And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head many diadems, having a name that had been written, which no one knows except Himself;

13. and having been clothed in a garment which had been dipped in blood. And His name is called The Word of God.

14. And the armies in Heaven followed Him on white horses, being dressed in fine linen, white and pure.

15. And out of His mouth goes forth a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations. And He will shepherd them with an iron rod. And He treads the winepress of the wine of the anger and of the wrath of God Almighty.

16. And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name having been written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

17. And I saw one angel standing in the sun. And he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in mid-heaven, Come and gather together to the supper of the great God,

18. that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of strong ones, and the flesh of horses, and of the ones sitting on them, and the flesh of all, both freemen and slaves, even of the small and great.

19. And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth, and their armies being assembled to make war with the One sitting on the horse, and with His army.

20. And the beast was seized, and with this one the false prophet doing signs before it, by which he led astray those having received the mark of the beast, and those worshiping its image. The two were thrown alive into the Lake of Fire burning with brimstone.

21. And the rest were killed with the sword of the One sitting on the horse, it having gone out of His mouth. And all the birds were filled from their flesh.  

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel coming down out of Heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain on his hand.

2. And he laid hold of the dragon, the old serpent who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

3. and threw him into the abyss, and shut him up, and sealed over him, that he should not still lead astray the nations, until the thousand years are fulfilled. And after these things, he must be set loose a little time.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them. And judgment was given to them, and the souls of the ones having been beheaded because of the witness of Jesus, and because of the Word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast nor its image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

5. But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy is the one having part in the first resurrection. The second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him a thousand years.

7. And whenever the thousand years are ended, Satan will be set loose out of his prison,

8. and he will go to mislead the nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to assemble them in war, whose number is as the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up over the breadth of the land and encircled the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. And fire from God came down out of Heaven and burned them down.

10. And the Devil leading them astray was thrown into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet were . And they were tormented day and night forever and ever.   

11. And I saw a great white throne, and the One sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled; and a place was not found for them.

12. And I saw the dead, the small and the great, standing before God. And books were opened. And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead in it. And death and Hades gave up the dead in them. And they were each judged according to their works.

14. And death and Hades were thrown into the Lake of Fire. This is the second death.

15. And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the Lake of Fire.  

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea no longer is.

2. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God, having been prepared as a bride, having been adorned for her Husband.

3. And I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God with men! And He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God.

4. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And death shall be no longer, nor mourning, nor outcry, nor pain will be any longer; for the first things passed away.

5. And the One sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He says to me, Write, because these words are faithful and true.

6. And He said to me, It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending. To the one thirsting, I will freely give of the fountain of the water of life.

7. The one overcoming will inherit all things, and I will be God to him, and he will be the son to Me.

8. But for the cowardly and unbelieving, and those having become foul, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the lying ones, their part will be in the Lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.   

9. And one of the seven angels came to me, he having the seven bowls being filled with the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.

10. And he carried me in spirit on to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, holy Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God,

11. having the glory of God. And its light was like a very precious stone, as a jasper stone, being clear as crystal,

12. and having a great and high wall, having twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates and names having been inscribed, which are of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. From the east, three gates; from the north, three gates; from the south, three gates; and from the west, three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.

16. And the city lies four cornered, even its length as much as the width also. And he measured the city with the reed at twelve thousand stadia; its length and width and height are equal.

17. And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty four cubits, a measure of a man, which is of an angel.

18. And the structure of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like pure glass.

19. And the foundation of the wall of the city having been adorned with every precious stone: The first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

20. the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; respectively each one of the gates was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, even the Lamb.

23. And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they might shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, even its lamp is the Lamb.

24. And the nations of the ones saved will walk in its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.

25. And its gates may not at all be shut by day, for no night will be there.

26. And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.

27. And all profaning may not at all enter into it, or any making an abomination or a lie; but only the ones having been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb.  

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, coming forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

2. In the midst of its street and of the river, from here and from there, was a tree of life producing twelve fruits: according to one month each yielding its fruit. And the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations.

3. And every curse will no longer be. And the throne of God and the Lamb will be in it; and His slaves will serve Him.

4. And they will see His face; and His name will be on their foreheads.

5. And night will not be there; and they have no need of a lamp or a light of the sun, because the Lord God will shed light on them. And they shall reign forever and ever.   

6. And he said to me, These words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His slaves what must happen quickly.

7. Behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one keeping the words of the prophecy of this Book.

8. And I, John, was the one seeing and hearing these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel showing me these things.

9. And he said to me, Behold! Stop! For I am your fellow-slave, and of your brothers the prophets, and of the ones keeping the words of this Book. Do worship to God.

10. And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this Book, because the time is near.

11. The one acting unjustly, let him still act unjustly; and the filthy, let him still be filthy; and the righteous, let him still do righteousness; and the holy, let him still be holy.

12. And, behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to each as his work is.

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.

14. Blessed are the ones doing His commands, that their authority will be over the Tree of Life, and by the gates they may enter into the city.

15. But outside are the dogs and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone loving a lie, and making it.

16. I, Jesus, sent My angel to testify these things to you over the churches. I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright and morning Star.

17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And the one hearing, let him say, Come! And the one thirsting, let him come; and the one desiring, let him take of the water of life freely.

18. For I testify together with everyone hearing the words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add upon him the plagues having been written in this Book.

19. And if anyone takes away from the words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and of the things having been written in this Book.   

20. The One testifying these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly. Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus!

21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
