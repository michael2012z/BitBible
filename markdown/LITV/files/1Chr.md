19. and said, Far be it from me by my God, to do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men with their lives? For they have brought it with their lives. And he was not willing to drink it. The three mighty ones did these things.

18. And the Spirit enwrapped Amasai, the head of the thirty: To you, O David, and with you, O son of Jesse, peace! Peace to you, and peace to your helpers, for your God has helped you. And David received them, and put them among the heads of the band.

19. And some from Manasseh fell to David as he came with the Philistines to battle against Saul. And they did not help them, for by counsel the rulers of the Philistines sent them away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul with our heads.

20. As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him from Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, heads of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

21. And they helped David against the raiding band, for they all were valiant warriors; and they were commanders in the army;

22. for at the time they came daily to David, to help him, until it was a great army, like an army of God.   

23. And these were the numbers of the heads of those that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the mouth of Jehovah.

24. The sons of Judah, bearing shield and spear, were six thousand, eight hundred, armed for war.

25. Of the sons of Simeon, mighty ones of valor for the war, seven thousand, one hundred.

26. Of the sons of Levi were four thousand, six hundred.

27. And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites and with him three thousand, seven hundred;

28. and Zadok, a young man mighty in valor; and of the house of his father were twenty two leaders.

29. And of the sons of Benjamin, Saul's brothers, were three thousand. For before, the most of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.

30. And of the sons of Ephraim were twenty thousand, eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men to the house of their fathers.

31. And of the half tribe of Manasseh were eighteen thousand who were designated by name, to come to make David king.

32. And of the sons of Issachar, having understanding of the times, to know what Israel should do. Their heads were two hundred, and all their brothers were at their mouth.

33. Of Zebulun, going forth to the army, that could set the battle in array with all kinds of weapons of war, fifty thousand; and keeping rank without a double heart.

34. And of Naphtali, a thousand chiefs; and with them with shield and spear were thirty seven thousand.

35. And of the Danites arraying the battle were twenty eight thousand, six hundred.

36. And of Asher, going out to the army to set in order the battle were forty thousand.

37. And from beyond the Jordan: of the Reubenites, and of the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all of the weapons of war for battle were a hundred and twenty thousand

38. All these were men of war, keeping rank; they came to Hebron with a perfect heart, to make David king over all Israel. And also all the rest of Israel was of one heart, to make David king.

39. And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking. For their brothers had prepared for them.

40. And also those near to them, to Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought in bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen; food of fine flour, fig cakes, and raisin cakes, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep, to great plenty. For joy was in Israel.  

## 1 Chronicles 13

1. And David consulted the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, to every leader.

2. And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it is good to you, and it has broken forth from Jehovah our God, we shall send to our brothers those remaining in all the lands of Israel, and with them the priests and the Levites in the cities of their open lands; and they shall be gathered to us.

3. And we shall bring around to us the ark of our God, for we did not seek Him in the days of Saul.

4. And all the congregation said to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

5. And David gathered all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entering in of Hamath, to bring in the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.

6. And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath-jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Jehovah God, who dwells among the cherubs, where the Name was called on.

7. And they made the ark of God to ride on a new cart from the house of Abinadab. And Uzza and Ahio were leading the cart.

8. And David and all Israel were playing before God with all their might, and with songs, and with lyres, and with harps, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.   

9. And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, then Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.

10. And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzza, and He struck him, because he had put out his hand on the ark:; and he died there before God.

11. And it burned to David, for Jehovah had broken a breach against Uzza; and he called that place, The Breach of Uzza to this day.

12. And David feared God on that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?

13. And David did not bring the ark to himself, to the City of David, but carried it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

14. And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he had.  

## 1 Chronicles 14

1. And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him.

2. And David saw that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted to a height, for the sake of His people Israel.

3. And David again took wives in Jerusalem. And David again fathered sons and daughters.

4. And these were the names of the children who were to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

5. and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

6. and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

7. and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.   

8. And the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel. And all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard, and went out before them.

9. And the Philistines came and made a raid in the Valley of the Giants.

10. And David asked of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines; and, Have You given them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, and I will give them into your hand.

11. And they went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breaking of the waters; so they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

12. And they left their gods there. And David commanded, and they were burned with fire.

13. And yet again the Philistines raided in the valley.

14. And David again inquired of God. And God spoke to him, You shall not go up after them; turn away from them and come to them across from the weeping trees.

15. And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the weeping trees, then you shall go out in the battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.

16. And David did as God commanded him. And they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

17. And the name of David went out into all the lands; and Jehovah put the dread of him on all the nations.  

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. And he built houses for himself in the City of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and stretched out a tent for it.

2. Then David said, None should bear the ark of God except the Levites, for Jehovah had chosen them to bear the ark of God, and to serve Him forever.

3. And David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had prepared for it.

4. And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites.

5. Of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and twenty.

6. Of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers, two hundred and twenty.

7. Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and thirty.

9. Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers, eighty.

10. Of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers, a hundred and twelve.

11. And David called to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, and to the Levites, to Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

12. and said to them, You are the heads of your fathers of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brothers, and you shall bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.

13. Because you did not do so at the first, Jehovah our God broke in against us, for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance.

14. And the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.

15. And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God, as Moses commanded, according to the word of Jehovah, by staves above on the shoulders.

16. And David commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers with instruments of song, psalteries, and harps, and sounding cymbals, to lift up the voice with joy.

17. And the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah.

18. And with them were their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.

19. And the singers were Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, to sound with cymbals of bronze;

20. and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with harps set to Alamoth;

21. and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah with lyres on the octave, to oversee.

22. And Chenaniah the chief of the Levites led in the song, instructing in the song, because he was skillful.

23. And Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.

24. And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were blowing with the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obededom and Jehiah were gatekeepers for the ark.   

25. And it was David, and the elders of Israel, and the commanders of the thousands, who were going to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obededom with joy.

26. And it happened, as God helped the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.

27. And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, the master of the song with the singers. David also had an ephod of linen on him.

28. And all Israel was bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and cymbals, sounding aloud with lyres and harps.

29. And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out through the window and saw king David dancing and making merry. And she despised him in her heart.  

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. And they brought in the ark of God, and set it down in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.

2. And when David finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, and he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah;

3. even he passed out to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to each a loaf of bread, a portion, and a raisin cake.

4. And he set before the ark of Jehovah ministers from the Levites, even to celebrate and to thank and to give praise to Jehovah the God of Israel:

5. Asaph the head, and Zechariah his second; Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of harps, and with lyres; and Asaph was sounding with the cymbals.

6. And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were continually with trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God.   

7. Then on that day David first gave by the hand of Asaph and his brothers to give thanks to Jehovah.

8. O give thanks to Jehovah; call on His name; make known His deeds among the peoples.

9. Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him; tell of all His marvelous works.

10. Glory in His holy name; let the heart of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

11. Seek Jehovah and His strength, seek His face continually.

12. Remember His wonders that He has done, His signs, and the judgments of His mouth,

13. O seed of Israel, His servant; O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.

14. He is Jehovah our God, His judgments are in all the earth.

15. Remember His covenant forever, the word He gave to a thousand generations,

16. which He has made with Abraham, and His oath to Isaac;

17. and He established it to Jacob for a statute, to Israel as a covenant forever,

18. saying, I will give you the land of Canaan, the allotment of your inheritance;

19. when you were few in number, even very few, and sojourners in it,

20. and they went up and down, from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.

21. He has not allowed any to oppress them; yea, for their sake He has reproved kings:

22. Touch not My anointed ones, and do My prophets no evil.

23. Sing to Jehovah, all the earth, proclaim His salvation from day to day.

24. Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all the peoples.

25. For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; and He is to be feared above all gods.

26. all gods of the peoples are nothings; yea, Jehovah has made the heavens.

27. Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and gladness are in His place.

28. Give to Jehovah, O kindred of the people, give to Jehovah glory and strength.

29. Give to Jehovah the glory of His name; bring an offering and come before Him; worship Jehovah in the adornment of holiness.

30. Tremble before Him, all the earth; yea, the earth is established, it shall not be moved!

31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; and let them say among nations, Jehovah reigns.

32. Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it; let the fields rejoice, and all in them.

33. Then the trees of the forest will sing out before Jehovah, for He has come to judge the earth.

34. Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy endures forever.

35. And say, O save us, God of our salvation; and gather us, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.

36. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and gave praise to Jehovah.   

37. And he left there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, for Asaph and for his brothers, to minister before the ark continually to the matter of a day in its day;

38. also, Obed-edom and their brothers, sixty eight; and Obededom the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, as gatekeepers;

39. and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, in the high place that was in Gibeon;

40. to offer the burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of the burnt offering continually, to the morning, and to evening, even to all that was written in the law of Jehovah, which He commanded Israel;

41. and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because His mercy endures forever;

42. and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those making a sound, and instruments of the song of God; and the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate.

43. And all the people departed, each to his house; and David returned to bless his house.  

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. And it happened, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I am living in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under curtains.

2. And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.

3. And it happened on that night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

4. Go, and you shall say to My servant David, So says Jehovah, You shall not build a house for Me to dwell in;

5. for I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought Israel up until this day, but I have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another .

6. Wherever I have walked up and down among all Israel, have I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have you not built a house of cedars for Me?

7. And now you shall say this to My servant, to David, So says Jehovah of hosts, I have taken you from the pasture from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel;

8. and I have been with you wherever you have walked; and I have cut off all your enemies from before you; and have made for you a name like the name of the great ones in the earth.

9. And I will prepare a place for My people Israel, and he will plant, and he will dwell in his place, and shall not be made to tremble any more; nor shall the sons of wickedness waste him any more, as at the first;

10. yea, even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will humble all your enemies; and I declare to you that Jehovah shall build a house for you;

11. and it shall be, when your days have been fulfilled to go away with your fathers, that I shall raise up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons, and I shall establish his kingdom.

12. He shall build a house for Me, and I shall establish his throne forever;

13. I shall be a Father to him, and he shall be a son to Me; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it away from him who was before you;

14. and I will make him stand in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his throne shall be made to stand forever.

15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.   

16. And David the king came in and sat before Jehovah, and said, Who am I, O Jehovah, and what is my house, that You have brought me thus far?

17. And this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; but You have spoken to Your servant house for a great while to come, and have looked upon me as a type of the Man who is on high, O Jehovah God!

18. What can David add still more to You concerning the honor being put on Your servant? For You know Your servant.

19. O Jehovah, for Your servant's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.

20. O Jehovah, there is none like You; and there is no God except You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

21. And what one nation in the earth is as Your people Israel, whom God has brought out to ransom to Himself for a people, to make for Yourself a great and fearful name, to cast out the nations from before Your people, whom You have ransomed out of Egypt.

22. Yea, You have chosen Your people Israel for Yourself, for a people forever, and You, O Jehovah, have been God to them.

23. And now, O Jehovah, the word that You have spoken as to Your servant, and as to his house, let it be established forever, and do as You have spoken;

24. let it even be established, and Your name be great forever, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel is God to Israel; and the house of Your servant David shall be made to stand before You;

25. For You, O my God, You have uncovered the ear of Your servant, to build a house for him; on this account Your servant has found to pray before You.

26. And now, O Jehovah, You are God Himself, and You speak this goodness concerning Your servant;

27. and now, You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, to be forever before You; for You, O Jehovah, have blessed; yea, it is blessed forever!  

## 1 Chronicles 18

9. And Tou the king of Hamath heard that David had struck the whole army of Hadarezer the king of Zobah,

10. and he sent his son Hadoram to king David, to ask peace of him, and to bless him because he had fought against Hadarezer, and had struck him; for Hadarezer had been a man of war with Tou; and he sent all vessels of gold and silver and bronze;

11. also these king David sanctified to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he had taken from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the Ammonites, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

1. And it happened after this, that king Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place.

2. And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father acted with kindness toward me; and David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites, to Hanun, to comfort him.

3. And the chiefs of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Is David honoring your father, in your eyes, because he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come in to you in order to search out and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

4. And Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut their long robes in half, to the buttocks, and sent them away.

5. And some went and told David about the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, Remain in Jericho until your beard has grown, then return.   

6. And the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves odious to David; and Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver in order to hire to themselves chariots and horsemen from Syria of Naharaim and Syria of Maachah and from Zobah.

7. And they hired thirty two thousand chariots to themselves, and the king of Maachah and his people. And they came in and pitched before Medeba; and the Ammonites had gathered out of their cities and had come to the battle.

8. And David heard, and sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.

9. And the Ammonites came out and set the battle in order at the entrance to the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.

10. And Joab saw that the face of the battle was against him before and behind; and he chose out all the choice ones in Israel, and set in order to meet Syria;

11. and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of his brother Abishai; and they set in order to meet the sons of Ammon.

12. And he said, If Syria is stronger than I, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.

13. Be strong, and we shall strengthen ourselves for our people and for the cities of our God; and Jehovah will do that which is good in His eyes.

14. And Joab and the people with him drew near before Syria to do battle; and they fled before him.

15. And the Ammonites saw that Syria had fled, and they ran away, they also, from before his brother Abishai, and went into the city. And Joab came to Jerusalem.

16. And Syria saw that they had been stricken before Israel, and sent messengers and brought out Syria that was beyond the river; and Shophach, Hadarezer's army commander, was before them.

8. These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.  

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. And Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.

2. And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring to me, and I will know their number.

3. And Joab said, May Jehovah add to His people as if they were a hundred times; my lord, O king, are they not all of them servants to my lord? Why does my lord desire this? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?

4. But the word of the king was heavy against Joab; and Joab went out and went up and down all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

5. And Joab gave the tally of the census of the people to David; and all Israel was a million and one hundred thousand men drawing sword; and Judah was four hundred and seventy thousand drawing sword.

6. And Levi and Benjamin he did not number among them, for the word of the king was loathsome to Joab.   

7. And it was evil in the eyes of God as to this thing, and He struck Israel.

8. And David said to God, I have sinned exceedingly in that I have done this thing; and now, I pray You to cause the iniquity of Your servant to pass away, for I have acted very foolishly.

9. And Jehovah spoke to Gad, the seer of David, saying,

10. Go; and you shall speak to David, saying, So says Jehovah, I am extending to you three things ; choose one of these for yourself, that I may do to you.

11. And Gad came to David and said to him, So says Jehovah, Choose for yourself:

12. either for three years of famine, or three months to be wasted before your adversaries, even to be overtaken by the sword of your enemies; or the sword of Jehovah three days, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. And now, consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent me.

13. And David said to Gad, I am in a great distress; now let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His mercies are very many; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.

14. And Jehovah sent a pestilence into Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.

15. And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. And as he was destroying, Jehovah saw, and repented as to the evil, and said to the destroying angel, Enough! Now stay your hand. And the angel of Jehovah stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

16. And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem; and David and the elders fell on their faces, covered with sackcloth.

17. And David said to God, Was it not I, I who said to number the people? Yea, it was I who sinned, and truly have done evil; and these, the flock, what have they done? O Jehovah, my God, I pray You, let Your hand be on me and on my father's house, and not on Your people, to be plagued.   

18. And the angel of Jehovah spoke to Gad, saying to David, Surely David shall go up to raise an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

19. And David went up by the word of Gad, that which he spoke in the name of Jehovah.

20. And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves; and Ornan was threshing wheat.

21. And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor and bowed down to David, with his face to the ground.

22. And David said to Ornan, Give me the site of the threshingfloor, and I will build an altar to Jehovah in it; for full silver give it to me, and the plague will be restrained from the people.

23. And Ornan said to David, Take it for yourself, and my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes; see, I have given the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the food offering; I give it all.

24. And king David said to Ornan, No, for I will surely buy it for full silver, for I will not lift up what is yours to Jehovah, so as to offer a burnt offering without cost.

25. And David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold in weight for the place.

26. And David built an altar there to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called to Jehovah; and He answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of the burnt offering.

27. And Jehovah commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.

28. At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. And the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that time in the high place in Gibeon;

30. and David was not able to go before it to seek God, for he was terrified from the face of the angel of Jehovah.  

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. And David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this altar for burnt offering for Israel.

2. And David commanded the aliens in the land of Israel to be gathered, and appointed masons to cut stones to build the house of God.

3. And David prepared iron in abundance for nails, for leaves of the gates, and for couplings and very much bronze; there was no weighing it ,

4. And also cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought in cedar trees in abundance to David.

5. And David said, My son Solomon is a youth and tender, and the house to be built to Jehovah is to be made great, to a height, for a name and for beauty to all the land; I pray You, let me prepare for it. And David prepared in abundance before his death.   

6. And he called for his son Solomon, and commanded him to build a house to Jehovah, the God of Israel.

7. And David said to his son Solomon, As for me, it has been in my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.

8. But the word of Jehovah was against me, saying, You have shed blood in abundance, and you have made great wars; you shall not build a house to My name, for you have shed much blood to the earth before Me.

9. Behold, a son shall be born to you; he shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around, for Solomon shall be his name, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days;

10. he shall build a house to My name, and he shall be a son to Me, and I a Father to him; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.

11. Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you, and may you prosper and build the house of Jehovah your God, as He spoke concerning you.

12. Only, may Jehovah give wisdom and understanding to you and command you as to Israel, even to keep the law of Jehovah your God;

13. then you shall prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the judgments that Jehovah commanded Moses as to Israel; be strong and courageous; do not fear, nor be cast down.

14. And, behold, in my affliction I have prepared a hundred thousand gold talents for the house of Jehovah, and a million talents of silver; and there is no weighing of the bronze and iron, for it is in abundance; and I have prepared wood and stones, and you shall add to them.

15. And there are many workmen with you, masons and carvers in stone, and of wood, and every skillful man for every work.

16. No number is to the gold, and to the silver, and to the bronze, and to the iron; rise up and act, for Jehovah is with you.   

17. And David commanded all the rulers of Israel to give help to his son Solomon:

18. Is not Jehovah your God with you? Yea, He has given you rest all around, for He has given into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and has subdued the land before Jehovah and before His people.

19. Now give your heart and your soul to seek to Jehovah your God, and rise up and build the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, to the house that is to be built in the name of Jehovah.  

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. And David was old, and satisfied with days, and caused his son Solomon to reign over Israel.

2. And he gathered all Israel's rulers, and the priests, and the Levites.

3. And the Levites were counted from a son of thirty years and upward; and their number by their heads, as to men, thirty eight thousand.

4. Of these, twenty four thousand to be overseers over the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges;

5. and four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand giving praise to Jehovah with instruments which I made for praising.

6. And David divided them into divisions of the sons of Levi, of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

7. Of the Gershonites: Laadan and Shimei.

8. The sons of Laadan were Jehiel the head, and Zetham, and Joel, three.

9. The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers of Laadan.

10. And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah; these four the sons of Shimei.

11. And Jahath was the head, and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons. And they were in one roster, a father's house.

12. The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was separated so that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons perpetually to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister to Him and to bless in His name perpetually.

14. And as to Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.

24. These were the sons of Levi to the house of their fathers, the heads of the fathers, to their rosters, by number of names, by their heads, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah from the son of twenty years and over.

25. For David said, Jehovah God of Israel has given rest to His people so that they may dwell in Jerusalem perpetually,

26. and also to the Levites; there was no need to carry the tabernacle nor all its vessels for its service.

27. For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from a son of twenty years and above,

28. because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of God's house,

29. both for the Bread of Arrangement, and for the fine flour for food offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for the pan, and for what is soaked in oil , and for every measure and size,

30. and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at evening.

31. And they were to offer all burnt sacrifices to Jehovah in the sabbath, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the face of Jehovah,

32. and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the Holy Place, and the charge of Aaron's sons, their brothers, in the service of the house of Jehovah.  

## 1 Chronicles 24

3. And David divided them according to their offices in their service, even Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar.

4. And more sons of Eleazar were found than the sons of Ithamar, for heads of the men. And they divided them. For the sons of Eleazar were : sixteen chiefs to their father's house; and eight to the sons of Ithamar, to the house of their fathers.

5. So they divided them by lots, these with these. For these were the rulers of the sanctuary and rulers of God, of Eleazar's sons and Ithamar's sons.

6. And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the rulers, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers of the priests and Levites. One father's house was taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

4. But Jehovah the God of Israel chose me out of all my father's house to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah as the ruler, and my father's house in the house of Judah; and among the sons of my father He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.

8. And now in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of Jehovah, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God that you may possess this good land, and cause your sons to inherit after you forever.

9. And you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind. For Jehovah searches out all hearts, and He understands every imagination of thoughts. If you shall seek Him, He shall be found by you. But if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.

10. Watch, now, for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for a sanctuary. Be strong and act.

## 1 Chronicles 29

8. And he having stones gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

9. And the people rejoiced because of their willing offering, for they offered willingly to Jehovah with a perfect heart; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.   

10. And David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed are You, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, our father, for ever and ever.

11. To you, O Jehovah, be the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all in the heavens and in the earth belongs to You, O Jehovah; Yours is the kingdom, and You lift up  Yourself to all as Head;

12. and the riches, and the honor come from before You, and You rule over all; and in Your hand is power and might; and it is in Your hand to make great, and to give strength to all.

13. And now, our God, we are giving thanks to You, and giving praise to Your glorious name;

14. yea, for who am I, and who my people, that we should be able to offer willingly in this way? For all is of You, and we have given to You out of Your hand;

15. for we are strangers before You, and settlers, like all our fathers; our days on the land are like a shadow, and there is none abiding.

16. O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build a house to You, for Your holy name, is out of Your hand, and all is of You.

17. And I know, my God, that You try the heart and are pleased with uprightness; I, in the uprightness of my heart, have offered willingly all these things; and now I have watched with joy Your people who are present here offering willingly to You.

18. O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever for the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart toward You;

19. and give a perfect heart to my son Solomon, to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all, even to build this magnificent house, for which I have prepared.

20. And David said to all the congregation, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the congregation blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Jehovah, and bowed to the king.

21. And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings to Jehovah, on the next day after that day: a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in great plenty for all Israel.

22. And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy, and made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and anointed him before Jehovah as ruler, and Zadok as priest.   

23. And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of his father David, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

24. And all the rulers, and the mighty men, and also all the sons of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.

25. And Jehovah magnified Solomon to a height in the eyes of all Israel, and put the honor of the kingdom on him, such as had not been on any king over Israel before him.

26. And David the son of Jesse had reigned over all Israel;

27. and the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty three years in Jerusalem.

28. And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches, and honor. And his son Solomon reigned in his place.

29. And the acts of David the king, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

30. with all his reign and his might, and the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the lands.
