# Exodus

## Exodus 1

1. And these were the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt with Jacob; they each one came in with his house:

2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

4. Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

5. And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, Joseph being in Egypt.

6. And Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.

7. And the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased very much, and multiplied, and became very strong; and the land was filled with them.   

8. And a new king arose over Egypt, who had not known Joseph.

9. And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are many and stronger than we.

10. Come, let us deal craftily towards them, lest they multiply and it shall be that when war occurs they will also add to our enemies, and will fight against us and go up from the land.

11. And they put over them slave-masters in order to afflict them with their burdens. And he built store cities for Pharaoh: Pithon and Raamses.

12. And as much as they afflicted them, so much they multiplied and so much they spread. And they were afraid before the sons of Israel.

13. And Egypt made the sons of Israel to serve with harshness.

14. And they made their lives bitter by hard service, in clay, and in bricks, and in all work in the field; all their work which they made them do with harshness.   

15. And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrews, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the second, Puah;

16. and he said, When you midwife the Hebrew women, and look on the birth-stools, if it is a son, you will kill him; and if it is a daughter, it shall live.

17. And the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt said to them. And they kept the male children alive.

18. And the king of Egypt called to the midwives and said to them, Why do you do this thing and keep alive the male children?

19. And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous. Before the midwives come to them they bear.

20. And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became exceedingly strong.

21. And it was, because the midwives feared God, He made houses for them.

22. And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every son that is born, you shall cast him into the river. And you shall keep alive every daughter.  

## Exodus 2

1. And a man went from the house of Levi and took a daughter of Levi.

2. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and she saw him, that he was beautiful. And she concealed him three months.

3. And she was not able to hide him any longer, and she took a basket for him made of papyrus, and she daubed it with bitumen and with pitch. And she put the child in it, and placed it in the reeds by the lip of the Nile.

4. And his sister took her stand from a distance, to know what would be done to him.   

5. And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe at the Nile. And her slave women were walking on the side of the Nile. And she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds, and sent her slave-girl and took it.

6. And she opened it and saw the child, and, behold, a boy crying! And she had pity on him and said, This one is of the children of the Hebrews.

7. And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a woman for you, a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?

8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.

9. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give your wages. And the woman took the child and nursed him.

10. And the child grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh. And he became a son to her, and she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.   

11. And it happened in those days, even Moses was grown, and he went out to his brothers and looked upon their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian man strike a Hebrew man of his brothers.

12. And he turned here and there and saw that no man was there. And he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

13. And he went out on the second day, and, behold, two men, Hebrews, were fighting. And he said to the guilty one, Why should you strike your neighbor?

14. And he said, Who appointed you as a man, a ruler and a judge over us? Are you saying to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.

15. And Pharaoh heard this word, and he sought to kill Moses. And Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian. And he sat down by the well.   

16. And the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew and filled the troughs to water their father's flocks.

17. And the shepherds came and drove them away; and Moses rose up and saved them, and watered their flocks.

18. And they came to their father Reuel; and he said, Why have you hurried to come today?

19. And they said, An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew for us and watered the flock.

20. And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why then have you left the man? Call him, and let him eat bread.

21. And Moses consented to live with the man; and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.

22. And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have become an alien in a foreign land.   

23. And it happened during these many days that the king of Egypt died, and the sons of Israel groaned from the slavery. And they cried, and their cry went up to God from the slavery.

24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

25. And God saw the sons of Israel, and God knew them .  

## Exodus 3

1. And Moses was feeding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock behind the wilderness and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.

2. And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire from the middle of a thorn bush. And he looked, and behold, the thorn bush was burning with fire, and the thorn bush was not burned up!

3. And Moses said, I will turn aside now and see this great sight, why the thorn bush is not burned up.

4. And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the thorn bush, and said, Moses! Moses! And he said, Behold me.

5. And He said, Do not come near here pull off your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.

6. And He said, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he feared to look upon God.   

7. And Jehovah said, I have certainly seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry from before their slave-drivers; for I know his sorrows.

8. And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and broad land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Jebusite.

9. And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me, and I also have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.

10. And now, come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and you bring My people out, the sons of Israel out of Egypt.   

11. And Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt?

12. And He said, I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent you, when you bring out the people from Egypt: You shall serve God on this mountain.

13. And Moses said to God, Behold, I shall come to the sons of Israel and say to them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you; and they will say to me, What is His name? What shall I say to them?

14. And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM; and He said, you shall say this to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.

15. And God said to Moses again, You shall say this to the sons of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial from generation to generation.   

16. Go, and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, Jehovah the God of your fathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have surely visited you and have seen what is done to you in Egypt.

17. And I have said, I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; to a land flowing with milk and honey.

18. And they shall listen to your voice; and you shall come in, you and the elders of Israel to the king of Egypt. And you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has met us; and now, please let us go for a journey of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God.

19. And I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, not even by a strong hand.

20. And I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders, which I will do in its midst, and afterward he will send you away.

21. And I will give this people favor in the eyes of Egypt; and it will come to pass, when you go, you will not go empty.

22. And each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and from the stranger in her house, articles of silver, and articles of gold, and garments; and you shall put these on your sons and on your daughters And you shall plunder Egypt.  

## Exodus 4

1. And Moses answered and said, And, behold, they will not believe me and will not listen to my voice. For they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to you.

2. And Jehovah said to him, What is this in your hand? And he said, A staff.

3. And He said, Throw it to the ground. And he threw it to the ground, and it became a snake. And Moses fled before it.

4. And Jehovah said to Moses, Send out your hand and take it by the tail. And he sent out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand;

5. so that they may believe that Jehovah the God of their fathers has appeared to you, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

6. And Jehovah said to him again, Now put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and he brought it out, and, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.

7. And He said, Put your hand back into your bosom. And he put his hand back into his bosom, and he brought it out from his bosom; and, behold, it had turned like his flesh!

8. And it shall be, if they will not believe you and will not listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the latter sign.

9. And it shall be, if they will not believe these two signs also, and will not listen to your voice, you shall take of the water of the Nile and pour it on the dry land. And the water which you take from the Nile shall become blood on the dry land.   

10. And Moses said to Jehovah, O Lord, I am not a man of words, either from yesterday or the third day, nor since You have been speaking to Your bondslave. For I am slow of mouth and slow of tongue.

11. And Jehovah said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes the dumb, or the deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? is it not I, Jehovah?

12. And now go, and I will be with your mouth, and will teach you what you shall speak.

13. And he said, O Lord, please send by the hand of him whom You will send.

14. And the anger of Jehovah glowed against Moses. And He said, Do I not know your brother, Aaron the Levite, that he can speak well? And, behold, he also is coming out to meet you, and he will see you and be glad in his heart.

15. And you shall speak to him, and you shall put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do.

16. And he shall speak for you to the people. And it shall be, he shall be a mouth for you, and you shall be a god for him.

17. And you shall take this staff in your hand by which you do the signs.   

18. And Moses went and returned to his father-in-law Jethro, and said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

19. And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go! Return to Egypt. For all the men are dead, those seeking your life.

20. And Moses took his wife and his sons and made them ride on an ass. And he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.

21. And Jehovah said to Moses, As you go to return to Egypt, see all the wonders which I have put in your hand, and do them before Pharaoh. And I will harden his heart, and he will not send the people away.

22. And you shall speak to Pharaoh, So says Jehovah, My son, My first-born is Israel.

23. And I said to you, Send My son away, and let him serve Me; and you refused to send him. Behold, I am about to kill your son, your first-born!   

24. And it happened on the way, in the lodging place, Jehovah met him and sought to kill him.

25. And Zipporah took a stone and cut off her son's foreskin, and caused it to touch his feet. And she said, You are a bridegroom of bloods to me.

26. And He pulled back from him. Then she said, A bridegroom of bloods, for the circumcision.

27. And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go to the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went and met him in the mountain of God; and he kissed him.

28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which He had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him.

29. And Moses and Aaron went on and gathered all the elders of the sons of Israel.

30. And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses. And he did the signs before the people.

31. And the people believed. And they heard that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction. And they bowed and worshiped.  

## Exodus 5

1. And afterward Moses and Aaron came in and said to Pharaoh, So says Jehovah the God of Israel, Send away My people, and they shall feast to Me in the wilderness.

2. And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah that I should listen to His voice to send away Israel? I do not know Jehovah, and I also will not send Israel away.   

3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us go a journey of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, that He not strike us with plague or with sword.

4. And the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, why do you loose the people from their work? You go to your burdens.

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are many now, and you make them cease from their burdens.

6. And Pharaoh commanded the slave-drivers of the people, and their overseers, that day, saying,

7. You shall not go on giving straw to the people to make bricks, as yesterday and the third day. They shall go and pick up straw for themselves.

8. And the fixed number of bricks which they were making yesterday and the third day you shall put on them. You shall not diminish from it. For they are idle; so they are crying, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God.

9. Let the bondage be heavy on the men, that they may work in it, and may not trust in the lying words.   

10. And the slave-drivers of the people, and their overseers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Pharaoh has said this, I will not give you straw.

11. You go take straw for yourselves from wherever you may find it. For not a thing will be reduced from your work.

12. And the people scattered in all the land of Egypt to pick up stubble for straw.

13. And the slave-drivers were demanding, saying, Finish your work, the matter of a day in its day, as when there was straw.

14. And the overseers of the sons of Israel were beaten, those whom the slave-drivers of Pharaoh had put over them, saying, Why have you not finished your appointed task, to make bricks as a day ago and the day before, both yesterday and today?   

15. And the overseers of the sons of Israel came in and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you do this way to your slaves?

16. No straw is given to your slaves, and they are saying to us, Make bricks. And, behold, your slaves are beaten, but your people are at fault.

17. And he said, You are lazy and idle. So you are saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah.

18. Therefore, go now and work. And straw will not be given to you; and a certain number of bricks you shall deliver.

19. And the overseers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in affliction, saying, You shall not diminish from your bricks, the matter of a day in its day.

20. And they met Moses and Aaron standing to meet them when they came from Pharaoh.

21. And they said to them, May Jehovah look on you and judge, you who have made our odor to stink in Pharaoh's eyes and in the eyes of his servants, to give a sword in their hands to kill us.

22. And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, Lord, why have You done evil to this people? Why then have You sent me?

23. And since I came in to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people. And You did not certainly deliver your people.  

## Exodus 6

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. For he will send them away with a strong hand, yea, he will drive them out from his land with a strong hand.

2. And God spoke to Moses and said to him, I am Jehovah.

3. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, and by My name JEHOVAH I never made Myself known to them.

4. And I also established My covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they traveled.

5. And I also have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are enslaving. And I have remembered My covenant.

6. Therefore, say to the sons of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt, and will deliver you from their slavery. And I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.

7. And I will take you for Myself for a people, and I will be a God for you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, the One bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt.

8. And I will bring you into the land which I raised My hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And I will give it to you for a possession. I am Jehovah!

9. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel. And they did not listen to Moses, from shortness of spirit and from hard bondage.   

10. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Go, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he may send away the sons of Israel from his land.

12. And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, Behold the sons of Israel have not listened to me. And how should Pharaoh hear me, I being of uncircumcised lips?

13. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and He commanded them as to the sons of Israel, and as to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt.   

14. These were the heads of the houses of their fathers: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi; these were the families of Reuben.

15. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanitess; these were the families of Simeon.

16. And these were the names of the sons of Levi by their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty seven years.

17. The sons of Gershon: Libni, and Shimei, by their families.

18. And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred and thirty three years.

19. And the sons of Merari: Mahli, and Mushi. These were the families of Levi according to their generations.

20. And Amram took his aunt Jochebed to him for a wife. And she bore to him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty seven years.

21. And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

22. And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

23. And Aaron took Elisheba the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to him for a wife. And she bore to him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24. And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the families of the Korahites.

25. And Aaron's son Eleazar took of the daughters of Putiel for his wife. And she bore to him Phinehas. These were the heads of the fathers of the Levites by their families.

26. That is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, according to their armies.

27. Those were the ones speaking to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was Moses and Aaron.

28. And it happened on the day Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt:

29. Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah! Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all which I am about to speak to you.

30. And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How could Pharaoh listen to me?  

## Exodus 7

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh; and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.

2. You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh. And he will send away the sons of Israel from his land.

3. And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh. And I will multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.

4. And Pharaoh will not listen to you. And I will lay My hand on Egypt, and will bring My armies, My people, the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt with great judgments.

5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah when I send forth My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst.

6. And Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded them, so they did.

7. And Moses was a son of eighty years, and Aaron was a son of eighty three years when they spoke to Pharaoh.   

8. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

9. When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, Give a miracle for yourselves, you shall say to Aaron, Take your staff and throw it before Pharaoh; and let it become a snake.

10. And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded. And Aaron threw his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants. And it became a snake.

11. And Pharaoh also called wise men and the sorcerers. And they, the priests of Egypt, also performed by their secret arts.

12. And they each one threw down his staff, and they became snakes. But Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs.

13. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as Jehovah had said.   

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, The heart of Pharaoh is heavy; he refuses to send away the people.

15. Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he is about to go out to the water. And you stand to meet him on the lip of the river. And you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a snake.

16. And you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Send away My people, so that they may serve Me in the wilderness. And, behold, you have not listened until now.

17. So says Jehovah, By this you shall know that I am Jehovah: Behold, I am about to strike the water in the river with the staff in My hand, and it shall be turned to blood.

18. And the fish in the river will die, and the river will stink, and the Egyptians will become weary of drinking water from the river.

19. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your staff, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over the rivers over their canals, and over their pools, and over every body of their waters, so that they may become blood. And blood shall be in all the land of Egypt, both in wooden and in stone vessels.

20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah had commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the water which was in the river before Pharaoh's eyes, and before his servants' eyes. And all the water in the river turned to blood.

21. And the fish in the river died, and the river stunk. And the Egyptians were not able to drink water from the Nile. And the blood was in all the land of Egypt.

22. And the magicians of Egypt did so by their secret arts. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as Jehovah had said.

23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. And he did not set his heart to this also.

24. And all the Egyptians dug around the river to drink water, for they were not able to drink from the water of the river.

25. And seven days went by after Jehovah smote the river.  

## Exodus 8

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, So says Jehovah, Send away My people that they may serve Me.

2. And if you refuse to send them away, behold, I am about to smite all your territory with frogs.

3. And the river will swarm with frogs. And they shall go up and enter into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your couch, and into your servants' house, and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs.

4. And the frogs will come up on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.

5. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools. And bring up frogs on the land of Egypt.

6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

7. And the priests did so with their secret arts. And they brought up the frogs on the land of Egypt.

8. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Pray to Jehovah that He may remove the frogs from me and from my people. And I will send away the people that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.

9. And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me. For when shall I pray for you and for your servants and for your people, to cut off the frogs from you, and from your house, that they may be left only in the river?

10. And he said, For tomorrow. And he said, According to your word, so that you may know that none is like Jehovah our God.

11. And the frogs will depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They will only be in the river.

12. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried to Jehovah concerning the frogs which He had set on Pharaoh.

13. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died from the houses, from the courts, and from the fields.

14. And they gathered them in heaps and heaps; and the land stunk.

15. And Pharaoh saw that there was relief. And he made his heart heavy, and he did not listen to them, as Jehovah had said.   

16. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and let it become lice in all the land of Egypt.

17. And they did so, and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth. And the lice were on man and on beast. All the dust of the earth became lice in the land of Egypt.

18. And the priests performed with their secret arts to bring forth lice, and they could not. And the lice were on man and on beast.

19. And the priests said to Pharaoh, It is the finger of God. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as Jehovah had said.   

20. And Jehovah said to Moses, Get up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh. Behold, he is about to go out to the water. And say to him, So says Jehovah, Send away My people that they may serve Me.

21. And if you do not send away My people, behold, I am about to send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and on your house. And the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground on which they are .

22. And in that day I will separate the land of Goshen with My people resting on it, that there be no swarms of flies , so that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.

23. And I will put redemption between My people and your people. This miracle shall be for tomorrow.

24. And Jehovah did so. And teeming swarms of flies came into Pharaoh's house, and the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt. And the land was destroyed before the swarms of flies .

25. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go! Sacrifice to your God in the land.

26. And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God. Behold! If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?

27. We will go into the wilderness, a journey of three days, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as He may say to us.

28. And Pharaoh said, I will send you away, and you may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only do not go very far off. Pray for me.

29. And Moses said, Behold, I am about to go out from you, and to pray to Jehovah. And the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. But do not let Pharaoh continue to deceive, not to send the people to sacrifice to Jehovah.

30. And Moses went out from Pharaoh. And he prayed to Jehovah.

31. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses, and the swarms of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; and not one was left.

32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not send away the people.  

## Exodus 9

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, So says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Send away My people that they may serve Me.

2. And if you refuse to send away, and you still hold onto them,

3. behold the hand of Jehovah is going to be on your livestock in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks, a very heavy pestilence.

4. And Jehovah will make a distinction between Israel's livestock and Egypt's livestock. Also of all that belongs to the sons of Israel, not a thing will die.

5. And Jehovah set a time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah will do this thing in the land.

6. And Jehovah did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died. And from the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died.

7. And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not even one was dead from Israel's livestock! And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not send away the people.   

8. And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take for yourselves the fullness of your hands of soot from the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven before Pharaoh's eyes.

9. And let it become dust on all the land of Egypt, and let it become an inflammation breaking out into a boil on man and on livestock in all the land of Egypt.

10. And they took soot of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens, and it became an inflammation breaking out into boils on man and on livestock.

11. And the priests were not able to stand before Moses, before the inflammation. For the inflammation was on the priests and on all the Egyptians.

12. And Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, as Jehovah had said to Moses.   

13. And Jehovah said to Moses, Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, So says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Send away My people that they may serve Me.

14. For at this time I am going to send all My plagues to your heart, and on your servants, and on your people, so that you may know that none is like Me in all the land.

15. For now I have sent forth My hand and have stricken you and your people with pestilence, and you have been destroyed from the earth.

16. And for this reason I have made you stand, in order to cause you to see My power, and in order to declare My name in all the land.

17. You still are exalting yourself against My people, so as not to send them away.

18. Behold! I will rain very grievous hail about this time tomorrow, such as has never been in Egypt from the day of its foundation until now.

19. And now send out, bring your livestock to safety, and all belonging to you in the field. All men and livestock found in the field, and not brought to the house, the hail will come on them, and they will die.

20. Of the servants of Pharaoh, the one who feared the word of Jehovah made his slaves and his livestock flee to the houses.

21. And the one who did not set his heart on the word of Jehovah left his slaves and his livestock in the field.   

22. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand to the heavens, so that hail may be in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on livestock, and on every plant of the field in the land of Egypt.

23. And Moses stretched out his staff to the heavens. And Jehovah gave thunder and hail. And fire came down to the earth, and Jehovah rained hail on the land of Egypt.

24. And there was hail, and fire flashing in the midst of the hail, very heavy, which never had been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

25. And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, from men and to livestock. And the hail struck every plant of the field, and it broke in pieces every tree of the field.

26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel lived , there was no hail.

27. And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. Jehovah is the righteous One, and I and my people the wicked ones.

28. Pray to Jehovah and let it be enough of the thunders and hail of God. And I will send you away and you shall not continue any longer.

29. And Moses said to him, As I go out of the city I will spread out my palms to Jehovah. The thunder will cease, and the hail will not still be, so that you may know that the earth is Jehovah's.

30. And as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear before Jehovah God.

31. And the flax and the barley were stricken. For the barley in head, and the flax in bud.

32. And the wheat and the spelt were not stricken, for they were late.

33. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, from the city, and he spread out his palms to Jehovah. And the thunder and the hail ceased. And rain was not poured out toward the earth.

34. And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, and he continued to sin. And he hardened his heart, he and his servants.

35. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not send away the sons of Israel, as Jehovah had said by the hand of Moses.  

## Exodus 10

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, so that I may set these signs of Mine in their midst;

2. and so that you may recount in the ears of your son and the son of your son what I exerted Myself to do against Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, and you may know that I am Jehovah.

3. And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, So says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Until when will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Send away My people so that they may serve Me.

4. For if you refuse to send away My people, behold, I am going to bring locusts into your territory tomorrow.

5. And they will cover the eye of the land, and no one will be able to see the land. And they will eat the rest of that which escaped, that which is left to you from the hail. And they will eat every tree that sprouts to you from the field.

6. And your houses will be full, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of the Egyptians, which neither your fathers nor the fathers of your fathers have seen; from the day of their being on the earth until this day. And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.

7. And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this one be a snare to us? Send away the men that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is perishing?

8. And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who and who are the ones going?

9. And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters. We will go with our flocks and with our herds. For it is a feast of Jehovah to us.

10. And he said to them, May Jehovah be so with you, as I send you away, and your little ones. Watch! For evil is before your face!

11. Not so! You and the men go now and serve Jehovah. For you were seeking it. And he drove them out from the face of Pharaoh.   

12. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand for the locusts over the land of Egypt, so that they may go up on the land of Egypt and may eat every plant of the land, all that the hail left.

13. And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt. And Jehovah brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night. And at morning the east wind lifted up the locusts.

14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested on all the territory of Egypt, exceedingly many. Never were there locusts like them before, and afterward none will be like them.

15. And they covered the eye of the earth, and the land became dark. And they ate every plant of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. And no greenness was left in the trees and in the plants of the field in all the land of Egypt.

16. And Pharaoh hurried to call Moses and Aaron. And he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.

17. And now pray forgive my sins only this time, and pray to Jehovah your God that He may take away from me this death only.

18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and he prayed to Jehovah.

19. And Jehovah changed to a west wind, very strong. And it carried the locusts and threw them into the Sea of Reeds. Not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.

20. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not send away the sons of Israel.   

21. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand to the heavens so that darkness may be on the land of Egypt, and one may feel darkness.

22. And Moses stretched out his hand to the heavens, and darkness of gloom was in all the land of Egypt three days.

23. They did not see each one his brother, and they did not rise up, each one from his place for three days. Yet to all the sons of Israel there was light in their dwellings.

24. And Pharaoh called to Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah. Only leave your flocks and your herds behind. Your little ones may go with you.

25. And Moses said, You must also give into our hands sacrifices and burnt offerings so that we may prepare for Jehovah our God.

26. And also our livestock shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left. For we shall take from them to serve Jehovah our God. And we do not know with what we shall serve Jehovah until we come there.

27. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he was not willing to send them away.

28. And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me. Be careful for yourself. Do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die.

29. And Moses said, You have spoken rightly. I will not see your face again.  

## Exodus 11

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, I will bring still one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will send you from here. When he sends you away completely, he will surely drive you out from here.

2. Now speak in the ears of the people, and let them ask, each man from his neighbor, articles of silver and articles of gold.

3. And Jehovah gave favor in the eyes of the Egyptians toward the people. And the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of the people.   

4. And Moses said, So says Jehovah, About the middle of the night I will go out in the midst of Egypt.

5. And every first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh, the one sitting on his throne, to the first-born of the slave-girl who is behind the mill; and every first born of animals.

6. And a great cry shall be in all the land of Egypt, such as never has been, and nothing like it shall be again.

7. And a dog shall not sharpen his tongue against all the sons of Israel, toward man and toward livestock, so that you may know that Jehovah distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.

8. And all these servants of yours will come down to me, and bow to me, saying, Go out, you and all the people at your feet. And afterward I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger.

9. And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My miracles may multiply in the land of Egypt.

10. And Moses and Aaron did all these miracles before Pharaoh. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not send away the sons of Israel from his land.  

## Exodus 12

1. And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2. This month shall be the chief of months for you. It shall be the first of the months of the year for you.

3. Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month, they shall each take for themselves an animal of the flock for a father's house, a flock animal for a house.

4. And if the house is too small for a flock animal, he and his neighbor next to his house shall take according to the number of souls, each one according to the mouth of his eating, you shall count concerning the flock animal.

5. A flock animal, a perfect one, a male, a yearling, shall be to you. You shall take from the sheep or from the goats.

6. And it shall be for you to keep until the fourteenth day of this month. And all the assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it between the evenings.

7. And they shall take from the blood, and put it on the two side doorposts and on the upper doorpost, on the houses in which they eat it.

8. And they shall eat the flesh in this night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

9. Do not eat it raw, or at all boiled in water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs and with its inward parts.

10. And you shall not leave any of it until morning. And you shall burn with fire that left from it until morning.

11. And you shall eat it this way: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the Passover to Jehovah.

12. And I will pass through in the land of Egypt in this night. And I will strike every first born in the land of Egypt, from man even to livestock. And I will execute judgments on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah!

13. And the blood shall be a sign to you, on the houses where you are . And I will see the blood, and I will pass over you. And the plague shall not be on you to destroy, when I strike in the land of Egypt.

14. And the day shall be a memorial for you. And you shall celebrate it as a feast to Jehovah, for your generations. You shall celebrate it as a law forever.

15. You shall eat unleavened bread seven days. Indeed, on the first day you shall cause leaven to cease from your houses. For anyone eating anything leavened, that soul shall be cut off from Israel, from the first day until the seventh day.

16. And on the first day shall be a holy gathering, and in the seventh day a holy gathering shall be to you. Not any work may be done on them. Only what must be eaten by your soul, that alone may be done by you.

17. And you shall observe the unleavened bread for on this very day I brought out your armies from the land of Egypt. And you shall observe this day for your generations, a statute forever.

18. In the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening you shall eat unleavened bread , until the twenty first day of the month, at evening.

19.  For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses. For anyone eating anything leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, among the aliens, and among the natives of the land.

20. You shall not eat anything leavened. You shall eat unleavened bread in all your dwellings.   

21. And Moses called to all the elders of Israel and said to them Draw out and take of the flock for you and for your families, and kill the passover.

22. And take a bunch of hyssop and dip in the blood in the basin. And touch some of the blood in the basin to the upper doorpost and to the two side doorposts. And you shall not go out, anyone from the door of his house until morning.

23. And Jehovah will pass through to strike Egypt. And He will see the blood on the upper doorpost and on the two side doorposts, and Jehovah will pass over the door. And He will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you.

24. And you shall observe this word for an ordinance for you, and for your sons forever.

25. And it shall be, when you come into the land which Jehovah shall give to you, as He has spoken, you shall observe this service.

26. And it shall be, when your sons say to you, What is this service to you?

27. Then you shall say, A sacrifice of a passover of Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He struck Egypt. And He delivered our houses. And the people bowed and worshiped.

28. And the sons of Israel went out and did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron. So they did.   

29. And it happened at midnight. Jehovah struck every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh, the one sitting on the throne, to the first-born of the captive who was in the prison house, and every first-born of animals.

30. And Pharaoh arose by night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not a dead one.

31. And he called Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, go out from the midst of my people, both you and the sons of Israel. And go serve Jehovah according to your word.

32. Take both your flocks and your herds, as you said, and go. And bless me also.

33. And the Egyptians were strong on the people, to hasten to send them away from the land. For they said, All of us are about to die.

34. And the people took up their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothing on their shoulders.

35. And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses. And they asked from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing.

36. And Jehovah gave favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians. And they granted their requests And they plundered Egypt.   

37. And the sons of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, the men being about six hundred thousand on foot, apart from little ones.

38. And also a mixed multitude went up with them, and flocks, and herds, very many livestock.

39. And they baked the dough which they brought out from Egypt into unleavened cakes. For it was not leavened, because they were driven out from Egypt, and they were not able to delay. And also they had not prepared food for a journey for themselves.

40. And the time of the dwelling of the sons of Israel, which they dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

41. And it happened, from the end of four hundred and thirty years, it happened on this day, all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.

42. It is a night of celebration to Jehovah, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This night is a celebration for all the sons of Israel to their generations.   

43. And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover. No stranger may eat of it.

44. And every man's slave, a purchase of silver, you shall circumcise him, then he may eat of it.

45. A foreigner and a hired servant may not eat of it.

46. It shall be eaten in one house. You shall not carry any of the flesh outside from the house. And you shall not break a bone in it.

47. All the congregation of Israel shall prepare it.

48. And when a visitor shall stay with you, and will do the Passover to Jehovah, let every male to him be circumcised, and then he may come near to prepare it. And he shall be like a native of the land. But any uncircumcised one may not eat of it.

49. One law shall be to the native, and to the visitor, the one staying in your midst.

50. And all the sons of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron. So they did.

51. And it happened on this day, Jehovah brought out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt by their armies.  

## Exodus 13

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Set apart to Me every first-born, the one Opening the womb among the sons of Israel, among men and among livestock; they shall be Mine.

3. And Moses said to the people, Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slaves. For by the might of His hand Jehovah brought you out from here. And no leavened bread shall be eaten.

4. Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.

5. And it shall be when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give to you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall do this service in this month.

6. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , and on the seventh day keep a feast to Jehovah.

7. Unleavened bread shall be eaten the seven days. And leavened bread for you shall not be seen; yea, no leaven shall be seen among you in all your boundaries.

8. And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, It is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out from Egypt.

9. And it shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and a memorial between your eyes, so that a law of Jehovah may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand Jehovah brought you out from Egypt.

10. And you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time, from days to days.   

11. And it shall be when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,

12. you shall set apart to Jehovah every one opening the womb, and every firstling, the offspring of animals which are yours; the males are Jehovah's.

13. And every firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a flock animal. And if you do not redeem, you shall break its neck. And every first-born of men among your sons you shall redeem.

14. And it shall be when your son asks you on the morrow, saying, What is this? You shall say to him, Jehovah brought us out from Egypt by the might of His hand, from the house of slaves.

15. And it happened when Pharaoh hardened himself against sending us away, Jehovah killed every first-born one in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of men even to the first-born of animals. On account of this I sacrifice to Jehovah every one of the males opening the womb, and I redeem every first-born of my sons.

16. And it shall be for a sign on your hand, and frontlets between your eyes. For Jehovah brought us out from Egypt by the might of His hand.   

17. And it happened, in Pharaoh's sending away the people, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, though it was near. For God said, Lest the people repent when they see war, and return to Egypt.

18. But God made the people turn toward the way of the wilderness, to the Sea of Reeds. And the sons of Israel went up armed from the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. For he had made the sons of Israel certainly swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall cause my bones to go from here with you.

20. And they pulled up from Succoth, and they camped at Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

21. And Jehovah was going before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give light to them, to go by day and by night.

22. The pillar of cloud did not cease by day, and the pillar of fire by night, before the people.  

## Exodus 14

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and let them return and camp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon. You shall camp opposite it , by the sea.

3. And Pharaoh will say as to the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has shut them in,

4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue you. And I will be honored through Pharaoh, and through all his armies. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.

5. And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned as to the people. And they said, What is this we have done? For we have sent away Israel from serving us.

6. And he prepared his chariots. And he took his people with him.

7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and officers over all of them.

8. And Jehovah hardened Pharaoh king of Egypt's heart. And he pursued the sons of Israel. And the sons of Israel were going out with a high hand.

9. And the Egyptians pursued them. And they overtook them camping by the sea, all the horses and the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, by Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.   

10. And Pharaoh came near, and the sons of Israel raised their eyes, and, behold! The Egyptians were marching after them! And they were greatly afraid. And the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah.

11. And they said to Moses, Were there no graves in Egypt, that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us, to bring us out from Egypt?

12.  Is this not the word which we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, Go away from us, and let us serve the Egyptians. For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians, than to die in the wilderness.

13. And Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid. Take your stand and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will prepare for you today. For as you see the Egyptians today, you shall not continue to see them again forever.

14. Jehovah will fight for you, and you be silent.   

15. And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do you cry to Me? Speak to the sons of Israel, and let them pull up.

16. And you raise your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it so that the sons of Israel may go in the midst of the sea on dry ground.

17. And behold! I am about to harden the heart of the Egyptians. And they will go after them. And I will be honored through Pharaoh and through his armies, through his chariots, and through his horsemen.

18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, in my being honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots, and through his horsemen.

19. And the Angel of God withdrew, the One going before the camp of Israel. And He went behind them. And the pillar of cloud withdrew from before them, and it stood behind them.

20. And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And it was cloudy and dark. And it gave light to the night; and this one did not come near to that one all night.   

21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night. And He made the sea dry land, and the waters divided.

22. And the sons of Israel came into the middle of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them from their right and from their left.

23. And the Egyptians pursued, and all the horses of Pharaoh came after them, his chariots and his horsemen, into the middle of the sea.

24. And it happened in the morning watch: Jehovah looked on the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and cloud. And He confused the camp of the Egyptians.

25. And He took off the wheels of their chariots, and made them drive with difficulty. And the Egyptians said, I will flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.

26. And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters return on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.

27. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its usual flow, at the turning of the morning, and the Egyptians were fleeing to meet it. And Jehovah shook off the Egyptians into the middle of the sea.

28. And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, together with all the army of Pharaoh, those going after them into the sea. And not even one was left among them.

29. And the sons of Israel walked on dry ground in the middle of the sea, the waters being a wall for them, from their right and from their left.

30. And Jehovah saved Israel in that day from the hand of Egypt. And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the lip of the sea.

31. And Israel saw the great hand with which Jehovah worked against Egypt. And the people feared Jehovah, and they believed in Jehovah and in His servant Moses.  

## Exodus 15

1. Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to Jehovah, and spoke, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for He is highly exalted. He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.

2. My strength and song is Jah, and it happened, He was to me salvation; this is my God and I will glorify Him; the God of my father, and I will exalt Him.

3. Jehovah is a Man of war; Jehovah is His name.

4. He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army in the sea; and the choice ones of his officers are drowned in the Sea of Reeds,

5. the depths cover them; they have dropped into the depths like a stone.

6. Your right hand , O Jehovah, is glorious in power; O Jehovah, Your right dashes the enemy to pieces.

7. And in Your majesty's greatness You pull down those rising up against You; You send forth Your wrath; it consumes them like stubble.

8. And by the spirit of Your anger waters were heaped up; the running waters stood like a wall; the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.

9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be filled with them; I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.

10. You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in mighty waters.

11. Who is like You among the gods, O Jehovah? Who is like You, glorified in holiness, fearful in praises, O Worker of wonders?

12. You stretched Your right hand ; the earth swallowed them.

13. In Your mercy You led the people whom You redeemed; You guided in Your strength to Your holy dwelling.

14. Peoples heard; they tremble; trembling seized the dwellers of Philistia.

15. Then the chiefs of Edom were terrified; the leaders of Moab were seized by trembling; all the dwellers of Canaan were melted.

16. Terrors and dread fell on them; by the greatness of Your arm; they are silent as a stone, until Your people pass through, O Jehovah, until pass through the people whom You have bought.

17. You shall bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place You have made for Your dwelling place, O Jehovah; the sanctuary which Your hands have prepared, O Lord.

18. Jehovah reigns forever and ever!

19. For the horses oh Pharaoh went in with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea on them; and the sons of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

20. And the sister of Aaron, Miriam the prophetess took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

21. And Miriam answered to them, Sing to Jehovah, for surely He has triumphed gloriously; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea.   

22. And Moses made Israel to pull out from the Sea of Reeds. And they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went into the wilderness three days, and did not find water.

23. And they came to Marah. And they were not able to drink water from Marah, for it was bitter. Therefore, one called its name Marah.

24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

25. And he cried to Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree. And he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. He made a statute and an ordinance for them there, and He tested them there.

26. And he said, If you carefully listen to the voice of Jehovah your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and you give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will not put on you all the diseases which I have put on Egypt; for I am Jehovah your healer.

27. And they came to Elim. And there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. And they camped by the waters.  

## Exodus 16

1. And they pulled out from Elim And all the congregation of the sons of Israel came into the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their going out from the land of Egypt.

2. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.

3. And the sons of Israel said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, in our sitting by the fleshpots, in our eating bread to satisfaction. For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill all this assembly with hunger.

4. And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I AM ! Bread will rain from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather the matter of a day in its day, so that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.

5. And it shall be on the sixth day they shall prepare what they bring in. And it shall be double what they gather day by day.

6. And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening. you shall know that Jehovah has brought you from the land of Egypt;

7. and in the morning you shall see the glory of Jehovah, in His hearing your murmurings against Jehovah. And we, what are we that you murmur against us?

8. And Moses said, When Jehovah gives you flesh to eat in the evening, and bread in the morning, to satisfaction; when Jehovah hears your murmurings which you are murmuring against Him, you will see . And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.

9. And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for He has heard your murmurings.

10. And it happened, as Aaron was speaking to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, they turned toward the wilderness. And, behold! The glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud!

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

12. I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, Between the evenings you shall eat flesh; and in the morning you shall be satisfied with bread; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God.   

13. And it happened in the evening: the quail came up and covered the camp. And in the morning a layer of dew was around the camp.

14. And the layer of dew went up, and, behold, something small was on the face of the wilderness, scalelike, small like the hoarfrost on the earth.

15. And the sons of Israel looked. And they said, each one to his brother, What is that? For they did not know what it was . And Moses said to them, That is the bread which Jehovah has given to you for food.

16. This is the thing which Jehovah commanded. Gather from it, each one according to the mouth of his eating; an omer for a head. By the number of your souls you shall take for each man who is in your tent.

17. And so the sons of Israel did. And they gathered; the one gathering much and the one gathering little.

18. And they measured with an omer. And the one gathering much did not have too much. And the one gathering little did not have any need. Each one gathered according to the mouth of his eating.

19. And Moses said to them, Do not let anyone leave from it until morning.

20. And they did not listen to Moses. And some left from it until morning; and it became rotten with maggots, and stunk. And Moses was angry against them.

21. And they gathered it in the morning, each one in the morning according to the mouth of his eating. And it melted in the heat of the sun.   

22. And it came about on the sixth day, they gathered double bread, two omers for one. And all the leaders of the congregation came and reported to Moses.

23. And he said to them, That is what Jehovah said, Tomorrow is a rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah. What you will bake, bake. And boil what you will boil. And lay up for yourselves all that is left over, to keep it until the morning.

24. And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses commanded. And it did not stink and no maggot was in it.

25. And Moses said, Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today you will not find it in the field.

26. You shall gather it six days, and on the seventh is a sabbath; in it none shall be found.

27. And it happened on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and did not find any .

28. And Jehovah said to Moses, Until when do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?

29. Behold! Because Jehovah has given the sabbath to you, therefore He is giving to you two days of bread on the sixth day. Each one of you remain in his place. Do not let anyone go out from his place on the seventh day.

30. And the people rested on the seventh day.

31. And the house of Israel called its name, Manna. And it was like the seed of coriander, white; and its taste like cakes with honey.   

32. And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded, Fill an omer from it, to keep for your generations, so that they may see the bread which I caused you to eat in the wilderness, as I brought you out from the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pitcher and put manna there. the fullness of an omer, and lay it up before Jehovah, to keep for your generations.

34. Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to keep it .

35. And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until their coming into an inhabited land. They ate the manna until their coming to the border of the land of Canaan.

36. And the omer was the tenth of an ephah.  

## Exodus 17

1. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel pulled up stakes from the Wilderness of Sin, according to their journeys, by the mouth of Jehovah. And they camped in Rephidim. And there was no water for the drinking of the people.

2. And the people wrangled with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you wrangle with me? Why do you tempt Jehovah?

3. And the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why, then, have you caused us to go up from Egypt, to kill me and my sons and my livestock with thirst?

4. And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? Yet a little and they will stone me.

5. And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass on in front of the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel And take in your hand your staff with which you smote the River, and go.

6. Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. And you shall smite the rock, and water will come out of it; and the people will drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.

7. And one called the name of the place, Massah, and, Meribah because of the wrangling of the sons of Israel, and because of their testing of Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah in our midst, or not?   

8. And Amalek came and fought against Israel in Rephidim.

9. And Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us, and go fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill, and the staff of God in my hand.

10. And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight against Amalek And Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

11. And so it was that when Moses lifted his hand, Israel prevailed. And when he rested his hand, Amalek conquered.

12. And the hands of Moses became heavy. And they took a stone and put it under him. And he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one from this and one from that side . And his hands were steady until the going of the sun.

13. And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people by the mouth of the sword.

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this, a memorial in a book, and set it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly wipe away the remembrance of Amalek under the heavens.

15. And Moses built an altar. And he called its name, Jehovah My Banner.

16. And he said, A hand is on the throne of Jehovah; war is to Jehovah with Amalek from generation to generation.  

## Exodus 18

1. And Jethro the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses, heard all that which God had done for Moses and for His people Israel, that Jehovah had caused Israel to go out from Egypt.

2. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, (after Moses had sent her away,)

3. and her two sons, of one's name was Gershom (for he said, I have become an alien in a foreign land;)

4. and one's name was Eliezer (for the God of my father was my Help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh).

5. And Jethro Moses' father-in-law, and his sons and his wife came to Moses, to the wilderness where he camped, at the mount of God.

6. And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, and your wife, and your two sons with her have come to you.   

7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed, and kissed him. And they asked each to his neighbor, as to their welfare. And they came into the tent.

8. And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the trouble which they had found in the way, and Jehovah had delivered them.

9. And Jethro rejoiced regarding all the good which Jehovah had done to Israel whom He had delivered from the hand of Egypt.

10. And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah who has from the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of Egypt.

11. Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the gods; truly, in the way in which they were proved against them.

12. And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. And Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread before God with Moses' father-in-law.   

13. And it happened on the next day that Moses sat to judge the people. And the people stood beside Moses from the morning until the evening.

14. And Moses' father-in-law saw all he was doing to the people. And he said, what is this thing which you are doing to the people? Why are you sitting by yourself, and all the people standing beside you from morning until evening?

15. And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to seek God.

16. When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor. And I reveal the statutes of God, and His laws.

17. And the father-in-law of Moses said to him, The thing which you do is not good.

18. Surely you will wear out, both you and this people with you. For the thing is heavy for you. You are not able to do it by yourself.

19. Now listen to my voice. I will counsel you, and may God be with you. You be for this people before God, and you bring the matters to God.

20. And you warn them as to the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they should walk, and the work which they should do.

21. And you, you shall look out men of ability out of all the people, who fear God, men of truth, haters of unjust gain. And you place these over them as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

22. And let them judge the people at all times. And it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, and every small matter they shall judge. And you make it easy on yourself, and let them bear with you.

23. If you do this thing, and God command you, you will be able to stand; and also this people will go in peace to their place.

24. And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and he did all that he had said.

25. And Moses chose men of ability from all Israel and made them heads over the people; rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

26. And they judged the people at all times; the hard matters they brought to Moses, and every small matter they judged themselves.

27. And Moses sent his father-in-law away, and he went to his own land.  

## Exodus 19

1. In the third month of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, on this day they came to the wilderness of Sinai.

2. And they pulled up stakes from Rephidim and came to the wilderness of Sinai. And they camped in the wilderness. And Israel camped there before the mountain.

3. And Moses went up to God. And Jehovah called to him from the mountain, saying, You shall say this to the house of Jacob, and tell it to the sons of Israel.

4. You have seen what I did to Egypt; and I bore you on wings of eagles and brought you to Me.

5. And now if you will surely listen to My voice, and will keep My covenant, you shall become a special treasure to Me above all the nations, for all the earth is Mine.

6. And you shall become a kingdom of priests for Me, a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the sons of Israel.

7. And Moses came and called the elders of the people. And he put all these words before them which Jehovah commanded him.

8. And all the people answered together and said, All which Jehovah has spoken we will do. And Moses brought back the words of the people to Jehovah.   

9. And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I come to you in a darkness of clouds, so that the people may hear My speaking with you, and in you they may believe forever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah.

10. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow. And let them wash their clothes.

11. And be ready for the third day. For on the third day Jehovah will go down before the eyes of all the people on the mountain of Sinai.

12. And you shall set limits to the people all around, saying, Be careful for yourselves, not going up into the mountain and touching its border; everyone touching the mountain shall surely be killed.

13. Not a hand shall touch him, but surely he shall be stoned, or surely he shall be shot through. He shall not live, whether animal or man. At the sounding of the ram's horn, they shall go up into the mountain.

14. And Moses went from the mountain to the people. And he sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.

15. And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Do not approach a woman.   

16. And on the third day, it being morning, it happened: There were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the sound of a ram's horn, very strong! And all the people in the camp trembled.

17. And Moses caused the people to go up from the camp to meet God. And they took their stand at the lower part of the mountain.

18. And the mountain of Sinai was smoking, all of it, because Jehovah came down on it in fire. And its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace; and the mountain quaked exceedingly.

19. And it happened while the sound of the ram's horn was sounding, and becoming very strong, Moses spoke. And God answered him by a voice.

20. And Jehovah came down on the mountain of Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.

21. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, warn the people lest they break through to gaze at Jehovah, and many of them fall.

22. And also the priests, those approaching Jehovah, let them sanctify themselves that Jehovah not burst forth among them.

23. And Moses said to Jehovah, The people are not able to come up to the mountain of Sinai. For You warned us, saying, Set limits to the mountain and sanctify it.

24. And Jehovah said to him, Come, go down. And you come up, and Aaron with you. And let not the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, lest He burst forth among them.

25. And Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.  

## Exodus 20

1. And God spoke all these words, saying:

2. I am Jehovah your God, who has brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

3. You shall not have any other gods beside Me.

4. You shall not make a graven image for yourself, or any likeness in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth;

5. you shall not bow to them, and you shall not serve them; for I am Jehovah your God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of fathers on sons, on the third and on the fourth generation, to those that hate Me;

6. and doing kindness to thousands, to those loving Me, and to those keeping My commandments.

7. You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain; for Jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes His name in vain.

8. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy;

9. six days you shall labor and do all your work;

10. and the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God; you shall not do any work, you, and your son, and your daughter, your male slave and your slave-girl, and your livestock, and your stranger who is in your gates.

11. For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all which is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; on account of this Jehovah blessed the sabbath day and sanctified it.   

12. Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long on the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.

13. You shall not murder.

14. You shall not commit adultery.

15. You shall not steal.

16. You shall not testify a witness of falsehood against your neighbor.

17. You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male slave, or his slave-girl, or his ox, or his ass, or anything which belongs to your neighbor.   

18. And all the people saw the thunders, and the lightnings, and the sound of the ram's horn, and the smoking mountain. And the people looked, and they trembled, and they stood from a distance.

19. And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will hear. And let us not speak with God, that we not die.

20. And Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid, for God has come in order to test you, and so that His fear may be on your faces, that you may not sin.

21. And the people stood from a distance, and Moses went near the thick darkness where God was .   

22. And Jehovah said to Moses, You shall say this to the sons of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens.

23. You shall not make gods of silver along with Me, and you shall not make gods of gold for yourselves.

24. You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on it, your sheep and your cattle. In every place in which I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and will bless you.

25. And if you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build them of cut stones. When you swing your tool on it, you defile it.

26. And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be uncovered on it.  

## Exodus 21

1. And these are the judgments which you shall put before them:

2. When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years And in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

3. If he comes in with his body, he shall go out with his body. If he was the husband of a wife, his wife shall go out with him.

4. If his master gives him a wife, and she bears sons or daughters to him, the wife and her children shall belong to her master; and he shall go out with his body.

5. And if the slave truly says, I love my master, my wife and my children; I do not desire to go out free,

6. his master shall bring him to God, and one shall bring him to the door, or to the doorpost; and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.

7. And when a man sells his daughter for a slave-girl, she shall not go out as the male slaves go out.

8. If she is bad in the eyes of her master who has appointed her for himself, he shall allow her redemption. He shall not have power to sell her to a strange people, in his deceiving her.

9. And if he chooses her for his son, he shall do to her as is the custom of daughters.

10. If he takes another for himself, her flesh, her clothing, and her conjugal right shall not be diminished.

11. And if he does not do these three for her, she shall go out for nothing, without silver.   

12. He that strikes a man so that he dies, surely he shall be put to death.

13. And he who does not lie in wait, and God lets fall into his hand, I will appoint a place for you where he may flee.

14. And when a man seethes insolently against his neighbor, to kill him by deceit, you shall take him from My altar to die.

15. And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

16. And he that steals a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

17. And he who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death.

18. And when men strive, and one strikes his neighbor with a stone, or with a fist, and he does not die, but falls on his bed,

19. if he rises and walks about in the street on his staff, the one who struck him shall be innocent; only he shall pay his sitting; surely he shall pay for his healing.

20. And if a man strikes his male slave or his slave-girl with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be avenged.

21. But if he continues a day or two, he shall not be avenged, for he is his silver.   

22. And when men fight, and they strike a pregnant woman, and her child goes forth, and there is no injury, surely he shall be fined. As much as the husband of the woman shall put on him, even he shall give through the judges.

23. But if injury occurs, you shall give life for life,

24. eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

25. branding for branding, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

26. And when a man strikes the eye of his male slave, or the eye of his slave-girl and destroys it, he shall send him away free for his eye.

27. And if he causes the tooth of his male slave, or the tooth of his slave-girl, to fall out, he shall send him away free for his tooth.

28. And when an ox gores a man so that he dies, the ox shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, and the owner of the ox is innocent.

29. And if he was an ox apt to gore from yesterday and the third day, and its owner is given warning, and he does not watch him, and he kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.

30. If a ransom is put on him, he shall give the redemption of his life, according to all which is put on him.

31. Whether he gores a son or he gores a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.

32. If the ox gores a male slave or a slave-girl, he shall give thirty silver shekels to his master, and the ox shall be stoned.

33. And when a man opens a pit, or when a man digs a pit, and does not cover it, and an ox or an ass falls into it,

34. the owner of the pit shall pay; he shall give silver to its owner, and the dead shall be his.

35. And when a man's ox strikes against the ox of his neighbor, and it dies, they shall sell the living ox, and they shall divide the silver; and they shall also divide the dead.

36. Or if it was known that he was an ox apt to gore from yesterday and the third day, and his owner does not watch him, he shall pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his.  

## Exodus 22

1. When a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it, he shall pay five cattle for the ox, and four sheep for the sheep.

2. If the thief is found breaking in, and is stricken and dies, no blood shall be shed for him.

3. If the sun has risen on him, blood is due for him; surely he shall repay. If he has nothing, then he should be sold for his theft.

4. If the stolen thing is surely found in his hand alive, from ox to ass to flock animal, he shall pay double.

5. When a man consumes a field or a vineyard, and he lets his beast loose and it consumes another's field, he shall repay the best of his field and the best of his vineyard.

6. When fire breaks out and finds thorns, and shocked grain, or standing grain, or the field is burned up, surely the one kindling the fire shall repay.   

7. When a man gives silver or vessels to his neighbor to keep, and it is stolen from the man's house, if the thief is found, he shall repay double.

8. If the thief is not found, the master of the house shall be brought to God, whether or not he put out his hand to his neighbor's goods.

9. In every case of trespass, for ox, for ass, for sheep, for clothing, for anything lost of which it is said that it is his, the case of both of them shall come to God. Whom God declares guilty, he shall repay double to his neighbor.

10. When a man gives an ass or an ox to his neighbor; or a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies, or is injured, or is captured, no one seeing it,

11. an oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, that he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods. And its owner shall take it, and he shall not repay.

12. And if it is indeed stolen from him, he shall repay to its owner.

13. If it is completely torn in pieces, he shall bring it as a witness; he shall not repay that which was torn.

14. And when a man borrows from his neighbor, and it is hurt, or dies, its owner not being with it, surely he shall repay.

15. If its owner is with it, he shall not repay. If it is hired, it comes for its hire.   

16. And when a man lures a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he shall surely pay her dowry for a wife to himself.

17. If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he shall weigh money according to the dowry of virgins.

18. You shall not allow a sorceress to live.

19. Anyone lying with an animal, he surely shall be put to death.

20. One sacrificing to a god shall be destroyed, unless it is only to Jehovah.

21. You shall not be violent toward an alien. You shall not oppress him, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.

22. You shall not afflict an orphan or a widow.

23. If you afflict him, if he at all cries to Me, I will surely hear his cry,

24. and My anger shall glow, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall become widows, and your sons orphans.   

25. If you lend money to My people, the poor with you, you shall not be as a money-lender to him; you shall not put interest on him.

26. If you indeed take the clothing of your neighbor as a pledge, you shall return it to him by the going of the sun,

27. for that is his only covering, that is his covering for his skin. In what shall he lie down? And it shall be, when he cries to Me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.

28. You shall not revile God, and you shall not curse a ruler among your people.

29. You shall not delay giving your harvest and your vintage. You shall give to Me the first born of your sons.

30. So you shall do to your oxen, to your sheep: it shall be seven days with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me. And you shall be holy men to Me.

31. Any you shall be holy men to Me. And you shall not eat flesh torn in pieces in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.  

## Exodus 23

1. You shall not utter a false report; You shall not put your hand with the wicked, to become a violent witness.

2. You shall not run after many to gain evil things. And you shall not testify as to a lawsuit, to turn aside after many in order to pervert justice .

3. And you shall not favor the lowly in his lawsuit.

4. When you happen on the ox of your enemy, or his wandering ass, you shall surely return it to him.

5. When you see the ass of one who hates you crouching under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving it to him; you shall surely loose it from him.

6. You shall not pervert the judgment of your needy one in his lawsuit.

7. You shall keep far away from a false matter. And do not kill the innocent and the righteous; for I will not justify the wicked.

8. And you shall not take a bribe, for the bribe blinds the seeing one, and it perverts the words of the righteous.

9. And you shall not oppress an alien; and you know the life of an alien, since you were aliens in the land of Egypt.   

10. And you shall sow your land six years, and you shall gather its produce.

11. And the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, and the needy of your people shall eat. And what they leave, the animals of the field shall eat. So you shall do to your vineyard, to your oliveyard.

12. You shall do your work six days, and on the seventh day you shall rest, so that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your slave-girl and your alien may be refreshed.

13. And be watchful in all that I have said to you. And you shall not mention another god by name; it shall not be heard from your mouth.

14. Three times in the year you shall make a feast to Me.

15. You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread . Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , as I have commanded you, at the set time of the month of Abib. For in it you came out from Egypt, and they shall not appear before Me empty.

16. Also the Feast of Harvest, the first fruits of your labor, of what you sow in the field. Also the Feast of Ingathering, at the end of the year, at your gathering your work from the field.

17. Three times in the year every one of your males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.

18. You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread. And the fat of My feast shall not pass the night until morning.

19. The first, the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.   

20. Behold, I am about to send an Angel before you, to guard you in the way, and to bring you to the place which I have prepared.

21. Be on guard before Him, and listen to His voice. Do not be rebellious against Him, for He will not forgive your transgressions; for My name is in Him.

22. For if you fully listen to His voice, and do all which I speak, I will be an enemy to your enemies, and will be a foe to your foes.

23. For My Angel shall go before you and bring you in to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.

24. You shall not bow down to their gods, and you shall not serve them. And you shall not do according to their works. But you shall surely tear them down, and you shall surely smash their pillars.

25. And you shall serve Jehovah your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will remove sickness from your midst.

12. When you lift up the head of the sons of Israel, of those numbered, each one shall give the ransom of his soul to Jehovah when numbering them; and there shall not be a plague among them when numbering them.

13. They shall give this, everyone passing over to those numbered: half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs being a shekel; half a shekel as an offering to Jehovah.

14. Every one passing over to those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.

15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, to give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.

16. And you shall take the silver of atonement from the sons of Israel and you shall give it to the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and it shall be for the sons of Israel for remembrance before the face of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.   

17. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

18. And you shall make a bronze laver for washing, and its base bronze. And you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar; and you shall put water there.

19. And Aaron and his son shall wash from it, their hands and their feet;

20. as they go into the tabernacle of the congregation they shall wash with water, and shall not die; or as they draw near to the altar to minister, to burn a fire offering to Jehovah.

21. And they shall wash their hands and their feet, and shall not die. And it shall be a never ending statute to them, to him and to his seed for their generations.   

22. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

23. And you take spices for yourself, the best, five hundred of pure myrrh, and its half of spicy cinnamon, two hundred and fifty shekels , and two hundred and fifty of aromatic calamus;

24. and five hundred of cassia, by the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin of olive oil.

25. And you shall make it an oil of holy anointing, ointment compound, the work of a perfumer, an oil of holy anointing it shall be.

26. And you shall anoint with it the tabernacle of the congregation and the ark of the testimony,

27. and the table and all its vessels and the altar of incense,

28. and the altar of burnt offering, and all its vessels, and the laver and its base.

29. And you shall sanctify them, and they shall become most holy; everything touching them shall become holy.

30. And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and you shall consecrate them to minister as priests to Me.

31. And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil for Me for your generations.

32. It shall not be poured on the flesh of man, and you shall not make any like it in its proportion; it is holy. It shall be holy to you.

33. If a man prepares any like it, or who gives from it to a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.

34. And Jehovah said to Moses, Take perfumes for yourself, spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices, and pure frankincense, a part shall be for a part.

35. And you shall make it incense, an ointment, a work of a perfumer, salted, pure and holy.

36. And you shall grind some of it fine, and put some of it in front of the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I meet you. It shall be most holy to you.

37. And the incense which you make, in its proportion, you shall not make for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for Jehovah.

38. If a man makes any like it, to smell of it, the shall be cut off from his people.  

## Exodus 31

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

2. Behold, I have called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, to the tribe of Judah.

3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom, and in intelligence, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship,

4. to devise designs, to work in gold and in silver and in bronze,

5. and in cutting of stones for finishings, and in carving of wood, to work in all workmanship.

6. And behold! I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of every wise-hearted one I have given wisdom; and they shall make all which I have commanded you:

7. the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercyseat which is going up over it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,

8. and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand and all its vessels, and the altar of incense;

9. and the altar of burnt offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base;

10. and the woven garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests;

11. and the oil of anointing, and the incense of perfumes for the sanctuary; according to all which I have commanded you, they shall do.   

12. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

13. And you speak to the sons of Israel, saying, You shall surely keep My sabbaths; for it is a sign between Me and you for your generation; to know that I am Jehovah your sanctifier.

14. And you shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy for you; the profaners of it surely shall be put to death; for everyone doing work in it, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his people.

15. Work may be done six days, and on the seventh day is a sabbath of rest, holy to Jehovah; everyone doing work on the Sabbath day surely shall be put to death.

16. And the sons of Israel shall observe the Sabbath, to do the Sabbath for their generations; it is a never ending covenant.

17. It is a sign forever between Me and the sons of Israel; for in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.

18. And when He finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.  

## Exodus 32

1. And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain. And the people gathered to Aaron. And they said to him, Rise up, make for us gods who may go before our face. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.

2. And Aaron said to them, Break off the rings of gold which are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters; and bring them to me.

3. And all the people broke off the rings of gold in their ears, and they brought to Aaron.

4. And he took them from their hand and formed it with an engraving tool. And he made it a casted calf. And they said, These are your gods, O Israel, who made you go up from the land of Egypt.

5. And Aaron saw, and he built an altar before it. And Aaron called and said, A feast to Jehovah tomorrow.

6. And they rose early on the morrow, and they offered burnt offerings and brought near peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.   

7. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Come, go down, for your people whom you caused to go up from Egypt are corrupted;

8. they have quickly turned off from the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a casted calf and have bowed to it, and have sacrificed to it. And they have said, These are your gods, O Israel, who made you go up from the land of Egypt.

9. And Jehovah said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people.

10. And now leave Me alone that My anger may glow against them, that I may consume them. And I will make you a great nation.

11. And Moses prayed before the face of Jehovah his God, and he said, Why, O Jehovah, does Your anger glow against Your people whom You caused to go up from the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?

12. Why should the Egyptians say, For evil He has caused them to go up, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them on the face of the earth? Turn from Your fierce anger and be moved to pity as to the evil to Your people.

13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and You spoke to them, I will multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens, and all this land which I have said, I will give to your seed. And they shall possess it forever.

14. And Jehovah was moved to pity concerning the evil which He had spoken to do to His people.   

15. And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets written on their two sides, on this and on that side they were written.

16. And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God; it was engraved on the tablets.

17. And Joshua heard the voice of the people in their shouting. And he said to Moses, A sound of war in the camp!

18. And he said, It is not a sound of a cry of might, nor a sound of a cry of defeat; I am hearing the sound of singing.

19. And it happened, as he came near to the camp and saw the calf and dances, the anger of Moses glowed. And he threw the tablets from his hands, and he broke them below the mountain.

20. And he took the calf which they had made and burned it with fire and ground it until it was fine, then he scattered it on the face of the water. And he made the sons of Israel to drink it .   

21. And Moses said to Aaron, What has this people done to you that you have made to come on them a great sin?

22. And Aaron said, Let not anger of my lord glow. You know the people, that it is in evil.

23. And they said to me, Make for us gods who may go before us; as for Moses, the man who caused us to go up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.

24. And I said to them, Whoever has gold, let them break off. And they gave to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.

25. And Moses saw the people, that it was unloosed, for Aaron had let it loose for a derision among their enemies.

26. And Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who is for Jehovah? Come to me! And all the sons of Levi assembled to him.

27. And he said to them, So says Jehovah, God of Israel, each one put his sword on his thigh; pass to and fro from gate to gate in the camp, and each one kill his brother, and each one his neighbor, and each one his kindred.

28. And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And about three thousand men of the people fell on that day.

29. And Moses said, Fill your hand today for Jehovah, since each one has been against his son and against his brother, and in order to give you a blessing today.   

30. And it happened on the morrow, Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.

31. And Moses went back to Jehovah and said, Oh, this people has sinned a great sin, and they have made for themselves gods of gold.

32. And now if You will, lift up their sin. And if not, I pray, blot me out from Your book which You have written.

33. And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him from My book.

34. And now go, lead the people to that place which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before your face. And in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin on them.

35. And Jehovah plagued the people because they made the calf, which Aaron made.  

## Exodus 33

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Come, go up from here, you and the people whom you have caused to go up out from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed.

2. And I will send an angel before your face, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite;

3. to a land flowing with milk and honey. For I will not go up among you, for you are a stiffnecked people, lest I consume you in the way.

4. And the people heard this evil word, and they mourned, and did not put any ornaments on themselves.

5. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, You are a stiffnecked people; in one instant I will go up among you and I will consume you. And now lay off from you your ornaments, that I may know what I shall do to you.

6. And the sons of Israel pulled off their ornaments, from Mount Horeb.   

7. And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, far off from the camp. And he called it the tabernacle of the congregation. And it happened that everyone seeking Jehovah went to the tabernacle of the congregation which  was outside the camp.

8. And it happened as Moses went to the tabernacle, the people all rose and stood, each one at the door of his tent. And they looked after Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle.

9. And it happened as Moses went into the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the door of the tabernacle. And He spoke with Moses.

10. And all the people would see the pillar of the cloud standing at the door of the tabernacle. And all the people rose and bowed themselves, each one at the door of his tent.

11. And Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp. And his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man did not leave the middle of the tabernacle.   

12. And Moses said to Jehovah, Behold, You are saying to me, Cause this people to go up. And You, You have not told me whom You will send with me. And yet You have said, I know you by name, and also you have found favor in My eyes.

13. And now, if I have found favor in Your eyes, please make me see Your ways, and let me know You, so that I may find favor in Your eyes; and consider that this nation is Your people.

14. And He said, My presence will go with you , and I will give you rest.

15. And the said to Him, If Your presence does not go, do not cause us to go up from here.

16. And now by what can it be known that I and Your people have found favor in Your eyes? Is it not in Your going with us? And we are distinguished, I and Your people, from all the nations which are on the face of the earth?

17. And Jehovah said to Moses, This thing which you have spoken I will do. For you have found favor in My eyes, and I know you by name.

18. And he said, I pray, let me see Your glory.

19. And He said, I will cause all My goodness to pass before your face. And I will call out the name of Jehovah before your face. And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.

20. And he said, You are not able to see My face; for no man can see Me and live.

21. And Jehovah said, Behold, a place by Me! And you shall stand on a rock.

22. And as My glory is passing it will be that I will put you in a cleft of the rock; and I will cover My palm over you during My passing.

23. And I will remove My palm, and you shall see My back; but My face cannot be seen.  

## Exodus 34

1. And Jehovah said to Moses, Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone, like the former. And I will write on the tablets the words which were on the former tablet, which you broke.

2. And be prepared in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai. And place yourself here by Me, on the top of the mountain.

3. And a man shall not go up with you. And also let no man be seen on all the mountain. Also do not allow the flocks and the herds to feed before that mountain.

4. And he cut out two tablets of stone like the former. And Moses rose early in the morning and went up into Mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him. And he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.   

5. And Jehovah came down in the cloud. And he placed himself there with Him, and he called on the name of Jehovah.

6. And Jehovah passed by before his face and called out: Jehovah! Jehovah God! Merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and great in goodness and truth,

7. keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and not leaving entirely unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on sons, and on sons of sons, to the third and to the fourth generation.

8. And Moses hurried and bowed to the earth and worshiped.

9. And he said, If now I have found favor in Your eyes, O lord, please let my lord go in our midst, for it is a stiffnecked people; and You forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take us as a possession.   

10. And He said, Behold, I am cutting a covenant; I will do wonderful things before all your people which not have been done in all the earth, and among all nations. And all the people in whose midst you are shall see the work of Jehovah, for that which I am about to do is awesome.

11. Take heed for yourself what I am commanding you today. Behold, I am about to drive out from before your face the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

12. Take heed to yourself, hat you not cut a covenant with the people of the land to which you are going in, that it not be a snare in your midst.

13. But you shall cut down their altars, break their pillars, and you shall cut off their Asherim.

14. For you shall not bow to another god, for Jehovah whose name is Jealous, He is a jealous God;

15. that you not cut a covenant with the people of the land, and they fornicate with their gods, and they call to you, and you eat from his sacrifice;

16. and you take from their daughters for your sons. and their daughters fornicate with their gods, and they lead your sons to fornicate with their gods.

17. You shall not make for yourself casted gods.   

18. You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread ; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread , which I commanded you, at the time appointed, the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you went out from Egypt.

19. Every one opening the womb is Mine, and all your male livestock, a firstling of ox or sheep,

20. and a firstling of an ass, you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you do not redeem, you shall break its neck. You shall redeem every first-born of your sons, and they shall not be seen before My face empty.

21. You may work six days, and on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.

22. And you shall observe a Feast of Weeks for yourself, the firstfruits of the harvest of wheat; also the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.

23. Three times in the year every male of yours shall be seen before the face of the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.

24. For I will expel nations from before your face and will make broad your territory; and no one shall covet your land, as you go up to appear before Jehovah your God three times in the year.

25. You shall not slaughter the blood of my sacrifice on leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice of the Passover Feast pass the night until morning.

26. You shall bring the first of the firstfruits of your ground to the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a kid in the milk of its mother.

27. And Jehovah said to Moses, Write these words for yourself, for on the mouth of these words I will cut a covenant with you and with Israel.   

28. And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread and he did not drink water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.

29. And it happened as Moses was going down from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony being in Moses' hand as he went down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face had become luminous through His speaking with him.

30. And Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses. And, behold! The skin of his face had become luminous. And they were afraid to draw near to him.

31. And Moses called to them. And Aaron and all the leaders among the congregation turned back to him. And Moses spoke to them.

32. And afterwards all the sons of Israel drew near. And he commanded them all which Jehovah had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.

33. And Moses finished speaking with them, and he put a veil on his face.

34. And as Moses came in before Jehovah to speak with Him, he took off the veil until he went out. And he would go out and speak to the sons of Israel that which he was commanded.

35. And the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face had become luminous. And Moses would put back the veil on his face until he went in to speak with Him.  

## Exodus 35

1. And Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel and said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded, to do them:

2. Work may be done six days and on the seventh day it shall be holy to you, a sabbath of rest to Jehovah; everyone doing work in it shall be put to death.

3. You shall not kindle a fire in all your dwellings on the day of the Sabbath.

4. And Moses said to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying:

5. Take from among you an offering to Jehovah. Everyone willing of heart shall bring it, the offering of Jehovah: gold and silver and bronze,

6. and blue, and purple, and crimson, and bleached linen , and goats' hair ,

7. and rams' skins dyed red, and dugong skins, and acacia wood,

8. and oil for the light, and spices for the oil of anointing, and for the incense of perfumes;

9. and onyx stones, and stones of settings, for the ephod and for the breast pocket.

10. And every wise-hearted one among you, let them come and make all which Jehovah has commanded;

11. the tabernacle, its tent, and its cover, its hooks, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;

12. the ark, and its poles, the mercyseat and the veil of the covering,

13. the table and its poles, and all its vessels, and the Bread of the Presence;

14. and the lampstand of the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil of the light;

15. and the incense altar and its poles, and the oil of anointing, and the incense of perfumes, and the screen of the door, at the door of the tabernacle;

16. the altar of burnt offering, and its bronze grating, its poles, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;

17. the screens of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;

18. the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;

19. the woven garments to minister in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons, to minister as priests.   

20. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel went out from Moses.

21. And they came, every one whose heart was lifted up, and everyone whose spirit made him willing. They brought the offering of Jehovah for the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.

22. And the men came in together with the women, everyone willing of heart. They brought in bracelets, and nose rings, and rings, and ornaments, every gold article, and every one who waved a wave offering of gold to Jehovah.

23. And everyone with whom blue was found, and purple, and crimson, and bleached linen , and goats' hair , and rams' skins dyed red, and dugong skins, they brought.

24. Everyone rising up with an offering of silver and bronze, they brought the offering of Jehovah; and everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, they brought.

25. And every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands; and they brought spun yarn, blue, and purple, and crimson and bleached linen .

26. And all the women whose hearts were lifted up in wisdom spun the goats' hair .

27. And the leaders brought the onyx stones, and stones for the setting, for the ephod and for the breast pocket,

28. and the spice, and the oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the incense of the perfumes.

29. And every man and woman whose hearts made them willing to bring for all the work which Jehovah commanded to be done by the hand of Moses; the sons of Israel brought a willing offering to Jehovah.   

30. And Moses said to the sons of Israel, Behold! Jehovah has called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.

31. And He has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in intelligence, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship,

32. and to devise designs, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,

33. and in cuttings of stones for finishings, and in carving of wood, to work in all workmanship of design.

34. And He has put in his heart to teach, he and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,

35. He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to do every work of a smith, and an artisan, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in crimson, and in bleached linen , and a weaver; doers of every work and devisers of designs.  

## Exodus 36

1. And Bezaleel and Aholiab shall work with everyone wise of heart to whom Jehovah has given wisdom and intelligence, to know how to do every work of the service of the sanctuary, concerning all which Jehovah had commanded.

2. And Moses called to Bezaleel, and to Aholiab, and to everyone wise of heart, to whom Jehovah had given a heart of wisdom, everyone whose heart had lifted him up to come near the work, to do it.

3. And they took every offering before Moses which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service in the holy place, to do it. And they brought to him still more willing offerings morning by morning.

4. And all the wise men came, those doing every kind of work for the sanctuary, each one from his work they were doing.

5. And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people are bringing more than enough for the service of the work that Jehovah commanded, to do it.

6. And Moses commanded, and they caused it to be voiced in the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more offering for the sanctuary; and the people were held back from bringing.

7. And their property was sufficient for all the work, to do it, and it was too much.   

8. And every wise-hearted one among the doers of the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains, twined, bleached linen , and blue, and purple, and crimson; he made them with cherubs, the work of an artisan.

9. The length of one curtain was twenty eight by the cubit; and the width was four by the cubit; the one curtain was the same measure for all the curtains.

10. And he joined five curtains one to another; and he joined five curtains one to another.

11. And he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain, from the end to the juncture; so he did at the edge of the last curtain at the second juncture.

12. He made fifty loops on one curtain; and he made fifty loops on the end of the curtain which was at the second juncture; the loops corresponded, one with another.

13. And he made fifty hooks of gold; and he joined the curtains by the hooks, one to another. And the tabernacle became one.   

14. And he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made them eleven curtains.

15. The length of the one curtain was thirty by the cubit, and four cubits the width of the one curtain; one measure to the eleven curtains.

16. And he joined the five curtains separately, and the six curtains separately.

17. And he made fifty loops on the edge of the last curtain at the juncture; and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that joined the second.

18. And he made fifty bronze hooks to join the tent, to unite it in one.

19. And he made a cover for the tent of rams' skins dyed red; and a cover of dugong skins from above.

20. And he made the boards for the tabernacle, standing planks of acacia wood.

21. The length of the board was ten cubits, and a cubit and a half was the width of the one board.

22. The one board was connected by two pins, one to another; so he did to all the boards of the tabernacle.

23. And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward.

24. And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under the one board for its two pins.

25. And for the second side of the tabernacle, to the north side, he made twenty boards,

26. and their forty silver sockets; two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board.

27. And he made six boards for the sides of the tabernacle westward.

28. And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle, in the sides.

29. And they were double from below, and in like manner they were complete to its top, to the first ring. So he did to both of them, for the two corners.

30. And there were eight boards, and their silver sockets, sixteen sockets; two sockets and two sockets under the one board.

31. And he made bars of acacia wood; five to the boards of the second side of the tabernacle;

32. and five bars to the boards of the sides of the tabernacle westward.

33. And he made the middle bar to go through the middle of the boards, from end to end.

34. And he overlaid the boards with gold. And he made the rings gold, housing for the poles; and he overlaid the bars with gold.   

35. And he made a veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and twined, bleached linen . He made it the work of an artisan, with cherubs

36. And he made four pillars of acacia for it. And he overlaid them with gold, their hooks gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.

37. And he made a screen for the door of the tabernacle, blue, and purple, and crimson, and twined, bleached linen , the work of an embroiderer;

38. and its five pillars, and their hooks; and the overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; and their five sockets bronze.  

## Exodus 37

1. And Bezaleel made the ark of acacia wood; two cubits and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.

2. And he overlaid it with pure gold, inside and outside. And he made for it a wreath of gold all around.

3. And he cast four rings of gold for it, on its four feet; two rings on its one side and two rings on its second side.

4. And he made poles of acacia wood; and he overlaid them with gold.

5. And he put the poles into the rings, on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.

6. And he made a mercyseat of pure gold; two cubits and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide.

7. And he made two cherubs of gold; he made them of beaten work, from the two ends of the mercyseat;
