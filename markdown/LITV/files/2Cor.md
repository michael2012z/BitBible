# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God being in Corinth, with all the saints being in all Achaia,

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.   

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,

4. the One comforting us on all our affliction, for us to be able to comfort those in every affliction, through the comfort by which we ourselves are comforted by God.

5. Because the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.

6. But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, being worked out in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort and salvation;   

7. and our hope for you is certain, knowing that even as you are sharers of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.

8. For, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant as to our affliction having happened to us in Asia, that we were excessively pressed down beyond our power, so as for us even to despair of living.

9. But we ourselves have the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust on ourselves, but on God, the One raising the dead,

10. who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we have hope that He will still deliver us ,

11. you also laboring together for us in prayer, that the gracious gift by many persons be the cause of thanksgiving through many for us.   

12. For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we had our conduct in the world in simplicity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you.

13. For we do not write other things to you than what you read or even recognize; and I hope that you will recognize even to the end,

14. even as you also in part recognized us, that we are your glorying, even as also you are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.   

15. And in this confidence, I purposed to come to you before now, that you might have a second benefit,

16. and to go through you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you and to be set forward by you to Judea.

17. Then purposing this, did I indeed use lightness? Or what I purposed, did I purpose according to flesh, that may be with me yes, yes, and no, no?

18. But God is faithful, that our word to you did not become yes and no.

19. For Jesus Christ the Son of God, the One proclaimed among you by us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but has been yes in Him.

20. For as many promises as are of God, in Him they are yes, and in Him are Amen, for glory to God through us.

21. But He confirming us and anointing us with you in Christ is God,

22. even He having sealed us, and having given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

23. And I call God as witness to my soul that to spare you I came no more to Corinth.

24. Not that we rule over your faith, but we are fellow-workers of your joy. For by faith you stand.  

## 2 Corinthians 2

1. But I decided this within myself, not to come to you again in grief.

2. For if I grieved you, who yet will be making me glad, if not the one being grieved by me?

3. And I wrote this same thing to you, lest coming I might have grief from those of whom I ought to rejoice, trusting in you all that my joy is the joy of all of you.

4. For out of much affliction and agony of heart I wrote to you, through many tears, not that you be grieved, but that you know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.   

5. But if anyone has grieved, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I not overbear all of you.

6. This censure by the majority is enough for such a one.

7. So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort such a one, that he not be swallowed up by the overflowing grief.

8. So I beseech you to confirm your love to him.

9. For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if you are obedient in all things.

10. But to whom you forgive anything, I also. For also if I have forgiven anything, of whom I have forgiven it, it is for you, in Christ's person,

11. so that we should not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his devices.   

12. And coming to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,

13. I had no ease in my spirit at my not finding my brother Titus, but saying farewell to them, I went out to Macedonia.

14. But thanks be to God, He always leading us in triumph in Christ, and the One revealing through us the odor of the knowledge of Him in every place.

15. For we are a sweet smell to God because of Christ in those being saved, and in those being lost;

16. to the one, an odor of death unto death, and to the other, an odor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?

17. For we are not as the many, hawking the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God. We speak in Christ, in the sight of God.  

## 2 Corinthians 3

1. Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we, as some, need commendatory letters to you, or commendatory ones from you?

2. You are our letter, having been inscribed in our hearts, being known and being read by all men,

3.  it having been made plain that you are Christ's letter, served by us, not having been inscribed by ink, but by the Spirit of the living God, not in tablets of stone, but in fleshly tablets of the heart.

4. And we have such confidence through Christ toward God;

5. not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reason out anything as out of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,   

6. who also made us able ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.

7. But if the ministry of death having been engraved in letters in stone was with glory, so as the sons of Israel could not gaze into "the face of Moses" because of the glory of his face, which was to cease, Ex. 34:34

8. how much rather the ministry of the Spirit will be in glory!

9. For if the ministry of condemnation was glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.

10. For even that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.

11. For if the thing done away was through glory, much rather the thing remaining is in glory.   

12. Then having such hope, we use much boldness.

13. And not as "Moses, who put a veil over his face," for the sons of Israel not to gaze at the end of the thing being done away. Ex. 34:35

14. But their thoughts were hardened, for until the present the same veil remains on the reading of the Old Covenant, not being unveiled, that it is being done away in Christ.

15. But until today, when Moses is being read, a veil lies on their heart.

16. But whenever it turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Ex. 34:34

17. And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom.

18. But we all with our face having been unveiled, having beheld the glory of the Lord in a mirror, are being changed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord Spirit.  

## 2 Corinthians 4

1. Therefore, having this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we do not faint.

2. But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God, but by the revelation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.

3. But also if our gospel is being hidden, it has been hidden in those being lost,

4. in whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the brightness of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.

5. For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your slaves for the sake of Jesus.

6. Because it is God who said, "Out of darkness Light shall shine," who shone in our hearts to give the brightness of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. Isa. 42:6, 7, 16

7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not from us;   

8. in every way being troubled, but not having been hemmed in; having been perplexed, but not utterly at a loss;

9. being persecuted, but not having been forsaken; being thrown down, but not having been destroyed;

10. always bearing about the dying of the Lord Jesus in the body, that also the life of Jesus may be revealed in our body.

11. For we who live are always being delivered up to death on account of Jesus, that also the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh;

12. so that death indeed works in us, and life in you.

13. But having the same spirit of faith, according to what has been written, "I believed, therefore I spoke," we also believe, therefore we also speak, LXX-Psa. 115:1; MT-Psa. 116:10

14. knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up through Jesus, and will present us with you.

15. For all things are for your sake, that the super abounding grace may be made to abound through the thanksgiving of the greater number, to the glory of God.

16. Because of this, we do not faint, but if indeed our outward man is being decayed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.

17. For the lightness of our present affliction works out for us an eternal weight of glory, surpassing moment by surpassing moment ;

18. we not considering the things seen, but the things not being seen; for the things being seen are not lasting, but the things not being seen are everlasting.  

## 2 Corinthians 5

1. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in Heaven.

2. For indeed in this we groan, greatly desiring to be clothed with our dwelling place out of Heaven,

3. if indeed in being clothed, we shall not be found naked.

4. For indeed, being in the tabernacle, we groan, having been weighted down, inasmuch as we do not wish to be unclothed, but to be clothed, so that the mortal may be swallowed up by the life.

5. And He having worked in us for this same thing is God, who also is giving us the earnest of the Spirit.

6. Then always being fully assured, and knowing that being at home in the body we are away from home from the Lord

7. (for we walk by faith, not by sight),

8. we are fully assured, then, and are pleased rather to go away from home out of the body, and to come home to the Lord.

9. Because of this, we also are striving to be pleasing to Him, whether being at home, or being away from home.

10. For we all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive the things done through the body, according to what he did, whether good or bad.

11. Then knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and we have been manifest to God; and I also hope to have been manifest in your consciences.   

12. For we do not again commend ourselves to you, but are giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that you may have it toward those boasting in appearance and not in heart.

13. For if we are insane, it is to God; or if we are in our senses, it is for you.

14. For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that if One died for all, then the all died;

15. and He died for all, that the living ones may live no more to themselves, but to the One having died for them and having been raised.   

16. So as we now know no one according to flesh, but even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we no longer know Him so .

17. So that if anyone is in Christ, that one is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new!

18. And all things are of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and having given to us the ministry of reconciliation,

19. whereas God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not charging their trespasses to them, and putting the word of reconciliation in us.

20. Then on behalf of Christ, we are ambassadors, as God is exhorting through us, we beseech on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.

21. For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.  

## 2 Corinthians 6

1. But working together, we also call on you not to receive the grace of God in vain.

2. For He says, "In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time! Behold, now is the day of salvation! Isa. 49:8

3.  We are not giving a cause of stumbling, in nothing, that the ministry may not be blamed,

4. but in everything commending ourselves as God's servants, in much patience, in afflictions, in emergencies, in difficulties,

5. in stripes, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings,

6. in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love,

7. in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

8. through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;

9. as unknown, and yet well known, as dying, and yet , look, we live; as flogged, and yet not put to death;

10. as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.   

11. Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart has been made larger.

12. You are not restrained in us, but you are restrained in your own bowels.

13. But for the same reward, (I speak as to children), you also be made larger.

14. Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership does righteousness have with lawlessness? And what fellowship does light have with darkness?

15. And what agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?

16. And what agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a temple of the living God, even as God said, "I will" dwell in them and "walk among them , and I will be their God, and they shall be My people." Lev. 26:12; Ezek. 37:27

17. Because of this, "come out from among them" "and be separated," says the Lord, "and do not touch the unclean thing," and I will receive you. Isa. 52:11

18. "And I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons" and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty. 2 Sam. 7:8, 14; Isa. 43:6  

## 2 Corinthians 7

1. Then having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

2. Make room for us. We wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we overreached no one.

3. I do not speak to condemnation, for I have said before that you are in our hearts, for us to die together and to live together.

4. My boldness toward you is great. My boasting on your behalf is much. I have been filled with comfort; I overflow with joy on all our trouble.   

5. For, indeed, we coming into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but being troubled in every way, with fightings on the outside and fears on the inside.

6. But He who comforts the lowly comforted us by the presence of Titus.

7. And not only by his presence, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted over you, telling us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so as for me to rejoice more.

8. For even if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret, if indeed I did regret, for I see that letter grieved you for an hour.

9. Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to God, that you might suffer loss in nothing by us.

10. For the grief according to God works repentance to salvation, not to be regretted. But the grief of the world works out death.

11. For behold this same thing, you being grieved according to God, how much it worked out earnestness in you, but also defense, but also indignation, but also fear, but also desire, but also zeal, but also vengeance! In everything you commended yourselves to be clear in the matter.   

12. Then even if I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did wrong, nor for the sake of him having suffered wrong, but for the sake of revealing our earnestness on your behalf, for you before God.

13. For this reason we have been comforted in your comfort, and we rather rejoice more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.

14. Because if I have boasted anything to him about you, I was not ashamed. But as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting as to Titus became truth.

15. And his tender feelings are abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of all of you, as you received him with fear and trembling.

16. Therefore, I rejoice, that in everything I am fully assured in you.  

## 2 Corinthians 8

1. But, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given among the churches of Macedonia,

2. that in much testing of trouble, the overflowing of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded to the riches of their generosity.

3. For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability, they willingly gave ,

4. with much entreating, begging us that they might receive of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.

5. And not as we hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God,

6. for us to call on Titus, that even as he began before, so also he might complete this grace to you also.   

7. But even as you abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love in us, that you also should abound in this grace.

8. I do not speak according to command, but through the earnestness of others and testing the trueness of your love.

9. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich, He became poor for your sake, so that you might become rich by the poverty of that One.

10. And I give judgment in this, for this is profitable for you, who began before not only to do, but also to be willing from last year.

11. But now also finish the doing of it , so that even as there was the eagerness in the willing, so also the finishing, giving out of what you have.

12. For if the eagerness is present, it is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.

13. For it is not that there may be ease to others, but trouble to you;

14. but by equality in the present time, your abundance for their need; but also that their abundance may be for your need, that there may be equality;

15. even as it has been written, "He gathering much, he had nothing left over, and he gathering little had no less." Ex. 16:18   

16. But thanks be to God, who gives the same earnestness for you in the heart of Titus.

17. For truly he received the entreating, but being more earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.

18. But we sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,

19. and not only so , but also he having been chosen by the churches as a traveling companion to us with this gift being ministered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself, and your eagerness,

20. avoiding this, lest anyone should blame us in this bounty being ministered by us;

21. providing right things not only before the Lord, but also before men. Prov. 3:4

22. And we sent with them our brother whom we often proved in many things to be earnest, and now much more earnest by the great assurance which I have toward you.

23. If any asks about Titus, he is my partner and a fellow worker for you; or about our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.

24. Then show them a proof of your love and of our boastings toward you, even in the sight of the churches.  

## 2 Corinthians 9

1. For indeed concerning the ministry to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you.

2. For I know your eagerness, of which I boast to Macedonia on your behalf, that Achaia has made ready from last year, and your zeal arouses the greater number.

3. But I sent the brothers that our boasting which is on your behalf should not be in vain in this respect, that as I said, you were ready;

4. lest if Macedonians come with me and find you not ready, that we (we do not say you) should be ashamed in this assurance of boasting.

5. Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they go forward to you and arrange beforehand your promised blessing, this to be ready, thus as a blessing and not as greediness.   

6. And this: the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing on hope of blessings will also reap on blessings.

7. Each one as he purposes in his heart, not out of grief or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver. Prov. 22:8

8. And God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that in everything, always having all self sufficiency, you may abound to every good work;

9. even as it has been written, "He scattered, he gave to the poor, his righteousness abides forever." Psa. 112:9

10. Now He that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating, may He supply and multiply your seed and increase the fruits of your righteousness,

11. in everything you being enriched to all generosity, which works out thanksgiving to God through us.

12. Because the ministry of this service is not only making up the things lacking of the saints, but also multiplying through many thanksgivings to God,

13. through the proof of this service, they glorifying God by your freely expressed submission to the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of the fellowship toward them and toward all;

14. and in their prayer for you, a longing after you, because of the overflowing grace of God on you.

15. But thanks be to God for His unspeakable free gift.  

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. And I myself, Paul, call on you through the meekness and gentleness of Christ (I, who indeed to look upon am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you);

2. but I ask, not being present, that I may be bold with the confidence which I think to be daring against some, those having thought of us as walking according to flesh.

3. For walking about in flesh, we do not war according to flesh;

4. for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful to God in order to pull down strongholds,

5. pulling down imaginations and every high thing lifting up itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of Christ,

6. and having readiness to avenge all disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled.   

7. Do you look at things according to appearance? If anyone has persuaded himself to be of Christ, let him think this again as to himself, that as he is of Christ, so also we are of Christ.

8. For even if I also somewhat more fully should boast about our authority (which the Lord gave us for building up and not for pulling you down), I will not be put to shame;

9. so that I may not seem to frighten you by letters.

10. Because, they say, the letters are weighty and strong, but the bodily presence is weak, and his speech being despised.

11. Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word through letters, being absent, such we are also being present in deed.   

12. For we dare not rank or compare ourselves with some of those commending themselves, but they measuring themselves among themselves and comparing themselves to themselves, are not perceptive.

13. But we will not boast beyond measure, but according to measure of the rule which the God of measure distributed to us, to reach even to you.

14. For we do not overstretch ourselves as if not reaching to you, for we also came to you in the gospel of Christ,

15. not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others, but having hope that the growing faith among you will be made larger according to our rule, to overflowing,

16. in order to preach the gospel to that beyond you, not to boast in another's rule in things ready.

17. "But the one glorying, let him glory in" the "Lord." Jer. 9:24

18. For not the one commending himself is the one approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.  

## 2 Corinthians 11

1. I would that you were bearing with me a little in foolishness; but, indeed, bear with me.

2. For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God. For I have promised you to one Man, to present you a pure virgin to Christ.

3. But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the purity which is due to Christ.

4. For if, indeed, the one coming proclaims another Jesus, whom we have not proclaimed, or if you receive another spirit which you have not received, or another gospel which you never accepted, you might well endure  these .   

5. For I judge myself to have come behind the highest apostles in nothing.

6. But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge. But in every way I have been clearly revealed to you in all things.

7. Or did I commit sin, humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?

8. I stripped other churches, receiving wages for the serving of you.

9. And being present with you and lacking, I was not a burden to anyone. The brothers coming from Macedonia completely made up for my lack. And in every way I kept myself without burden to you , and I will keep myself .

10. The truth of Christ is in me, that this boasting shall not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.

11. Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.

12. But what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, so that in that which they boast, they be found also as we.

13. For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.

14. Did not Satan marvelously transform himself into an angel of light?

15.  It is not a great thing, then, if also his ministers transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.   

16. Again I say, let not anyone think me to be foolish. But if not, even if as foolish, receive me, that I also may boast a little.

17. What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this boldness of boasting.

18. Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.

19. For you gladly endure fools, being wise.

20. For you endure if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours, if anyone takes away from you , if anyone exalts self , if anyone beats you in the face.

21. I speak according to dishonor, as if we have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares (I say it in foolishness), I also dare.   

22. Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they Abraham's seed? I also.

23. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as beside myself.) I being beyond them : in labors, more abundantly; in stripes, beyond measure; in prisons, much more; in deaths, many times.

24. Five times I received forty stripes minus one from the Jews.

25. I was flogged three times; I was stoned once; I was shipwrecked three times; I have spent a night and a day in the deep.

26.  I have been in travels often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my race, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the desert, in dangers on the sea, in dangers among false brothers,

27. in hardship and toil, often in watchings, in hunger and thirst, often in fastings, in cold and nakedness,

28. besides the things outside conspiring against me day by day, the care of all the churches.

29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn?

30. If it is right to boast, I will boast of the things of my infirmity.

31. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, He who is blessed forever, that I am not lying.

32. In Damascus, the governor of Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes, desiring to seize me.

33. And I was let down through a window through the wall in a basket and escaped their hands.  

## 2 Corinthians 12

1. Indeed, to boast is not profitable to me, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.

2. I know a man in Christ fourteen years before--whether in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows--such a one was caught up to the third Heaven.

3. And I know such a man--whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know; God knows--

4. that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not permissible for a man to speak.

5. On behalf of such a one I will boast. But I will not boast on my behalf, except in my weaknesses.

6. For if I desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I speak the truth. But I spare, lest anyone reckons me to be beyond what he sees me or hears of me.

7. And by surpassing revelations, that I not be made haughty, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, that I not be made haughty.

8. Beyond this I entreated the Lord three times, that it depart from me.

9. And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Therefore, I will rather gladly boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may overshadow me.

10. Because of this, I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in dire needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for the sake of Christ. For when I may be weak, then I am powerful.   

11. Boasting, I have become foolish. You compelled me. For I ought to be commended by you, for I lacked nothing of the highest apostles, even though I am nothing.

12. Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in miracles, and in wonders, and by works of power.

13. For what is it in which you were less than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.

14. Behold, I am ready to come to you a third time . And I will not burden you, for I do not seek your things, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.

15. But I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls, even if loving you more and more, I am loved the less.

16. But let it be so, I did not burden you; but being crafty, I caught you with bait.

17. By any whom I have sent to you, did I overreach you by him?

18. I begged Titus and sent the brother with him . Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?

19. Again, do you think we are defending to you? We speak before God in Christ, but in all things for your building up, beloved.

20. For I fear lest somehow coming I not find you as I wish, and I be found by you such as you do not wish; lest somehow there be strifes, envyings, angers, rivalries, evil speakings, whisperings, proud thoughts, disturbances;

21. that in my coming again, my God may not humble me with you, and I shall mourn many of those previously sinning and not repenting over the uncleanness and fornication and lustfulness which they have practiced.  

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. I am coming to you this third time . "In the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter shall be established." Deut. 19:15

2. I said before, and I say beforehand, as being present the second time and being absent now. I write to those previously sinning, and all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare;

3. since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you,

4. (for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God). For even we are weak in Him, yet we shall live by the power of God toward you.

5. Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove yourselves. Or do you not yourselves perceive that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?

6. And I hope you will know that we are not reprobates.   

7. But I pray to God for you not to do evil, none. It is not that we may appear approved, but that you may do the good, and we deemed to be reprobates.

8. For we cannot have any power against the truth, but for the truth.

9. For we rejoice when we are weak and you are powerful. But we pray for this also, your perfection.

10. Because of this, I write these things while absent, that being present I may not deal sharply with you according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for pulling down.   

11. For the rest, brothers, rejoice! Perfect yourselves; encourage yourselves, mind the same thing, be at peace; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

12. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

13. All the saints greet you.

14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
