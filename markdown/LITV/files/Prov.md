## Proverbs 1

1. The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

2. To know wisdom and instruction; to understand the words of understanding;

3. to receive instruction in prudence, justice, and judgment, and uprightness;

4. to give sense to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man.

5. The wise hears and increases learning, and the understanding ones gets wise counsel,

6. to understand a proverb and an enigma; the words of the wise, and their acute sayings.   

7. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.

8. My son, hear your father's instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother;

9. for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains for your neck.   

10. My son, if sinners lure you, do not be willing.

11. If they say, Walk with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us secretly lurk for the innocent without cause,

12. let us swallow them up alive as Sheol; and whole, as those who go down into the Pit,

13. we shall find all precious goods; we shall fill our houses with plunder;

14. cast in your lot among us; one purse shall be to all of us.

15. My son, do not walk in the way with them! Hold back your foot from their path;

16. for their feet run to evil and they haste to shed blood.

17. For in vain the net is spread in the sight of every bird.

18. And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own souls.

19. So are the ways of everyone who gets unjust gain; it takes away its owner's soul.   

20. Wisdom cries aloud outside; she gives her voice in the square;

21. she calls at the head of gathering places; in the opening of the gates, in the city she utters her words:

22. How long will you love to be simple, you simple ones? And will scorners desire scorn for themselves? And will fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn back at my warning; behold, I will pour out my Spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.

24. Because I called, and you refused; I stretch out a hand, and none inclines,

25. but you have ignored all my counsel, and you did not desire my warning.

26. I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your dread comes;

27. when your dread comes like a storm; and your calamity arrives like a tempest, when distress and constraint come on you.

28. Then they shall call on me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.

29. Instead they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of Jehovah.

30. They did not want my counsel; they despised all my reproof,

31. and they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own lusts.

32. For the going astray of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.

33. But he who listens to me shall live securely and shall be at ease from the dread of evil.  

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if you will receive My words, and treasure up My commandments with you,

2. so that you attend to wisdom, you shall extend your heart to understanding.

3. For if you cry for discernment, lifting up your voice for understanding;

4. if you seek her as silver, and search for her as hidden treasures,

5. then you shall understand the fear of Jehovah and find knowledge of God.

6. For Jehovah gives wisdom; out of His mouth are knowledge and understanding.

7. He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to the ones who walk in integrity,

8. to guard the paths of judgment, and He protects the way of His saints.

9. Then you shall understand righteousness and judgment and honesty, yea , every good path.   

10. When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasing to your soul,

11. discretion shall keep you, understanding shall watch over you;

12. to deliver you from the evil way, from the man who speaks perverse things;

13. those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,

14. who rejoice to do evil; they delight in the perversities of the wicked;

15. whose paths are crooked, who are devious in their tracks.

16.  These will deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words,

17. who forsakes the guide of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.

18. For her house leads down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.

19. All going in to her do not return, nor do they reach the ways of life.

20. Then you may walk in the ways of the good and keep the ways of the righteous.

21. For the upright shall live in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.  

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commands,

2. for they shall add length of days and long life and peace to you.

3. Mercy and truth will not forsake you; tie them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart;

4. and you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

5. Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and lean not to your own understanding;

6. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.   

7. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Jehovah and depart from evil.

8. Healing shall be to your navel and marrow to your bones.

9. Honor Jehovah with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase,

10. and your barns shall be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst with new wine.

11. My son, do not reject the chastening of Jehovah, and do not loathe His correction;

12. for whom Jehovah loves He corrects, even as a father corrects the son with whom he is pleased.   

13. Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding.

14. For its profit is better than the gain from silver, and its increase more than fine gold;

15. she is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand; riches and honor in her left hand.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace.

18. She is a tree of life to the ones who lay hold on her; and happy are the ones holding her fast.

19. Jehovah founded the earth by wisdom; He founded the heavens by understanding;

20. the depths were broken up by His knowledge, and the clouds dropped down the dew.   

21. My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and judgment,

22. and they shall be life to your soul, and grace to your neck;

23. then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.

24. When you lie down, you shall not dread; yea, you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.

25. Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of the destruction of the wicked when it comes.

26. For Jehovah shall be at your side, and He shall keep your foot from being caught.   

27. Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it .

28. Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, or, Tomorrow I will give, when you have it beside you.

29. Do not plan evil against your neighbor, since he lives securely by you.

30. Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.

31. Do not envy the cruel man, and choose not among all his ways.

32. For the perverse one is hateful to Jehovah, but His intimacy is with the righteous.

33. The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the just.

34. Surely He scorns the scorners, but He gives grace to the lowly.

35. The wise inherit honor, but the foolish exalt shame.  

## Proverbs 4

1. Sons, hear the instruction of a father, and listen so as to know understanding.

2. For I give you good teaching, do not forsake my law.

3. For I was my father's son, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.

4. And he taught me and said to me, Let your heart cling to my words; keep my commands and live.

5. Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forsake and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.

6. Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will keep you.

7. Wisdom is the main thing; get wisdom, and with all your getting, get understanding.

8. Exalt her, and she will lift you up; she shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.

9. She shall give a wreath of grace to your head; she shall shield you with a crown of glory.

10. Oh my son, hear and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many.

11. I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in the right tracks;

12. when you go, your tracks shall not be narrowed, and when you run, you shall not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of instruction, do not let her go; keep her, for she is your life.   

14. Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not go in the way of evildoers.

15. Avoid it, do not pass by it; turn from it and pass on.

16. For they do not sleep if they have done no evil, and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the just is as a bright light going on and shining till the day is established.

19. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they do not know at what they stumble.   

20. My son, listen to my words; bow your ear to what I say;

21. let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the center of your heart;

22. for they are life to those who find them, and healing to all his flesh.

23. Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

24. Turn away from you the crooked mouth, and put perverse lips far from you.

25. Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids look straight before you.

26. Study the track of your feet, then all your ways will be established.

27. Do not turn to the right hand or to the left; turn your foot aside from evil.  

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, listen to my wisdom; bow your ears to my understanding;

2. So that you may keep judgment, and your lips may keep knowledge.

3. For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her palate is sweeter than oil,

4. but afterwards, she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a sword of mouths;

5. her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell,

6. lest you should meditate on the path of life, her tracks are movable, you cannot know them.

7. Then hear me now, O sons, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.

8. Remove your ways far from her, and do not come near to the door of her house,

9. lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel;

10. that strangers not be filled with your strength, and your labors be in the house of an alien,

11. and you moan when your end comes , when your flesh and muscle are eaten away;

12. and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised correction;

13. and I have not bowed to the voice of my teachers, nor bowed my ears to those instructing me.

14. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.   

15. Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.

16. Should your overflowing springs be scattered outside, like rivers of waters in the streets?

17. Let them be only your own, and not to strangers with you;

18. let your fountains be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth;

19.  she is a loving deer, a graceful doe; let her breasts satisfy you every time, and always be ravished in her love.

20. And my son, why will you be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace a foreigner's bosom?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and He ponders all his tracks.

22. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.

23. He shall die without instruction, and in the greatness of his foolishness he shall go astray.  

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you struck your palms with an alien,

2. you are snared with the words of your mouth; you are captured with the words of your own mouth.

3. My son, do this then, and deliver yourself when you come into the palm of your friend: go lower yourself and be bold to your friend.

4. Do not give sleep to your eyes, or slumber to your eyelids.

5. Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a hand of a hunter , and as a bird from the fowler's hand.   

6. Go to the ant, lazy man; consider her ways and be wise;

7. who, having no guide, overseer or ruler,

8. provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.

9. How long will you lie down, O lazy man? When will you arise out of your sleep?

10. A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down;

11. So shall your poverty come as one walking, and your need like an armed man.   

12. A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,

13. winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, teaching with his fingers.

14. Perversity is in his heart; he is plotting evil at every time, he sends out strife.

15. On account of this, calamity shall come suddenly; he is broken quickly and there is no healing.

16. These six things Jehovah hates; yea, seven are hateful to his soul;

17. a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

18. a heart that plots evil plans, feet hurrying to run to mischief,

19. a false witness who breathes lies, and he who causes strife among brothers.   

20. My son, keep your father's commands, and do not forsake the law of your mother.

21. Tie them to your heart forever; tie them around your neck.

22. When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall watch over you; and when you awaken, it will meditate with you.

23. For the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light; and reproofs of instruction are a way of life,

24. to keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of the strange woman.

25. Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, and do not let her take you with her eyelids,

26. For on account of a woman, a harlot, a man comes to the last loaf of bread, and another man's wife hunts for the precious soul.

27. Can a man take fire into his bosom and his clothes not be burned?

28. Or can a man walk on hot coals and his feet not be burned?

29. So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; everyone touching her shall not be innocent.

30. They do not despise a thief, if he steals to fill his appetite when he is hungry.

31. But if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the goods of his house.

32. He who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart; he who does it is a destroyer of his own soul.

33. He shall find a wound and dishonor, and his shame shall not be wiped away.

34. For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance,

35. He will not lift up the face of every ransom, nor will he consent if you multiply the bribes.  

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.

2. Keep my commands and live, and my law as the pupil of your eye.

3. Tie them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.

4. Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call understanding your kinsman,

5. so that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the alien with her flattering words.   

6. For I looked through my lattice, at the window of my house,

7. and I saw among the simple ones, I observed among the sons a young man lacking heart,

8. passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

9. in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and darkness of night.

10. And, behold, a woman to meet him, with a harlot's dress, and a guarded heart;

11. she is loud and stubborn; her feet do not stay in her own house.

12. At this time she is outside, now in the streets, and she lies in wait at every corner;

13. and she seizes him and kisses him; she hardens her face and says to him,

14. Sacrifices of peace offerings are on me, today I have paid my vows;

15. so I came out to meet you, earnestly to seek your face, and I have found you.

16. I have spread my couch with coverings, with striped cloths of Egyptian linen.

17. I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning, let us delight ourselves with caresses.

19. For my husband is not at his house; he is going in the way, far away.

20. He has taken a bag of silver in his hand; at the day of the full moon he will enter his house.

21. With the sum of her persuasion she turned him aside; with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

22. He goes after her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter; or as one in fetters goes to the correction of a fool,

23. until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare, and not knowing that it is for his soul.   

24. Now, then, listen to me, O sons, and attend to the words of my mouth:

25. Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not go astray in her paths.

26. For many are the wounded she has caused to fall; and plentiful all her slain ones.

27. The ways of Sheol are in her house, leading down to the rooms of death.  

## Proverbs 8

1. Does not wisdom call? And does not understanding speak?

2. She stands in the top of high places, by the wayside, in the houses of the paths,

3. beside the gates; before the entrance of the city, at the doors, she cries.

4. I call to you, O men, and my voice is to the sons of men.

5. Understand wisdom, simple ones; and fools, be of an understanding heart.

6. Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and from the opening of my lips shall be right things.

7. For my mouth shall speak of truth, and wickedness is hateful to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; nothing crooked or perverse is in them;

9. they are all plain to the understanding one; and right to those who find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge, rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than jewels, and all delights cannot be compared to it.   

12. I, wisdom, dwell with sense, and I find knowledge of discretions.

13. The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; I hate pride and loftiness, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth.

14. Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding; I have strength.

15. By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness.

16. Rulers and nobles rule by me, and all the judges of the earth.

17. I love those who love me, and those who seek me early find me.

18. Riches and honor are with me; enduring wealth and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my increase is better than the best silver.

20. I walk in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;

21. to cause those who love me to inherit wealth, and I will fill up their treasuries.   

22. Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way, from then, before His works.

23. I was set up from everlasting, from that which was before the earth.

24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs heavy with water.

25. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth;

26. before He had made the earth and the fields, or the highest part of the dust of the world.

27. When He prepared the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle on the face of the deep,

28. when He set the clouds above, when He made the strong fountains of the deep,

29. when He gave to the sea its limit, that the waters should not beyond His command; when He decreed the foundations of the earth,

30. then I was at His side, like a master workman; and I was His delights day by day, rejoicing before Him at every time;

31. rejoicing in the world, His earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.   

32. And now listen to me, O sons, for blessed are those who keep my ways.

33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.

34. Blessed is the man listening to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

35. For whoever finds me finds life, and he shall obtain favor from Jehovah.

36. But he who sins against me does violence to his own soul; all who hate me love death.  

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars;

2. she has slaughtered her slaughter; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.

3. She has sent out her maidens; she cries on the highest places of the city;

4. The simple one, turn in here; and to one lacking heart, she says to him:

5. Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mixed.

6. Forsake the foolish, and live, and go in the way of understanding.

7. He who reproves a scorner gets shame to himself; and he who rebukes a wicked man gets his own blot.

8. Do not reprove a scorner, that he not hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.

9. Give to a wise one, and he will be more wise; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.

10. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy Ones is understanding.

11. For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.

12. If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it .   

13. A foolish woman is loud; she is thoughtlessness, and she knows not what.

14. And she sits at the door of her house, in a seat in the high places of the city,

15. to call those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways:

16. The simple one, let him turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:

17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.

18. But he does not know that the departed spirits are there; her guests are in the depths of hell.  

## Proverbs 10

1. The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a father rejoice, but the foolish son is his mother's sorrow.   

2. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.

3. Jehovah will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, but He pushes away the desire of the wicked.   

4. He who deals with a lazy palm becomes poor, but the hand of the hard worker makes him rich.   

5. He who gathers in summer is a prudent son; he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.   

6. Blessings are on the head of the just, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.   

7. The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot.   

8. The wise in heart accepts commands, but the foolish of lips shall be thrust away.   

9. He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways shall be found out.   

10. He who winks the eye causes sorrow, but the foolish of lips shall be thrust away.   

11. The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.   

12. Hatred stirs up fights, but love covers all transgressions.   

13. Wisdom is found in the lips of him who has understanding, but a rod is waiting for the back of him who lacks heart.   

14. The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.   

15. The rich man's wealth is his strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty.   

16. The labor of the righteous is for life; the gain of the wicked is for sin.   

17. He who heeds instruction is in the way of life, but he who refuses reproof is going astray.   

18. He who hides hatred with lying lips, and he who sends out a slander, he is a fool.   

19. In the abundance of words transgression does not cease, but one restraining his lips is prudent.   

20. The tongue of the just is as choice silver; the heart of the wicked is as a little.

21. The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of heart.   

22. The blessing of Jehovah, it makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.   

23. To work out evil devices is as laughter to the foolish; so wisdom is to a man of understanding.   

24. That which the wicked fears shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous is granted.

25. As the storm passes, so the wicked is not; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.   

26. Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy one to those who send him.   

27. The fear of Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be cut short.

28. The expectation of the righteous is joyful, but the hope of the wicked shall perish.   

29. The way of Jehovah is strength to the upright, but ruin is to workers of iniquity.

30. The righteous shall never be moved, and the wicked shall not dwell in the land.   

31. The mouth of the just flourishes with wisdom, but the perverse tongue shall be cut off.

32. The lips of the righteous know what is pleasing, but the mouth of the wicked knows only perversities.  

## Proverbs 11

1. False balances are hateful to Jehovah, but a perfect stone His delight.   

2. Pride comes, then shame comes, but with the lowly is wisdom.   

3. The integrity of the upright guides them, but the perversity of traitors will devastate them.   

4. Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.   

5. The righteousness of the perfect shall make his way right, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

6. The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but traitors shall be taken in their lust.   

7. In the death of a wicked man, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of the unjust shall be lost.   

8. The righteous is delivered from distress, and the wicked comes in his place.   

9. The ungodly is corrupting his neighbor with his mouth, but the just is delivered by knowledge.   

10. When the righteous prospers, the city rejoices; and at the wicked's perishing is singing.

11. A city is lifted up by the blessing of the upright, but by the wicked's mouth it is overthrown.   

12. One despising his friend lacks heart, but an understanding man remains silent.

13. One going with slander is a revealer of secrets, but the faithful of spirit keeps a matter hidden.   

14. Without guidance the people fall, but safety is in a great counselor.   

15. One suffers evil when he is surety for a stranger, but one hating strikers of hands is safe.   

16. A gracious woman holds to honor, and terrifying men hold to riches.   

17. A merciful man does good to his own soul, but the cruel troubles his own flesh.   

18. The wicked makes a deceitful wage, but one sowing righteousness has a reward of truth.   

19. So righteousness leads to life, but one pursuing evil, to his death.   

20. Hateful to Jehovah are the perverse hearted, but His delight is the upright in way.   

21.  Though hand join to hand, the evil shall not be innocent, but the righteous seed escapes.   

22.  As a ring of gold in a swine's snout, so is a woman who is beautiful, yet turning aside discretion.   

23. The desire of the righteous is only good, the hope of the wicked is wrath.   

24. There is one who scatters yet increases more; but a withholder of just due comes only to poverty.   

25. The blessed soul will be made fat; he who waters will also drink fully.   

26. One holding back grain, the people curse him; but a blessing is to the head of one selling grain.   

27. He who early is seeking good seeks favor; but one pursuing evil, it shall come to him.   

28. One trusting in his riches, he shall fall; but like a green leaf the righteous shall sprout.   

29. One troubling his house inherits the wind; and the fool is servant to the wise of heart.   

30. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he who takes souls is wise.   

31. Behold, the righteous shall be rewarded in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner.  

## Proverbs 12

1. Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is like a brute animal.   

2. The good obtain grace from Jehovah, but He will condemn a man of wicked devices.   

3. A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.   

4. A woman of virtue is a crown to her lord, but one causing shame is like rottenness in his bones.   

5. The thoughts of the righteous are right; the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
