# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

2. to my beloved child Timothy: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I have thanks to God, whom I worship from my forebears in a pure conscience, how unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day,

4. longing to see you, being reminded of your tears, that I may be filled with joy,

5. taking recollection of the unpretended faith in you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am assured that it is also in you.   

6. For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

7. For God did not give a spirit of cowardice to us, but of power and of love, and of self-control.

8. Then do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, His prisoner. But suffer hardship with the gospel, according to the power of God,

9. He having saved us and having called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,

10. but now revealed through the appearance of our Savior, Jesus Christ, making death of no effect, bringing life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel,

11. for which I was appointed a herald and apostle and a teacher of nations.

12. For which cause I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit until that Day.

13. Hold a pattern of sound words which you heard from me, in faith and love in Christ Jesus.

14. Guard the good Deposit given through the Holy Spirit indwelling in us.   

15. You know this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me, and he was not ashamed of my chain,

17. but having come to Rome, he more diligently sought and found me .

18. May the Lord give to him to find mercy from the Lord in that Day. And what things he served in Ephesus, you know very well.  

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Then my child, you be empowered by grace in Christ Jesus.

2. And what things you heard from me through many witnesses, commit these things to faithful men, such as will be competent also to teach others.

3. Then you suffer hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

4. No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, so that he might please the one enlisting him .

5. And also if anyone competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.

6.  It is right the laboring farmer to partake first of the fruits.

7. Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.   

8. Remember Jesus Christ, having been raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,

9. in which I suffer ill as an evildoer, unto bonds; but the Word of God has not been bound.

10. Because of this, I endure all things on account of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus, with everlasting glory.

11. Faithful is the Word: for if we died with Him , we also shall live with Him ;

12. if we endure, we shall also reign with Him ; if we deny Him , that One will deny us;

13. if we are unfaithful, that One remains faithful; He is not able to deny Himself.   

14. Remind them of these things, solemnly testifying before the Lord not to dispute about words for nothing useful, to the throwing down of those hearing.

15. Earnestly study to present yourself approved to God, a workman unashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

16. But shun profane, empty babblings, for they will go on to more ungodliness,

17. and their word will have growth like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

18. who missed the mark concerning the truth, saying the resurrection already has come, and overturn the faith of some.   

19. However, the foundation of God stands firm, having this seal, " The Lord knew those being His;" Num. 16:5 , also, Let everyone naming the name of Christ depart from unrighteousness.

20. But in a great house not only are there vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor and some to dishonor.

21. Then if anyone purifies himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, having been sanctified and made useful to the Master, having been prepared to every good work.   

22. But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with the ones calling on the Lord out of a pure heart.

23. But refuse the foolish and uninstructed questionings, knowing that they generate quarrels.

24. But a slave of the Lord ought not to quarrel, but to be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,

25. in meekness teaching those who have opposed, if perhaps God may give them repentance for a full knowledge of the truth,

26. and they may awake out of the snare of the Devil, having been taken captive by him, so as to do the will of that one.  

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But know this, that in the last days grievous times will be upon us .

2. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, braggarts, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3. without natural feeling, unyielding, slanderers, without self-control, savage, haters of good,

4. betrayers, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

5. having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these.

6. For of these are those creeping into houses and leading silly women captive, the ones having been heaped with sins, being led away by various lusts,

7. always learning, but never being able to come to a full knowledge of the truth.

8. But in the way Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these withstand the truth, men having been corrupted in mind, found worthless as to the faith.

9. But they will not go further, for their foolishness will be plain to all, as also that of those became.   

10. But you have closely followed my doctrine, the conduct, the purpose, the faith, the long-suffering, the love, the patient endurance,

11. the persecutions, the sufferings, such as happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what persecutions I bore. And the Lord delivered me out of all.

12. And, indeed, all desiring to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

13. But evil men and pretenders will go forward to worse, leading astray and being led astray.

14. But you keep on in what you learned and were assured of, knowing from whom you learned,

15. and that from a babe you know the Holy Scriptures, those being able to make you wise to salvation through belief in Christ Jesus.

16. Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,

17. so that the man of God may be perfected, fully furnished for every good work.  

## 2 Timothy 4

1. Then I solemnly witness before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, He being about to judge living and dead at His appearance and His kingdom:

2. preach the Word, be urgent in season, out of season, convict, warn, encourage with all long-suffering and teaching.

3. For a time will be when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts, they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear;

4. and they will turn away the ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths.

5. But you be clear-minded in all, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully carry out your ministry.

6. For I am already being poured out, and the time of my release is here.

7. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.

8. For the rest, the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me in that Day, and not only to me, but also to all the ones loving His appearance.   

9. Make haste to come to me shortly.

10. For Demas deserted me, loving the present age, and he went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

11. Only Luke is with me. Taking Mark, bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry.

12. But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

13. When you come, bring the cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith demonstrated many evil things to me. The Lord "will give back to him according to his works." LXX-Psa. 61:13; Prov. 24:12; MT-Psa. 62:12

15. You also guard against him , for he greatly withstood our words.   

16. In my first defense no one was beside me, but all deserted me. May it not be reckoned to them.

17. But the Lord stood with me and gave me power, that through me the preaching might be fulfilled, and all the nations might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

18. And the Lord will deliver me from every wicked work and will save me for His heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

19. Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus remained in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.

21. Try to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.

22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
