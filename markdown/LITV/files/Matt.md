# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The Book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:

2. Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.

3. And Judah fathered Pharez and Zarah out of Tamar, and Pharez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Aram,

4. and Aram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,

5. and Salmon fathered Boaz out of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed out of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,

6. and Jesse fathered David the king. And David the king fathered Solomon out of her who had been the wife of Uriah,

7. and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa,

8. and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram, and Jehoram fathered Uzziah,

9. and Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,

10. and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah,

11. and Josiah fathered Jehoiachin and his brothers, at the deportation of Babylon.

12. And after the deportation of Babylon, Jehoiachin fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,

13. and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,

14. and Azor fathered Sadoc, and Sadoc fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,

15. and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,

16. and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband to be of Mary, out of whom Jesus was born, the One called Christ.

17. So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, fourteen generations.   

18. And the birth of Jesus Christ was this way (for His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph) before they came together, she was discovered to be pregnant in womb by the Holy Spirit.

19. But her husband to be Joseph being just, and not willing to make her a public example, he purposed to put her away secretly.

20. And as he was thinking about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord was seen by him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For that in her is fathered by the Holy Spirit.

21. And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.

22. And all this happened so that might be fulfilled that spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23. "Behold! The virgin will conceive in her womb and will bear a son, and they will call His name Emmanuel" (which translated is, God with us). Isa. 7:14

24. And being aroused from sleep, Joseph did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife,

25. and did not know her until she bore her son, the First-born. And he called His name Jesus.  

## Matthew 2

1. And when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men arrived from the east to Jerusalem,

2. saying, Where is He born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.

3. But Herod the king having heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked of them where the Christ was to be born.

5. And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written by the prophet,

6. "And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, in no way are you least among the governors of Judah, for out of you shall come a Governor who shall shepherd My people Israel." Mic. 5:2

7. Then secretly calling the wise men, Herod asked of them exactly the time of the star appearing.

8. And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Having gone, search carefully for the child. And when you find him , bring me word again so that coming I may also worship him.   

9. And having heard the king, they departed. And, behold! The star which they saw in the east went before them until it had come and stood over where the child was.

10. And seeing the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with a great joy.

11. And having come into the house, they saw the child with His mother Mary. And falling down, they worshiped Him. And opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. And having been warned by a dream not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country by another way.   

13. And they having departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph by a dream, saying, Rise up! Take the child and His mother with you, and flee into Egypt. And be there until I shall tell you. For Herod is about to look for the child in order to destroy Him.

14. And rising up, he took along the child and His mother by night and withdrew into Egypt.

15. And he was there until the end of Herod, that might be fulfilled that spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I have called My Son." Hos. 11:1   

16. Then seeing that he was mocked by the wise men, Herod was greatly enraged, and having sent, he killed all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he exactly asked from the wise men.

17. Then was fulfilled that spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

18. "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted, because they were not ." Jer. 31:15   

19. But Herod having expired, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph by a dream in Egypt,

20. saying, Rising up, take along the child and His mother and pass over into the land of Israel; for those seeking the soul of the child have expired.

21. And rising up, he took along the child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.

22. But hearing that Archelaus reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod, he feared to go there. And being warned by a dream, he departed into the parts of Galilee.

23. And coming, he lived in a city called Nazareth, so as to fulfill that spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. No OT passage  

## Matthew 3

1. Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,

2. and saying, Repent! For the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.

3. For this is he spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying: "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord! Make His paths straight!" Isa. 40:3

4. And John himself had his clothing from hairs of a camel, and a belt of leather about his loin. And his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem and all Judea went out to him, and all the neighborhood of the Jordan,

6. and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.   

7. But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Therefore, bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.

9. And do not think to say within yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.

10. But already the axe is even laid at the root of the trees; therefore, any tree not bringing forth good fruit is cut down and is thrown into fire.

11. I indeed baptize you in water to repentance; but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,

12. whose fan is in His hand, and He will cleanse His floor and will gather His wheat into the barn. But He will burn up the chaff with fire that cannot be put out.   

13. Then Jesus arrived from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.

14. But John restrained Him, saying, I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?

15. But answering, Jesus said to him, Allow it now, for it is becoming to us this way to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.

16. And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water. And, behold! The heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God coming down as a dove, and coming upon Him.

17. And behold! A voice out of the heaven saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found delight. Psa. 2:7; Gen. 22:2; Isa. 42:1  

## Matthew 4

1. Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil.

2. And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards He hungered.

3. And coming near to Him, the Tempter said, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves.

4. But answering, He said, It has been written: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word going out of the mouth of God." Deut. 8:3

5. Then the Devil takes Him to the holy city, and he set Him on the wing of the temple.

6. And he said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it has been written: "He shall give His angels charge concerning You, and they shall bear You on their hands, lest You strike Your foot against a stone." LXX-Psa. 90:11, 12; MT-Psa. 91:11, 12

7. Jesus said to him, Again it has been written: "You shall not tempt the Lord your God." Deut. 6:16

8. Again the Devil takes Him to a very high mountain, and he showed to Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

9. And he said to Him. I will give all these things to You if falling down, You will worship me.

10. Then Jesus said to him, Go, Satan! For it has been written: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve Him only." Deut. 6:13

11. Then the Devil left Him. And behold! Angels came near and ministered to Him.   

12. But Jesus hearing that John was delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.

13. And leaving Nazareth, coming He lived at Capernaum, beside the sea in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali,

14. so that might be fulfilled that spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:

15. "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations:

16. the people sitting in the darkness saw a great Light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, Light sprang up to them." Isa. 9:1, 2

17. From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent! For the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.   

18. And walking beside the sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.

19. And He says to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And leaving the nets, they immediately followed Him.

21. And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And He called them.

22. And at once leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.   

23. And Jesus went around all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every one of the illnesses among the people.

24. And the report of Him went out into all Syria. And they brought to Him all the ones having illness, suffering various diseases and torments, also those having been demon-possessed, and those having been moonstruck, and paralytics; and He healed them.

25. And many crowds followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.  

## Matthew 5

1. But seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain, and seating Himself, His disciples came near to Him.

2. And opening His mouth, He taught them, saying:   

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of the Heavens.

4. Blessed are they who mourn! For they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meek! For they shall inherit the earth. Psa. 37:11

6. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness! For they shall be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful! For they shall obtain mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart! For they shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers! For they shall be called sons of God.

10. Blessed are they who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake! For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.

11. Blessed are you when they shall reproach you, and persecute you , and shall say every evil word against you, lying, on account of Me.

12. Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in Heaven; for in this way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.   

13. You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what shall it be salted? For it has strength for nothing any more but to be thrown out and to be trampled under by men.

14. You are the light of the world. A city situated on a mountain cannot be hidden.

15. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under the grain measure, but on the lampstand; and it shines for all who are in the house.

16. So let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father in Heaven.   

17. Do not think that I came to annul the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to annul, but to fulfill.

18. Truly I say to you, Until the heaven and the earth pass away, in no way shall one iota or one tittle pass away from the law until all comes to pass.

19. Therefore, whoever relaxes one of these commandments, the least, and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of Heaven. But whoever does and teaches them , this one shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.

20. For I say to you, If your righteousness shall not exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, in no way shall you go into the kingdom of Heaven.   

21. You have heard that it was said to the ancients: "Do not commit murder!" And, Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the Judgment. Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17

22. But I say to you, Everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be liable to the Judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the sanhedrin; but whoever says, Fool! shall be liable to be thrown into the fire of Hell.

23. Therefore, if you offer your gift on the altar, and remember there that your brother has something against you,

24. leave your gift there before the altar, and go. First, be reconciled to your brother, and then coming, offer your gift.

25. Be well intentioned toward your opponent quickly, while you are in the way with him, that the opponent not deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.

26. Truly, I say to you, In no way shall you come out from there until you pay the last kodrantes.   

27. You have heard that it was said to the ancients: "Do not commit adultery." Ex. 20:14; Deut. 5:18

28. But I say to you, Everyone looking at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. But if your right eye offends you, take it out and throw it from you, for it is profitable to you that one of your members should perish and all your body not be thrown into Hell.

30. And if your right hand causes you to offend, cut it off and throw it from you, for it is profitable to you that one of your members should perish and all your body not be thrown into Hell.

31. It was also said, Whoever puts away his wife, "let him give her a bill of divorce." Deut. 24:1

32. But I say to you, Whoever puts away his wife, apart from a matter of fornication, causes her to commit adultery. And who ever shall marry the one put away commits adultery.   

33. Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: "You shall not swear falsely, but shall give your oaths to the Lord." Lev. 19:12; Num. 30:2

34. But I say to you, Do not swear at all, neither by Heaven, because it is God's throne; Isa. 66:1

35. nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King. Isa. 66:1; Psa. 48:2

36. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.

37. But let your word be Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these is from evil.   

38. You have heard that it was said: "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;" Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21

39. but I say to you, Do not resist the evil; but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also.

40. And to him desiring to sue you, and to take your tunic, allow him also to have the coat.

41. And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go two with him.

42. He asking you to give, and he wishing to borrow from you, do not turn away.   

43. You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor" and hate your enemy; Lev. 19:18

44. but I say to you, Love your enemies; bless those cursing you, do well to those hating you; and pray for those abusing and persecuting you,

45. so that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven. Because He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and unjust.

46. For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same?

47. And if you only greet your brothers, what exceptional thing do you do? Do not the tax-collectors do so?

48. Therefore, you be perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.  

## Matthew 6

1. Be careful not to do your merciful deeds before men in order to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have no reward from your Father in Heaven.

2. Therefore, when you do merciful deeds, do not trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.

3. But you doing merciful deeds, do not let your left know what your right hand does,

4. so that your merciful deeds may be in secret. And your Father seeing in secret Himself will repay you in the open.   

5. And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the open streets so that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.

6. But you, when you pray, enter into your room and shutting your door, pray to your Father in secret. And your Father seeing in secret will repay you in the open.

7. But when you pray, do not babble vain words, as the nations; for they think that they shall be heard in their much speaking.

8. Then do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him.   

9. So, then, you should pray this way: Our Father who is in Heaven, let be sanctified Your name.

10. Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, as it is in Heaven, also on the earth.

11. Give us today our daily bread,

12. and forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.

13. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil, for Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory to the ages. Amen.

14. For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

15. But if you will not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.   

16. And when you fast, do not be as the hypocrites, darkening the face, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you that they have their reward.

17. But you in fasting, anoint your head and wash your face,

18. so as not to appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father in secret. And your Father seeing in secret will repay you in the open.   

19. Do not treasure up for you treasures on the earth, where moth and rust cause to vanish, and where thieves dig through and steal.

20. But treasure up for you treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust cause to vanish, and where thieves do not dig through and steal.

21. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

22. The lamp of the body is the eye. Then if your eye is sound, all your body is light.

23. But if your eye is evil, all your body is dark. If, then, the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!

24. No one is able to serve two lords; for either he will hate the one, and he will love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and he will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and wealth.   

25. Because of this, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your soul, what you eat and what you drink, nor for your body, what you put on. Is not the soul more than the food and the body than the clothing?

26. Observe the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor do they reap, nor do they gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Do you not rather excel them?

27. But who of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit onto his stature?

28. And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not labor nor do they spin,

29. but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these.

30. If God so enrobes the grass of the field (which is today, and is thrown into a furnace tomorrow) will He not much rather you, little-faiths?

31. Then do not be anxious, saying, What may we eat? Or, what may we drink? Or, what may clothe us?

32. For after all these things the nations seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.

33. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

34. Then do not be anxious for tomorrow. For the morrow will be anxious of itself. Sufficient to each day is its own trouble.  

## Matthew 7

1. Do not judge, that you may not be judged;

2. for with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured again to you.

3. But why do you look on the twig that is in the eye of your brother, but do not see the log in your eye?

4. Or how will you say to your brother, Allow me to cast out the twig from your eye; and behold, the log is in your eye!

5. Hypocrite, first cast the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to cast the twig out of the eye of your brother.

6. Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor throw your pearls before the pigs, that they should not trample them with their feet, and turning they may tear you.   

7. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

8. For each one that asks receives, and the one that seeks finds; and to the one knocking, it will be opened.

9. Or what man of you is there, if his son should ask a loaf of him, will he give him a stone?

10. And if he should ask a fish, will he give him a snake?

11. Therefore, if you, being evil. know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those that ask Him?   

12. Therefore, all things, whatever you desire that men should do to you, so also you should do to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.

13. Go in through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are the ones who go through it.

14. For narrow is the gate, and constricted is the way that leads away into life, and few are the ones who find it.   

15. But beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inside they are plundering wolves.

16. From their fruits you shall know them. Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?

17. So every good tree produces good fruits, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruits.

18. A good tree cannot produce evil fruits, nor a corrupt tree produce good fruits.

19. Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and is thrown into fire.

20. Then surely from their fruits you shall know them.   

21. Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of Heaven, but the ones who do the will of My Father in Heaven.

22. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?

23. And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; "depart from Me, those working lawlessness!" Psa. 6:8

24. Then everyone who hears these words from Me, and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house on the rock;

25. and the rains came down, and the rivers came up, and the winds blew, and fell against that house; but it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.

26. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and who does not do them, he shall be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand;

27. and the rain came down, and the rivers came up, and the winds blew and beat against that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

28. And it happened, when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at His doctrine.

29. For He was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.  

## Matthew 8

1. And He having come down from the mount, great crowds followed Him.

2. And behold, coming up, a leper worshiped Him, saying, Lord, If You will, You are able to cleanse me.

3. And stretching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will! Be cleansed! And instantly his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.   

5. And Jesus, entering into Capernaum, a centurion came near to Him, begging Him,

6. and saying, Lord, my boy has been laid in the house, a paralytic, being grievously tormented.

7. And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.

8. And answering, the centurion said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof, but only speak a word and my boy will be healed.

9. For I am also a man under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to this one, Go; and he goes; and to another, Come; and he comes; and to my slave, Do this; and he does it .

10. And hearing, Jesus marveled, and said to those following, Truly I say to you, Not even in Israel did I find such faith.

11. But I say to you that many will come from east and west, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven,

12. but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go, and as you have believed, so let it be to you. And his boy was healed in that hour.   

14. And coming to the house of Peter, Jesus saw his mother-in-law laid out and in a fever.

15. And He touched her hand, and her fever left her. And she rose up and served them.

16. And evening having come on, they brought to Him many having been possessed by demons. And He cast out the spirits by a word, and He healed all those having illness,

17. so that it might be fulfilled that spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "He took upon Himself our weaknesses, and bore our sicknesses." Isa. 53:4   

18. And seeing great crowds around Him, Jesus gave orders to go away to the other side.

19. And one, a scribe, coming near, said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever you may go.

20. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere He may lay His head.

21. And another of His disciples said to Him, Lord, allow me first to go away and bury my father.

22. But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead.   

23. And He entering into the boat, His disciples followed Him.

24. And, behold, a great storm rose up in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was sleeping.

25. And coming near, His disciples awakened Him, saying, Lord, save us! We are perishing.

26. And He said to them, Why are you afraid, little-faiths? Then rising up, He rebuked the winds and the sea. And there was a great calm.

27. And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?   

28. And when He had come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two demon-possessed ones met Him, coming out of the tombs, very violent, so that no one was able to pass through that way.

29. And, behold! They cried out, saying, What is to us and to You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here beforetime to torment us?

30. And far off from them there was a herd of many pigs feeding.

31. And the demons begged Him, saying, If You cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of pigs.

32. And He said to them, Go! And coming out, these went away into the herd of pigs. And, behold, all the herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the waters.

33. But those who fed them fled, and going into the city, they told all the things of the ones who had been demon-possessed.

34. And, behold, all the city went out to meet with Jesus. And seeing Him, they begged that He move away from their borders.  

## Matthew 9

1. And entering into the boat, He passed over and came to His own city.

2. And, behold! They were bringing a paralytic lying on a cot to Him. And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, Be comforted, child. Your sins have been forgiven you.

3. And, behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This one blasphemes.

4. And seeing their thoughts, Jesus said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?

5. For what is easier, to say, Your sins have been forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?

6. But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, then He said to the paralytic, Rising up, lift up your cot and go to your house.

7. And rising up, he went away to his house.

8. And seeing, the crowds marveled, and they glorified God who gave such authority to men.   

9. And passing from there, Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. And rising up, he followed Him.

10. And it happened as He reclined in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners having come, these were reclining with Jesus and His disciples.

11. And seeing, the Pharisees said to His disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?

12. But Jesus hearing, He said to them, The ones who are strong have no need of a physician, but the ones who are sick.

13. But going, learn what this is , "I desire mercy and not sacrifice." For I did not come to call righteous ones , but sinners to repentance. Hos. 6:6   

14. Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, and Your disciples do not fast?

15. And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will have been taken from them, and then they will fast.

16. But no one puts a piece of new cloth onto an old garment. For its filling up takes away from the garment, and a worse tear takes its place.

17. Nor do they put new wine into old skins; otherwise, the skins are burst, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be ruined. But they put new wine into fresh skins, and both are preserved together.   

18. As He spoke these things to them, behold, coming up a ruler bowed before Him, saying, My daughter has just now died; but coming lay Your hand on her, and she will live.

19. And rising up, Jesus and His disciples followed him.

20. And behold, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came near behind Him, and touched the fringe of His robe.

21. For she said within herself, If only I shall touch His robe, I will be cured.

22. But turning and seeing her, Jesus said, Be comforted, daughter; your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour.

23. And coming into the house of the ruler, and seeing the flute-players and the crowd causing a tumult,

24. Jesus said to them, Go back, for the little girl has not died, but she sleeps. And they laughed at Him.

25. But when the crowd had been put out, entering He took hold of her hand, and the little girl rose up.

26. And this report went out into all that land.   

27. And Jesus passing on from there, two blind ones followed Him, crying and saying, Have pity on us, Son of David.

28. And coming into the house, the blind ones came near to Him. And Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? And they said to Him, Yes, Lord.

29. Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be to you.

30. And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly ordered them, saying, See, let no one know.

31. But going out, they made Him known in all that land.

32. And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man who had been possessed by a demon.

33. And the demon being cast out, the dumb one spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, Never was it seen this way in Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said, He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.   

35. And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every weakness of body among the people.

36. And seeing the crowds, He was moved with pity for them, because they were tired and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.

37. Then He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is great, but the workers few.

38. Pray then that the Lord of the harvest may send out workers into His harvest.  

## Matthew 10

1. And having called His twelve disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, so as to throw them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness of body.

2. And the names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon who is called Peter and his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John,

3. Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax-collector, James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbaeus, whose last name was Thaddaeus,

4. Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.   

5. Jesus sent these twelve out, charging them, saying: Do not go into the way of the nations, and do not go into a Samaritan city.

6. But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And going on, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.

8. Heal sick ones, cleanse lepers, raise dead ones, cast out demons. You have freely received, freely give.

9. Do not provide gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,

10. nor provision bag for the road, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staves. For the worker is worthy of his food.

11. And into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is worthy; and remain there until you go out.

12. But entering into the house, greet it;

13. and if the house truly is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

14. And whoever will not receive you, nor will hear your words, having gone out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

15. Truly I say to you, It will be more bearable to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in Judgment Day than for that city.   

16. Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore, be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

17. But beware of men. For they will betray you to sanhedrins, and they will flog you in their synagogues.

18. And also you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.

19. But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you should say, for it is given to you in that hour what you should say.

20. For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

21. But brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child. And children will rise up against parents and will put them to death.

22. And you will be hated by all on account of My name, but the one enduring to the end shall be kept safe.

23. But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly I say to you, In no way will you have finished the cities of Israel until the Son of man comes.

24. A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his lord.

25.  It is enough for the disciple to become as his teacher, and the slave as his lord. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?

26. Therefore, you should not fear them, for nothing is covered which will not be uncovered; and hidden, which will not be made known.

27. What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light. And what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.

28. And you should not fear the ones killing the body, but not being able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him being able to destroy both soul and body in Hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? Yet not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father.

30. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Then do not fear; you are better than many sparrows.

32. Then everyone who shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in Heaven.

33. But whoever denies Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father in Heaven.

34. Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

35. I came to dissever a man from his father, and a daughter from her mother, and a bride from her mother-in-law.

36. "And a man's enemies shall be those of his own house." Mic. 7:6

37. He that loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he that loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.

38. And whoever does not take up his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.

39. The one finding his life shall lose it. And the one losing his life on account of Me shall find it.

40. The one receiving you receives Me, and the one receiving Me receives Him who sent Me.

41. The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one receiving a just one in the name of a just one will receive a just one's reward.

42. And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to drink to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, In no way will he lose his reward.  

## Matthew 11

1. And it happened when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples, He left there to teach and to proclaim in their cities.

2. But hearing in the prison of the works of Christ, sending two of his disciples,

3. John said to Him, Are You the One coming, or are we to look for another?

4. And answering, Jesus said to them, Going, relate to John what you hear and see:

5. The blind receive sight, and the lame walk; lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, and the poor are given the gospel. Isa. 61:1

6. And blessed is the one , whoever shall not be offended in Me.   

7. But as these were going, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being shaken with the wind?

8. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing ? Behold, those wearing soft things are in the houses of kings.

9. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one more excellent than a prophet.

10. For this is the one about whom it has been written: "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You." Mal. 3:1

11. Truly I say to you, Not has arisen among those born of a woman any greater than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is.

12. But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent seize it.

13. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

14. And if you are willing to receive, he is Elijah, the one about to come.

15. The one having ears to hear, let him hear.   

16. But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the markets, and calling to their mates,

17. and saying, We piped to you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not wail.

18. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.

19. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, and a friend of tax collectors, and of sinners. And wisdom was justified by her children.

20. Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His powerful acts had occurred, for they did not repent.

21. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the powerful acts which have taken place in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. But I say to you, It shall be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in Judgment Day than for you.

23. And you, Capernaum, who "have been exalted to the heaven, you will be thrown down to Hades." For if the powerful acts happening in you had taken place in Sodom, it would remain until today. Isa. 14:13, 15

24. But I say to you, It will be more bearable for the land of Sodom in Judgment day than for you.   

25. Answering at that time, Jesus said, I praise You, Father, Lord of Heaven and of Earth, because You hid these things from the sophisticated and cunning and revealed them to babes.

26. Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing before You.

27. All things were yielded up to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him .

28. Come to Me, all those laboring and being burdened, and I will give you rest.

29. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, because I am meek and lowly in heart, "and you will find rest to your souls." Jer. 6:16

30. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.  

## Matthew 12

1. At that time on the sabbath, Jesus went through the grain fields. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.

2. But seeing, the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.

3. But He said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he and those with him hungered?

4. How he entered into the house of God, and he ate the Bread of Arrangement, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?

5. Or have you not read in the Law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are guiltless?

6. But I say to you, One greater than the temple is here.

7. But if you had known what this is, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice," you would not have condemned the guiltless. Hos. 6:6

8. For the Son of man is also Lord of the sabbath.

9. And moving from there, He came into their synagogue.

10. And, behold, a man having a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbaths? (that they might accuse Him).

11. But He said to them, What man of you will be who will have one sheep, and if this one fall into a pit on the sabbaths, will he not lay hold of it and raise it up?

12. How much more, then, does a man excel a sheep! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbaths.

13. Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he stretched out. And it was restored sound as the other.   

14. But as they were leaving, the Pharisees took up a council against Him, how they might destroy Him.

15. But knowing, Jesus withdrew from there. And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them all

16. and warned them that they should not make Him manifest.

17. So that might be fulfilled that spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

18. "Behold My Child whom I chose, My Beloved, in whom My soul has delighted! I will put My Spirit on Him, and He will declare judgment to the nations.

19. He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

20. A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench, until He bring forth judgment to victory." Isa. 42:1 -3

21. "And the nations will hope in His name." LXX-Isa. 42:4   

22. Then one having been demon-possessed was brought to Him, blind and dumb. And He healed him, so that the blind and dumb one could both speak and see.

23. And all the crowds were amazed, and said, Is this not the son of David?

24. But hearing, the Pharisees said, This one does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons.

25. But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to ruin. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

26. And if Satan throws out Satan, he was divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?

27. And if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Because of this, they shall be your judges.

28. But if I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come on you.

29. Or how is anyone able to enter the house of the strong one and plunder his goods, if he does not first tie up the strong one; and then he will plunder his house?

30. The one who is not with Me is against Me, and the one who does not gather with Me scatters.

31. Because of this, I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy concerning the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.

32. And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, not in this age nor in the coming one .

33. Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by the fruit.

34. Offspring of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. The good man out of the good treasure of the heart puts forth good things. And the evil man out of the evil treasure puts forth evil things.

36. But I say to you, that every idle word, whatever men may speak, they shall give an account of it in Judgment Day.

37. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.   

38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we desire to see a sign from you.

39. But answering, He said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

40. And even as "Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights," so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. Jon. 1:17

41. Men, Ninevites, will stand up in the Judgment with this generation and will condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and, behold, a Greater-than-Jonah is here.

42.  The queen of the south will be raised in the Judgment with this generation and will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and, behold, a Greater-than-Solomon is here.

43. But when the unclean spirit goes from a man, he goes through dry places seeking rest and does not find it .

44. Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came out. And coming, he finds it standing empty, swept and decorated.

45. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and entering dwells there. And the last things of that man become worse than the first. So it will be also to this evil generation.   

46. But while He was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.

47. Then one said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You.

48. But answering, He said to the one speaking to Him, Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?

49. And stretching out His hand to His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers.

50. For whoever shall do the will of My Father in Heaven, that one is My brother and sister and mother.  

## Matthew 13

1. And going out from the house in that day, Jesus sat down by the sea.

2. And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that boarding the boat, He sat down. And all the crowd stood on the shore.

3. And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went out to sow.

4. And in his sowing, some fell by the roadside, and the birds came and ate them.

5.  And other fell on the stony places where they did not have much earth, and it immediately sprang up because it had no deepness of earth.

6. And the sun rising, it was scorched; and because of having no root, it was dried up.

7. And other fell on the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.

8. And other fell on the good ground and yielded fruit; indeed, one a hundredfold, and one sixty, and one thirty.

9. The one having ears to hear, let him hear.

10. And coming near, the disciples said to Him, Why do You speak to them in parables?

11. And answering, He said to them, Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but it has not been given to those.

12. For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have overabundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.

13. Because of this, I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

14. And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled on them, which says, "In hearing you will hear and in no way understand, and seeing you will see yet in no way perceive.

15. For the heart of this people has grown fat, and they heard sluggishly with the ears, and they have closed their eyes, that they not see with the eyes, or hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I heal them." LXX-Isa. 6:9, 10

16. But your eyes are blessed because they see; and your ears because they hear.

17. For truly I tell you that many prophets and righteous ones desired to see what you see and did not see, and to hear what you hear and did not hear.

18. Then hear the parable of the sower:

19. Everyone hearing the Word of the kingdom, and not understanding, then the evil one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is that sown by the roadside.

20. And that sown on the stony places is this: the one hearing the Word, and immediately receiving it with joy,

21. but has no root in himself, but is temporary, and tribulation, or persecution occurring because of the Word, he is at once offended.

22. And that sown into the thorns is this: the one hearing the Word, and the anxiety of this age, and the deceit of riches, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.

23. But that sown on the good ground is this: the one hearing the Word, and understanding it, who indeed brings forth and produces fruit: one truly a hundredfold, and one sixty, and one thirty.   

24. He put before them another parable, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is compared to a man sowing good seed in his fields.

25. But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat, and went away.

26. And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the darnel also appeared.

27. And coming near, the slaves of the housemaster said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then from where does it have the darnel?

28. And he said to them, A man, an enemy did this. And the slaves said to him, Do you desire, then, that going out we should gather them?

29. But he said, No, lest gathering the darnel you should uproot the wheat with them.

30. Allow both to grow together until the harvest. And in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather the darnel, and bind them into bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my granary.

31. He put another parable before them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is compared to a grain of mustard, which taking, a man sowed in his field;

32. which indeed is less than all the seeds, but when it is grown it is greater than the plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and roost in its branches.

33. He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of Heaven is compared to leaven, which taking, a woman hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.

34. Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and He did not speak to them without a parable,

35. so that was fulfilled that spoken through the prophet, saying: "I will open My mouth in parables; I will say things hidden from the foundation of the world." Psa. 78:2

36. Then sending away the crowds, Jesus came into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.

37. And answering, He said to them, The one sowing the good seed is the Son of man.

38. And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; but the darnel are the sons of the evil one .

39. And the enemy who sowed them is the Devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the angels are the reapers.

40. Then as the darnel is gathered and is consumed in the fire, so it will be in the end of this age.

41. The Son of man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all the offenses, and those who practice lawlessness.

42. And they will throw them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

43. Then the righteous will shine out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one having ears to hear, let him hear.   

44. Again, the kingdom of Heaven is compared to treasure hidden in the field, which finding, a man hid; and for the joy of it, he goes and sells all things, as many as he has, and buys that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of Heaven is compared to a man, a merchant seeking excellent pearls;

46. who finding one very precious pearl, going away has sold all things, as many as he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of Heaven is compared to a drag net thrown into the sea, and gathering together of every kind;

48. which, when it was filled, drawing it up on the shore, and sitting down, they gathered the good into containers, and they threw out the rotten.

49. So it will be in the end of the age: the angels will go out and will separate the wicked from the midst of the righteous,

50. and will throw them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

51. Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.

52. And He said to them, Because of this, every scribe schooled to the kingdom of Heaven is like a man, a master of a house, who puts forth out of his treasure new and old.   

53. And it happened, when Jesus had finished these parables, He moved from there.

54. And coming into His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Where did this one get this wisdom, and the powerful works?

55. Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

56. And are not his sisters all with us? From where then did this one get all these things?

57. And they were offended in Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own homeland, and in his own house.

58. And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.  

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus.

2. And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and because of this, powerful works are working in him.

3. For seizing John, Herod bound him and put him into prison, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.

4. For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.

5. And desiring to kill him, he feared the multitude, because they held him as a prophet.

6. But a birthday feast for Herod being held, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased Herod.

7. So then he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.

8. But she being urged on by her mother, she says, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.

9. And the king was grieved, but because of the oaths, and those who had reclined with him , he ordered it to be given.

10. And sending, he beheaded John in the prison.

11. And his head was brought on a platter and was given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.

12. And having come, his disciples took the body and buried it; and coming, they reported to Jesus.   

13. And having heard, Jesus withdrew privately from there in a boat, into a deserted place. And hearing, the crowds followed Him on foot out of the cities.

14. And going out, Jesus saw a great crowd and was filled with pity toward them. And He healed their infirm ones.

15. And evening coming, His disciples came near to Him saying, The place is deserted, and the hour is already gone by. Dismiss the crowds, that going away into the villages they may buy provisions for themselves.

16. But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go away. You give them food to eat.

17. But they said to Him, We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.

18. And He said, Bring them here to Me.

19. And commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, and taking the five loaves and two fish, looking up to Heaven, He blessed. And breaking, He gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the crowds.

20. And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the left over pieces, twelve hand baskets full.

21. And the ones eating were about five thousand men, besides women and children.   

22. And immediately Jesus made His disciples get into a boat and to go before Him to the other side until He should dismiss the crowds.

23. And having dismissed the crowds, He went up into the mountain alone to pray. And evening coming on, He was there alone.

24. But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.

25. But in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.

26. And seeing Him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying, It is a ghost! And they cried out from the fear.

27. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be comforted! I AM! Do not fear.

28. And answering, Him, Peter said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the waters.

29. And He said, Come! And going down from the boat, Peter walked on the waters to go to Jesus.

30. But seeing the strong wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!

31. And immediately stretching out the hand, Jesus took hold of him, and said to him, Little-faith, why did you doubt?

32. And coming into the boat, the wind ceased.

33. And those in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, Truly, You are the Son of God.   

34. And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.

35. And recognizing Him, the men of that place sent to all that neighborhood, and brought to Him all those who had illness.

36. And they begged Him that they might touch the fringe of His robe. And as many as touched were made perfectly well.  

## Matthew 15

1. Then the scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,

2. Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.

3. But answering He said to them, Why do you also transgress the command of God on account of your tradition?

4. For God commanded, saying, "Honor your father and mother," Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16 and, "The one speaking evil of father or mother, by death let him die." Ex. 21:17

5. But you say, Whoever says to the father or the mother, A gift, whatever you would gain from me;

6. and in no way he honors his father or his mother. And you annulled the command of God on account of your tradition.

7. Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying:

8. "This people draws near to Me with their mouth, and with their lips honor Me; but their heart is far from Me.

9. But in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the ordinances of men." Isa. 29:13   

10. And calling near the crowd, He said to them, Hear and understand:

11.  It is not that which has entered into the mouth that defiles the man, but that which has come out of the mouth, this defiles the man.

12. Then coming, the disciples said to Him, You know that hearing the saying, the Pharisees were offended?

13. But answering, He said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.

14. Leave them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.

15. And answering, Peter said to Him, Explain this parable to us.

16. But Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?

17. Do you not yet perceive that everything entering into the mouth goes into the belly, and is thrown out into the waste bowl?

18. But the things which come out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and these defile the man.

19. For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, lies, blasphemies.

20. These things are the things defiling the man. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.   

21. And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And, behold, a woman of Canaan coming forth from those borders cried out to Him, saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is vilely demon-possessed.

23. But He did not answer her a word. And coming near, His disciples asked Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries out after us.

24. But answering, He said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. But coming, she worshiped Him, saying, Lord, help me!

26. But answering, He said, It is not good to take the bread of the children to throw it to the little dogs.

27. But she said, Yes, Lord; for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their lords.

28. Then answering, Jesus said to her, O woman, your faith is great; let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour.   

29. And moving from there, Jesus came beside the Sea of Galilee. And going up into the mountain, He sat there.

30. And great crowds came to Him, having with them lame ones, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others. And they flung them down at the feet of Jesus. And He healed them;

31. so that the crowds marveled, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

32. But having called near His disciples, Jesus said, I am filled with pity on the crowd, because they already have remained with Me three days and have nothing they may eat. And I do not desire to send them away fasting, that they may not faint in the way.

33. And His disciples said to Him, From where in a deserted place will come to us so many loaves as to satisfy so great a crowd?

34. And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.

35. And He ordered the crowds to recline on the ground.

36. And taking the seven loaves and the fish, giving thanks, He broke and gave to His disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.

37. And all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the left over pieces, seven lunch baskets full.

38. And the ones eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And sending away the crowds He went into the boat and came to the borders of Magdala.  

## Matthew 16

1. And coming, the Pharisees and Sadducees asked Him to show them a sign out of the heaven, tempting Him.

2. But answering, He said to them, Evening coming on, you say, Clear sky, for the sky is red.

3. And at morning, Today a storm, for the sky is red, being overcast. Hypocrites! You indeed know how to discern the face of the heaven, but you cannot the signs of the times.

4. An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. And leaving them, He went away.   

5. And His disciples coming to the other side, they forgot to take loaves.

6. And Jesus said to them, Watch! And beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we did not take loaves.

8. And knowing, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason among yourselves because you took no loaves, little-faiths?

9. Do you not perceive nor recall the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many hand baskets you took up?

10. Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many lunch baskets you took up?

11. How do you not perceive that it was not about loaves that I said to you to beware of from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?

12. Then they knew that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but from the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.   

13. And coming into the parts of Caesarea of Philip, Jesus questioned His disciples, saying, Whom do men say Me the Son of Man to be?

14. And they said, Some say John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. He said to them, But you, whom do you say Me to be?

16. And answering, Simon Peter said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

17. And answering, Jesus said to him, Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.

18. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against her.

19. And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven. And whatever you bind on earth shall occur, having been bound in Heaven. And whatever you may loose on the earth shall be, having been loosed in Heaven.

20. Then He warned His disciples that they should tell no one that He is Jesus the Christ.   

21. From that time, Jesus began to show to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.

22. And having taken Him near, Peter began to rebuke Him, saying, God be gracious to You, Lord; this shall never be to You.

23. But turning He said to Peter, Go behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you do not think of the things of God, but the things of men.   

24. Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and let him bear his cross, and let him follow Me.

25. For whoever may desire to save his life will lose it. But whoever may lose his life for My sake will find it.

26. For what will a man be benefited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give as an exchange for his soul?

27. For the Son of man is about to come with His angels in the glory of His Father. And then "He will give reward to each according to his actions." LXX-Psa. 61:13; Pro. 24:12; MT-Psa. 62:12

28. Truly I say to you, There are some standing here who in no way will taste of death until they see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.  

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days, Jesus took Peter and James, and his brother John, and brought them up into a high mountain apart.

2. And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His clothing became white as the light.

3. And, behold! Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.

4. And answering, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You will, let us make three tents here, one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. While he was yet speaking, behold, a radiant cloud overshadowed them. And, behold, a voice out of the cloud saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight; hear Him. Psa. 2:7; Gen. 22:2; Isa. 42:1; Deut. 18:15

6. And hearing, the disciples fell on their face and were greatly terrified.

7. And coming near, Jesus touched them and said, Rise up, and do not be terrified.

8. And lifting up their eyes, they did not see anyone except Jesus alone.

9. And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised from the dead.

10. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

11. And answering, Jesus said to them, Elijah indeed comes first and shall restore all things.

12. But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they desired. So also the Son of man is about to suffer by them.

13. Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist.   

14. And they coming to the crowd, a man came near to Him, kneeling down to Him, and saying,

15. Lord, pity my son. For he is moonstruck and suffers miserably. For he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.

17. And answering, Jesus said, O faithless and perverted generation! How long will I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.

18. And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour.

19. Then coming up to Jesus privately, the disciples said, Why were we not able to cast him out?

20. And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there! And it will move. And nothing shall be impossible to you.

21. But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.   

22. And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.

23. And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they grieved exceedingly.   

24. And they coming into Capernaum, those receiving the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?

25. He said, Yes. And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or tribute? From their sons or from strangers?

26. Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then truly the sons are free.

27. But that we may not offend them, going to the sea, throw in a hook and take the first fish coming up. And opening its mouth, you will find a stater. Taking that, give to them for you and Me.  

## Matthew 18

1. In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of Heaven?

2. And having called forward a little child, Jesus set him in their midst.

3. And He said, Truly I say to you, Unless you convert and become as the little children, not at all can you enter into the kingdom of Heaven.

4. Then whoever will humble himself as this little child, this one is the greater in the kingdom of Heaven.

5. And whoever will receive one such little child in My name receives Me.

6. But whoever causes one of these little ones believing in Me to offend, it is better for him that a millstone turned by an ass be hung on his neck, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.   

7. Woe to the world from its offenses! It is a necessity for the offenses to come, yet woe to that man through whom the offense comes!

8. And if your hand or your foot offends you, cut it off and throw it from you; it is good for you to enter into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be thrown into the everlasting fire.

9. And if your eye offends you, pluck it out and throw it from you; for it is good for you to enter into life one eyed, than having two eyes to be thrown into the Hell of fire.

10. See that you do not despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that their angels in Heaven continually look on the face of My Father in Heaven.

11. For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost.

12. What do you think? If there be to any man a hundred sheep, and one of them strays away, will he not leave the ninety nine on the mountains, and going, seek the straying one ?

13. And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine not going astray.

14. So it is not the will before your Father in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish.   

15. But if your brother sins against you, go and reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.

16. But if he does not hear, take one or two more with you, "so that on the mouth of two" or "three witnesses every word may stand". Deut. 19:15

17. But if he fails to hear them, tell it to the church. And if he also fails to hear the church, let him be to you as the nations and the tax collector.

18. Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall occur, having been bound in Heaven. And whatever you loose on the earth shall be, having been loosed in Heaven.

19. Again I say to you, If two of you agree on earth as to anything, whatever they shall ask, it shall be to them from My Father in Heaven.

20. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.   

21. Then coming up to Him, Peter said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?

22. Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.

23. For this reason the kingdom of Heaven has been compared to a man, a king, who decided to take account with his slaves.

24. And when he began to reckon, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought near to him.

25. But he not having any to pay, the lord commanded him to be sold, also his wife and children, and all things, as much as he had, even to pay back.

26. Then falling down, the slave bowed the knee to him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay all to you.

27. And being filled with pity, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the loan.

28. But going out, that slave found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii. And seizing him, he choked him , saying, Pay me whatever you owe.

29. Then falling down at his feet, his fellow slave begged him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay all to you.

30. But he would not, but going away he threw him into prison until he pay back the amount owing.

31. But his fellow slaves, seeing the things happening, they were greatly grieved. And coming they reported to their lord all the things happening.

32. Then calling him near, his lord said to him, Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt, since you begged me.

33. Ought you not also to favor your fellow slave, as I also favored you?

34. And being angry, his lord delivered him up to the tormentors until he pay back all that debt to him.

35. So also My heavenly Father will do to you unless each of you from your hearts forgive his brother their trespasses.  

## Matthew 19

1. And it happened when Jesus had finished these words, He moved from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.

2. And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.   

3. And the Pharisees came near to Him, tempting Him, and saying to Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every reason?

4. But answering, He said to them, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning "created them male and female"? Gen. 1:27

5. And He said, "For this reason a man shall leave father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." Gen. 2:24

6. So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.

7. They said to Him, Why then did Moses command to "give a bill of divorce," "and to put her away"? Deut. 24:1

8. He said to them, In view of your hardheartedness, Moses allowed you to put away your wives. But from the beginning it was not so.

9. And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, if not for fornication, and shall marry another, that one commits adultery. And the one who marries her who was put away commits adultery.

10. His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.

11. But He said to them, Not all receive this word, but those to whom it is given.

12. For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to receive, let him receive it.   

13. Then little children were brought to Him, that He might lay hands on them and might pray. But the disciples rebuked them.

14. But Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them to come to Me, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.

15. And laying hands on them, He went away from there.   

16. And, behold, coming near, one said to Him, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?

17. And He said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, God! But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. He said to Him, Which? And Jesus said, "You shall not commit murder, nor commit adultery, nor steal, nor bear false witness,

19. honor your father and your mother," and, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Ex. 20:12-16; Lev. 19:18; Deut. 5:16-20

20. The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?

21. Jesus said to him, If you desire to be perfect, go sell your property and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.

22. But hearing the word, being grieved, the young man went away, for he had many possessions.   

23. And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you that a rich man will with great difficulty enter into the kingdom of Heaven.

24. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.

25. And His disciples were exceedingly astonished when they heard this, saying, Who then can be saved?

26. But looking on them , Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

27. Then answering, Peter said to Him, Behold, we left all things and followed You. What then shall be to us?

28. And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, You who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of man sits on the throne of His glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And everyone who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

30. But many first ones shall be last, and last ones first.  

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of Heaven is like a man, a housemaster, who went out when it was early to hire workers into his vineyard.

2. And agreeing with the workers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market.

4. And he said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is just. And they went.

5. Again, going out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did the same.

6. And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day?

7. They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is just.

8. But evening coming, the Lord of the vineyard said to his manager, Call the workers and pay them the wage, beginning from the last to the first.

9. And the ones coming the eleventh hour each received a denarius.

10. And coming, the first supposed that they would receive more. And they also each received a denarius.

11. And receiving it , they murmured against the housemaster,

12. saying, These last have performed one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.

13. But answering, he said to one of them, Friend, I am not unjust to you. Did you not agree to a denarius with me?

14. Take yours and go. But I desire to give to this last as also to you.

15. Or is it not lawful for me to do what I desire with my things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?

16. So the last shall be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen.   

17. And going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside in the way, and said to them,

18. Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to death.

19. And they will deliver Him up to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.   

20. Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came near to Him, along with her sons, worshipping, and asking something from Him.

21. And He said to her, What do you desire? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right, and one on Your left in Your Kingdom.

22. But answering, Jesus said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink, and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized? They said to Him, We are able.

23. And He said to them, Indeed you shall drink My cup, and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized; but to sit off My right and off My left hand is not Mine to give, but to those for whom it was prepared by My Father.

24. And hearing, the ten were indignant about the two brothers.

25. But having called them, Jesus said, You know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.

26. But it will not be so among you. But whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.

27. And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your servant;

28. Even as the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.   

29. And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.

30. And, behold, two blind ones sitting beside the way, hearing that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, Have pity on us, Lord, Son of David!

31. But the crowd rebuked them, that they be quiet. But they cried out the more, saying, Have pity on us, Lord, Son of David!

32. And stopping, Jesus called them, and said, What do you desire that I do to you?

33. They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

34. And moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes. And instantly their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.  

## Matthew 21

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, toward the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,

2. saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her. Loosen them and lead them to Me.

3. And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them. And he will send them at once.

4. But all this happened that might be fulfilled that spoken by the prophet, saying:

5. "Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek and mounted on an ass, even a colt, the son of an ass." Isa. 62:11; Zech. 9:9

6. And the disciples, going and doing as Jesus ordered them,

7. they led the ass and the colt. And they put on them their garments, and set Him on them.

8. And most of the crowd spread their garments on the road. And others were cutting branches from the trees and were spreading them in the road.

9. And the crowd, the ones going before and the ones following, were crying out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! "Blessed is He coming in the name of the Lord"! Hosanna in the highest! Psa. 118:25, 26

10. And as He entered into Jerusalem, all the city was shaken, saying, Who is this?

11. And the crowds said, This is Jesus, the Prophet, the one from Nazareth of Galilee.   

12. And Jesus entered into the temple of God and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple. And He overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling the doves.

13. And He said to them, It has been written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer," but you have "made it a den of robbers." Isa. 56:7; Jer. 7:11

14. And blind and lame ones came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.

15. But the chief priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders which He did, and the children crying out in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were incensed.

16. And they said to Him, Do you hear what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Did you never read, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings You have perfected praise?" LXX-Psa. 8:3; MT-Psa. 8:2

17. And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.   

18. And returning early to the city, He hungered.

19. And seeing one fig tree by the road, He went up to it, and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, Let there be no more fruit from you forever. And the fig tree immediately dried up.

20. And seeing, the disciples marveled, saying, How quickly the fig tree is dried up!

21. And answering, Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do the miracle of the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, Be taken up and thrown into the sea, it will be so.

22. And all things, whatever you may ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.   

23. And He, coming into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came near to Him as He was teaching, saying, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave this authority to you?

24. And answering, Jesus said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. The baptism of John, from where was it? From Heaven, or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?

26. But if we should say, From men, we fear the people. For all hold John to be a prophet.

27. And answering Jesus, they said, We do not know. And He said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.   

28. But what do you think? A man had two children, and coming to the first he said, Child, go today; work in my vineyard.

29. And answering, he said, I will not. But afterward, feeling sorry, he went.

30. And coming to the second, he said the same. And answering, he said, I go , sir; but he did not leave.

31. Which of the two did the will of the father? They said to Him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go before you into the kingdom of God.

32. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax-collectors and the harlots believed him. And seeing, you did not repent afterwards to believe him.   

33. Hear another parable: There was a certain man, a house master, who planted a vineyard and placed a hedge around it; and he dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. And he rented it to vinedressers and left the country. Isa. 5:1, 2

34. And when the season of the fruits came, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to receive his fruits.

35. And the vinedressers, taking his slaves, they beat this one, and they killed one, and they stoned another.

36. Again he sent other slaves, more than the first. And they did the same to them.

37. And at last he sent his son to them, saying, They will have respect for my son.

38. But seeing the son, the vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and get hold of his inheritance.

39. And taking him, they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .

40. Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to these vinedressers?

41. They said to Him, Bad men! He will miserably destroy them, and he will rent out the vineyard to other vinedressers who will give to him the fruits in their seasons.

42. Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the Scriptures, "A Stone which the builders rejected is the One that has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is a wonder in our eyes?" Psa. 118:22, 23

43. Because of this I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you, and it will be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.

44. And he who falls on this Stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.

45. And hearing His parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees knew that He was speaking about them.

46. And seeking to lay hold of Him, they feared the crowds, because they held Him as a prophet.  

## Matthew 22

1. And answering, Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying:

2. The kingdom of Heaven is compared to a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.

3. And he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they did not desire to come.

4. Again, he sent other slaves, saying, Tell the ones invited, Behold, I have prepared my supper; my oxen, and the fatlings are killed, and all things ready; come to the wedding feast.

5. But not caring they went away, one to his own field, and one to his trading.

6. And the rest, seizing his slaves, insulted and killed them .

7. And hearing, the king became angry. And sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burned their city.

8. Then he said to his slaves, Indeed, the wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.

9. Then go onto the exits of the highways and call to the wedding feast as many as you may find.

10. And going out into the highways, those slaves gathered all, as many as they found, both evil and good. And the wedding feast was filled with reclining guests.

11. And the king coming in to look over those reclining, he saw a man there not having been dressed in a wedding garment.

12. And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here, not having a wedding garment? But he was speechless.

13. Then the king said to the servants, Binding his feet and hands, take him away and throw him out into the outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

14. For many are called, but few chosen.   

15. Then going, the Pharisees took counsel so as they might trap Him in words.

16. And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and it does not concern you about anyone, for you do not look to the face of men.

17. Then tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

18. But knowing their wickedness, Jesus said, Why do you test Me, hypocrites?

19. Show Me the tribute coin. And they brought a denarius to Him.

20. And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this?

21. They said to Him, Caesar's. Then He said to them, Then give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God.

22. And hearing, they marveled. And leaving Him, they went away.   

23. On that day, Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him. And they questioned Him,

24. saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any should die not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up seed to his brother. Deut. 25:5

25. And seven brothers were with us. And having married, the first expired, and not having seed left his wife to his brother.

26. In the same way also the second, and the third, until the seven.

27. And last of all, the woman also died.

28. Then in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be wife? For all had her.

29. And answering, Jesus said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as the angels of God in Heaven.

31. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that spoken to you by God, saying:

32. "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" God is not God of the dead, but of the living. Ex. 3:6

33. And hearing, the crowds were astonished at His doctrine.   

34. But hearing that He had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees were gathered together.

35. And one of them, a lawyer, questioned Him , testing Him, and saying,

36. Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?

37. And Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." Deut. 6:5

38. This is the first and great commandment.

39. And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Lev. 19:18

40. On these two commandments all the Law and the Prophets hang.   

41. But the Pharisees having been gathered, Jesus questioned them,

42. saying, What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He? They say to Him, David's.

43. He said to them, Then how does David in Spirit call Him Lord, saying,

44. "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on My right until I place Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet?" LXX-Psa. 109:1; MT-Psa. 110:1

45. Then if David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?

46. And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any more.  

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus spoke to the crowd and to His disciples,

2. saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sat down on Moses' seat.

3. Then all things, whatever they tell you to keep, keep and do. But do not do according to their works, for they say, and do not do.

4. For they bind heavy and hard to bear burdens, and lay them on the shoulders of men, but they do not desire to move them with their finger.

5. And they do all their works to be seen by men. And they make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their robes.

6. And they love the first couch in the suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,

7. and the greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

8. But do not you be called Rabbi, for One is your Leader, the Christ, and you are all brothers.

9. And call no one your father on earth, for One is your Father, the One in Heaven.

10. Nor be called leaders, for One is your Leader, the Christ.

11. But the greater of you shall be your servant.

12. And whoever will exalt himself shall be humbled, and whoever will humble himself shall be exalted.   

13. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of Heaven before men; for you do not enter, nor do you allow those entering to go in.

14. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, and pray at length as a pretext. Because of this you will receive more abundant judgment.

15. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he has become so, you make him twofold more a son of Hell than yourselves.

16. Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the Holy Place, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the Holy Place is a debtor.

17. Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold, or the Holy Place that sanctifies the gold?

18. And you say , Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift on it, he is a debtor.

19. Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?

20. Then the one swearing by the altar swears by it, and by all things on it.

21. And the one swearing by the Holy Place swears by it, and by the One dwelling in it.

22. And the one swearing by Heaven swears by the throne of God, and by the One sitting on it.

23. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and you have left aside the weightier matters of the Law: judgment, and mercy, and faith. It was right to do these, and not to have left those aside.

24. Blind guides, straining out the gnat, but swallowing the camel!

25. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within they are full of robbery and excess.

26. Blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside of them may become clean also.

27. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened graves which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of bones of the dead, and of all uncleanness.

28. So you also indeed outwardly appear righteous to men, but within are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

29. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous.

30. And you say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

31. So you witness to yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.

32. And you fill up the measure of your fathers.

33. Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of Hell?   

34. Because of this, behold, I send to you prophets and wise ones and scribes. And some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and will persecute from city to city;

35. so that should come on you all the righteous blood poured out on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah whom you murdered between the Holy Place and the altar.

36. Truly I say to you, All these things will come on this generation.

37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets and stoning those sent to her. How often I desired to gather your children in the way a bird gathers her chicks under her wings! And you did not desire it.

38. Behold, "your house is left to you desolate." Jer. 22:5

39. For I say to you, In no way shall you see Me from now on, until you say, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord." Psa. 118:26  

## Matthew 24

1. And going out, Jesus left the temple. And His disciples came to show Him the buildings of the temple.

2. But Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There will not at all be left one stone on a stone which in no way will not be thrown down.

3. And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And, What is the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?   

4. And answering, Jesus said to them, See that not any leads you astray.

5. For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ. And they will cause many to be led astray.

6. But you are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See, do not be terrified. For all things must take place, but the end is not yet.

7. For nation will be raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes against many places.

8. But all these are a beginning of throes.

9. Then they will deliver you up to affliction, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake.

10. And then many will be offended, and they will deliver up one another and will hate one another.

11. And many false prophets will be raised and will cause many to err.

12. And because lawlessness shall have been multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold.

13. But the one who endures to the end, that one will be kept safe.

14. And this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then will come the end.

15. Then when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (the one reading, let him understand), Dan. 11:31; 12:11

16. then let those in Judea flee on the mountains;

17. the one on the housetop, let him not come down to take anything out of his house;

18. and the one in the field, let him not turn back to take his garment.

19. But woe to the woman having a child in womb, and to those suckling in those days!

20. And pray that your flight will not be in winter nor on a sabbath.

21. For there will be great affliction, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.

22. And except those days were shortened, not any flesh would be saved. But on account of the elect, those days will be shortened.

23. Then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! Or, Here! Do not believe.

24. For false christs and false prophets will rise up. And they will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.

25. Behold, I tell you beforehand.

26. Then if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness; do not go out. Behold, He is in the inner rooms; do not believe.

27. For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines as far as the west, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.

28. For wherever the dead body may be, there the eagles will be gathered.

29. And immediately after the affliction of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

30. And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in the heavens. And then all the tribes of the land will wail. And they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and much glory. Dan. 7:13

31. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to their ends.   

32. But learn the parable of the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and it puts out leaves, you know that the summer is near;

33. so also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near at the doors.

34. Truly I say to you, In no way will this generation pass away until all these things have occurred.

35. The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words will never ever pass away.

36. But as to that day and that hour, no one knows, neither the angels of Heaven, except My Father only.

37. But as the days of Noah, so also will be the coming of the Son of man.

38. For as they were in the days before the flood: eating, and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah went into the ark.

39. And they did not know until the flood came and took all away. So also will be the coming of the Son of man.

40. At that time two will be out in the field; the one is taken away, and the one is left;

41. two grinding at the mill; one is taken away, and one is left.

42. Watch, then, for you do not know in what hour your Lord comes.

43. But know this, that if the housemaster had known in what watch the thief comes, he would have watched and not have allowed his house to be dug through.

44. Because of this, you also be ready, for in that hour you think not, the Son of man comes.

45. Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his lord has set over his household, to give to them the food in season?

46. Blessed is that servant whom his lord shall find so doing when he comes.

47. Truly I say to you, He will set him over all his substance.

48. But if that wicked servant says in his heart, My lord delays to come,

49. and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and to drink with the ones drinking,

50. the lord of that slave will come in a day in which he does not expect and in an hour which he does not know,

51. and will cut him in two, and will appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.  

## Matthew 25

1. Then the kingdom of Heaven shall be compared to ten virgins who taking their lamps, went out to a meeting of the bridegroom.

2. And five of them were wise, and five foolish.

3. Those being foolish, taking their lamps, did not take oil with them.

4. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

5. But the bridegroom delaying, all nodded and slept.

6. And at midnight, a cry occurred: Behold, the bridegroom comes! Go out to meet him.

7. Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lamps.

8. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.

9. But the wise answered, saying, No , lest there not be enough for us and you. But rather, go to those who sell and buy for yourselves.

10. But they going away to buy, the bridegroom came. And those ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.

11. And afterwards, the rest of the virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

12. But answering, he said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.

13. Therefore, watch, for you do not know the day nor the hour in which the Son of man comes.   

14. For it is as if a man going abroad called his own slaves and delivered his goods to them.

15. And to one indeed he gave five talents, and to another, two, and to another, one, to each according to his ability. And he went abroad at once.

16. And going, the one who received the five talents worked with them and made another five talents.

17. In the same way, the one with the two also did ; he also gained another two.

18. But going away, the one who received the one dug in the earth and hid his lord's silver.

19. And after much time, the lord of those slaves came and took account with them.

20. And coming up, the one who received five talents brought another five talents near, saying, Lord, you delivered five talents to me. Behold, I gained another five talents above them.

21. And his lord said to him, Well done , good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.

22. And the one who received two talents also coming up, he said, Lord, you delivered two talents to me. Behold, I have gained two other talents above them.

23. His lord said to him, Well done , good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.

24. And the one who received the one talent also coming up, he said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter;

25. and being afraid, going away, I hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have yours.

26. And answering, his lord said to him, Evil and slothful slave! You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not I scatter.

27. Then you ought to have put my silver to the bankers, and coming I would have received my own with interest.

28. Therefore, take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.

29. For to each who has, more will be given, and he will abound. But from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken from him.

30. And throw the worthless slave out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.   

31. But when the Son of man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.

32. And before Him shall be gathered all the nations; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

33. And indeed He will set the sheep off His right, but the goats off the left hand .

34. Then the King will say to those on His right, Come, the blessed of My Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. For I hungered, and you gave Me food to eat; I thirsted, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in;

36. naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.

37. Then the righteous will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry, and fed You ; or thirsting, and gave You drink?

38. And when did we see You a stranger, and took You in; or naked, and clothed You ?

39. And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and came to You?

40. And answering, the King will say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you did it to Me.

41. Then He will also say to those on His left, Go away from Me, cursed ones, into the everlasting fire having been prepared for the Devil and his angels.

42. For I hungered, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I thirsted, and you gave me nothing to drink;

43. I was a stranger, and you did not take Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.

44. Then they also will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?

45. Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of these, the least, neither did you do it to Me.

46. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.  

## Matthew 26

1. And it happened, when Jesus finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples,

2. You know that the Passover is coming after two days, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

3. Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people were assembled to the court of the high priest, the one named Caiaphas.

4. And they plotted together in order that they might seize Jesus by guile and kill Him .

5. But they said, Not during the feast, that there be no uproar among the people.   

6. And Jesus being in Bethany, in Simon the leper's house,

7. a woman came to Him having an alabaster vial of ointment, very precious. And she poured it on His head as He reclined.

8. But seeing, His disciples were indignant, saying, For what is this waste?

9. For this ointment could have been sold for much and be given to the poor.

10. But knowing, Jesus said to them, Why do you cause trouble to the woman? For she worked a good work toward Me.

11. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.

12. For in putting this ointment on My body, she did it in order to bury Me.

13. Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in all the world, what she did will be spoken of as a memorial of her.   

14. Then one of the twelve going to the chief priests, the one named Judas Iscariot,

15. said, What will you give to me, and I will deliver Him up to you? "And they weighed to him thirty silver pieces." Zech. 11:12

16. And from then he sought opportunity that he might betray Him.   

17. And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where do you desire we should prepare for You to eat the Passover?

18. And He said, Go into the city to a certain one and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near; to you I will prepare the Passover with My disciples.

19. And the disciples did as Jesus ordered them, and prepared the Passover.

20. And evening coming, He reclined with the Twelve.

21. And as they were eating, He said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.

22. And grieving exceedingly, they began to say to Him, each of them, Lord, not I am the one ?

23. But answering, He said, The one dipping the hand with Me in the dish will betray Me.

24. Indeed, the Son of man goes, as it has been written about Him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed. It were good for him if that man was never born.

25. And answering, the one betraying Him, Judas, said, Not I am the one , Rabbi? He said to him, You said it .   

26. And as they ate, taking the bread and blessing it , Jesus broke and gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body.

27. And taking the cup, and giving thanks, He gave to them, saying, Drink all of it.

28. For this is My blood of the New Covenant which concerning many is being poured out for remission of sins.

29. But I say to you, I will not at all drink of this fruit of the vine after this until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.

30. And singing a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.   

31. Then Jesus said to them, You all will be offended in Me during this night. For it has been written, "I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered." Zech. 13:7

32. But after My resurrection I will go before you into Galilee.

33. And answering, Peter said to Him, Even if all will be offended in You, I will never be offended.

34. Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, During this night, before a cock crows, you will deny Me three times.

35. Peter said to Him, Even if it were necessary for me to die with You, I will in no way deny You. And all the disciples said the same.   

36. Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, Sit here, until going away, I shall pray there.

37. And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to grieve and to be deeply troubled.

38. Then He said to them, My soul is deeply grieved, even unto death. Stay here and watch with Me.

39. And going forward a little, He fell on His face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will .

40. And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, So! Were you not able to watch one hour with Me?

41. Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. Again, going away a second time, He prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me without My drinking it, let Your will be done.

43. And coming, He again found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

44. And leaving them, going away again, He prayed a third time, saying the same word.

45. Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on, and rest for what time remains. Behold, the hour draws near, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

46. Rise up, let us go. Behold, the one betraying Me draws near.   

47. And as He was yet speaking, behold, Judas came, one of the Twelve. And with him was a numerous crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. And the one betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I may kiss, it is He; seize Him.

49. And coming up at once to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi. And he ardently kissed Him.

50. But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then coming up, they laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.

51. And, behold, one of those with Jesus, stretching out the hand, drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.

52. Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword shall perish by a sword.

53. Or do you think that I am not able now to call on My Father, and He will place beside Me more than twelve legions of angels?

54. How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?

55. In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out to take Me with swords and clubs, as against a robber? I sat with you daily teaching in the temple, and you did not lay hands on Me.

56. But all this is happening that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples ran away, forsaking Him.   

57. And those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

58. And Peter followed Him from a distance, even to the court of the high priest. And going inside, he sat with the under-officers to see the end.

59. And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrin looked for false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death,

60. but did not find any , even though there were many false witnesses coming forward, they did not find any. But at last, coming up two false witnesses

61. said, This one said, I am able to destroy the Holy Place of God, and in three days to build it.

62. And standing up, the high priest said to Him, Do you answer nothing? What do these witness against you?

63. But Jesus kept silent. And answering, the high priest said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus said to him, You said it . I tell you more. From this time you shall see the Son of man sitting off the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of the heavens. Psa. 110:1; LXX-Dan. 7:13

65. Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He blasphemed! Why do we have any more need of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.

66. What does it seem to you? And answering, they said, He is liable to death.

67. Then they spat in His face, and beat Him with the fist, and some slapped Him ,

68. saying, Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is the one that struck you?   

69. And Peter sat outside in the court. And one girl came near to him, saying, And you were with Jesus the Galilean.

70. But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what you say.

71. And he, going out into the porch, another saw him and said to those there, And this one was with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

73. And after a little, coming near, those standing by said to Peter, Truly you also are of them, for even your speech makes you known.

74. Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately a cock crowed.

75. And Peter recalled the word of Jesus, saying to him, Before a cock crows, you will deny Me three times. And going out, he wept bitterly.  

## Matthew 27

1. And it becoming early morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together against Jesus, so as to put Him to death.

2. And binding Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

3. Then Judas, the one betraying Him, seeing that He was condemned, repenting, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,

4. saying, I sinned, betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is it to us? You see to it .

5. And tossing the silver pieces into the Holy Place, he left. And going away he hanged himself.

6. And taking the pieces of silver, the chief priests said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.

7. And taking counsel, they bought of them the potter's field, for burial for the strangers.

8. So that field was called Field of Blood until today.

9. Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who had been priced, on whom they of the sons of Israel set a price,

10. and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me. Zech. 11:12, 13   

11. And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say it .

12. And when He was accused by the chief priests and the elders, He answered nothing.

13. Then Pilate said to Him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?

14. And He did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor greatly marveled.

15. And at a feast, the governor customarily released one prisoner to the crowd, whom they wished.

16. And they had then a notable prisoner named Barabbas.

17. Then they, having been assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom do you wish I may release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus called Christ?

18. For he knew they delivered Him up through envy.

19. But as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Let nothing be to you and that just one. For I have suffered many things today by a dream because of him.

20. But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds, that they should ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.

21. And answering, the governor said to them, From the two, which do you wish that I release to you? And they said, Barabbas.

22. Pilate said to them, What then should I do to Jesus called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified.

23. But the governor said, For what wrong did he do? But they the more cried out, saying, Let him be crucified.

24. And seeing that nothing is gained, but rather an uproar occurs, taking water, Pilate washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just one; you will see.

25. And answering, all the people said, His blood be on us and on our children.   

26. Then he released Barabbas to them. But having flogged Jesus, he delivered Him up that He might be crucified.

27. Then taking Jesus into the praetorium, the soldiers of the governor gathered all the cohort against Him.

28. And stripping Him, they put a scarlet cloak around Him.

29. And plaiting a crown of thorns, they placed it on His head, and a reed in His right hand . And bowing the knee before Him, they mocked at Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews.

30. And spitting at Him, they took the reed and struck at His head.

31. And when they had mocked Him, they stripped off His cloak, and they put His garments on Him and led Him away to crucify Him .

32. And going out, they found a man, a Cyrenean, named Simon. They forced this one to bear His cross.   

33. And coming to a place called Golgotha, which is called, Place of a Skull,

34. they gave Him vinegar mingled with gall to drink. And having tasted, He would not drink.

35. And having crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting a lot, that might be fulfilled that spoken by the prophet, "They divided My garments to themselves, and they cast a lot over My clothing." Psa. 22:18

36. And sitting down, they guarded Him there.

37. And they put up over His head His charge, it having been written: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one off the right, and one off the left of Him .

39. But those passing by, blasphemed Him, shaking their heads,

40. and saying, You destroying the Holy Place and building it in three days, if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.

41. And in the same way, the chief priests with the scribes and elders, mocking, said,

42. He saved others; he is not able to save himself. If he is the king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him.

43. He trusted on God. Let Him rescue him now, if He desires him. For he said, I am Son of God.

44. And also the robbers crucified with Him reviled Him, saying the same.

45. And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.

46. And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani; that is, "My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?" Psa. 22:1

47. And hearing, some of those standing there said, This one calls Elijah.

48. And at once, one of them running and taking a sponge, and filling it with "vinegar," put it on a reed and "gave drink to Him." Psa. 69:21

49. But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.   

50. And crying again with a loud voice, Jesus released His spirit.

51. And, behold, the veil of the Holy Place was torn into two from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were sheared!

52. And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.

53. And coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and were revealed to many.

54. But the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things taking place, they feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this One was Son of God.

55. And many women were there, watching from afar off, those who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him;

56. among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.   

57. And evening having come, a rich man from Arimathea (Joseph by name) who also himself was discipled to Jesus,

58. coming up to Pilate, this one asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.

59. And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen,

60. and laid it in his new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. And rolling a great stone to the door of the tomb, he departed.

61. And there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting across from the grave.

62. And on the morrow, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were assembled to Pilate,

63. saying, Sir, we have recalled that that deceiver while living said, After three days I will rise.

64. Therefore, command that the grave be secured until the third day, that his disciples may not come by night and steal him away, and may say to the people, He is raised from the dead. And the last deception will be worse than the first.

65. And Pilate said to them, You have a guard, go away, make it as secure as you know how .

66. And going along with the guard, they made the grave secure, sealing the stone.  

## Matthew 28

1. But after the sabbaths, at the dawning of the first of the sabbaths, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the grave.

2. And, behold! A great earthquake occurred! For descending from Heaven and coming near, an angel of the Lord rolled away the stone from the door and was sitting on it.

3. And his face was as lightning and his clothing white as snow.

4. And those keeping guard were shaken from the fear of him, and they became as dead.

5. But answering, the angel said to the women, You must not fear, for I know that you seek Jesus who has been crucified.

6. He is not here, for He was raised, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.

7. And going quickly say to His disciples that He was raised from the dead. And behold! He goes before you into Galilee. You will see Him there. Behold! I told you.

8. And going away from the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to His disciples.

9. But as they were going to report to His disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, Hail! And coming near, they seized His feet and worshiped Him.

10. Then Jesus said to them, Do not fear. Go tell your brothers that they may go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.   

11. And they, having gone, behold, some of the guard coming into the city reported to the chief priests all things that occurred.

12. And being assembled with the elders, and taking counsel, they gave enough silver to the soldiers,

13. saying, Say that his disciples came and stole him by night, we being asleep.

14. And if this is heard by the governor, we will persuade him and will make you free from anxiety.

15. And taking the silver, they did as they were taught. And this report was spread by the Jews until today.   

16. But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mount where Jesus appointed them.

17. And seeing Him, they worshiped Him. But they doubted.

18. And coming up Jesus talked with them, saying, All authority in Heaven and on earth was given to Me.

19. Going, then, disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

20. teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days until the completion of the age. Amen.
