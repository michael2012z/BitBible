# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. PAULOS, an apostle of Jeshu Meshiha by the will of Aloha, and on account of the promise of life which is in Jeshu Meshiha,

2. to Timotheos my beloved son: grace and mercies and peace from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

3. I thank Aloha, whom I serve from my fathers with a pure conscience, that constantly I remember thee in my prayers of the night and of the day;

4. and have longed to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy:

5. in remembrance of thee (and) of thy true faith which dwelt first in the mother of thy mother Lois, and in thy mother Eunika, and which, I am persuaded, (is) in thee also.

6. On account of this I put thee in mind to keep awake the gift of Aloha, which is in thee by the laying on of my hands.

7. For Aloha hath not given to us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of discipline.Marathyonutho.

8. Wherefore be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but sustain evil with the gospel, through the power of Aloha,

9. who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his will, and that grace of his which was given to us in Jeshu Meshiha before the time of the worlds,

10. and is now revealed by the revelation of our Saviour Jeshu Meshiha, who hath abolished death, and hath demonstrated life and incorruption, through the gospel,

11. of which I am appointed an herald and an apostle and a teacher of the nations:

12. on account of which I suffer these, and am not ashamed. I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded that there is power in his hands my deposite to keep for me unto that day.

13. Let the outlineOr, model: chauro, from chor, "to look at with attention, to contemplate." Melee chlimotho may be rendered "healthy words, or wholesome doctrines." of sound words be with thee, which thou hast heard from me, with the faith and love which are in Jeshu Meshiha:

14. that good deposite keep through the Spirit of Holiness who dwelleth in us.

15. Know this, that all those of Asia are turned from me, of whom are Phygellos and Harmogenes.

16. Our Lord give mercies to the house of Onesiphoros, who many times hath refreshed me, and of the chains of my bonds hath not been ashamed.

17. But when also he came to Ruma, with diligence he sought me, and found me.

18. Our Lord grant that he may find mercies with our Lord in that day: and how he ministered to me in Ephesos thou especially knowest.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

2. And those (doctrines) which thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, them commit to faithful men, who are also able to teach others.

3. And endure evils as a good soldier of Jeshu Meshiha.

4. No man serveth as a soldier, and entangleth himself with the affairs of the world, that he might please him who hath chosen him.

5. And if one contendeth, he is not crowned, unless according to his law he contend.

6. It becometh the husbandman who laboureth that he should first eat of his fruits.

7. Understand what I say to thee. Our Lord give thee wisdom in all things.

8. Remember Jeshu Meshiha, that he arose from among the dead, he who is of the seed of David, according to my gospel;

9. for which I endure evils unto bonds, as an evil-doer: but the word of Aloha is not bound.

10. Therefore I endure every thing on account of the elect, that they also may find salvation in Jeshu Meshiha, with the glory that is eternal.

11. Faithful is the word: For if we be dead with him, With him also we shall live;

12. And if we endure, We shall also reign with him; But, if we deny him, He also will deny us!

13. And if we believe him not, He in his faithfulness abideth; For deny himself he cannot.

14. Of these (truths) remind them, and testify before our Lord, that they contend not with unprofitable words, to the overturning of those who hear them.

15. And be careful to establish thyself perfectly before Aloha, a workman without shame, preaching rightly the word of truth.

16. From vain words which have no utility in them withdraw; for they add greatly to the wickedness of those who are occupied with them.

17. And their words as an eating cancer will lay hold upon many: but one of them is Hymeneos, and another Philetos,

18. who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection of the dead hath been, and the faith of some overturning.

19. But the true foundation of Aloha standeth; and it hath this signature: And the Lord knoweth them who are his. And, Let every one who invoketh the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.

20. But in a great house there are not vessels of gold only or of silver, but also of wood, also of clay: of them (some are) to honour, and of them (some) to dishonour.

21. If a man then purify himself from these, he will be a pure vessel unto honour, fitted for the use of his Lord, and prepared for every good work.

22. From all the lusts of youth escape; and pursueOr, run after. after righteousness, and faith, and charity, and peace, with them who call upon the Lord with a pure heart.

23. From foolish controversies which are without instruction withdraw; for thou knowest that they beget strifes.Fightings.

24. But a servant of the Lord oweth not to strive,Fight. but to be gentle towards every man, and teaching, and long-suffering,

25. that he may instruct them who would contend against him with meekness, if by any means Aloha may give them conversion, and they may acknowledge the truth,

26. and be mindful of themselves, and remove from the snare of Satana, by whom they have been entrapped at his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But know this, that in the last days hard times will come;

2. and men will be lovers of themselves, and lovers of money, boastful, lofty, blasphemous, to their men not obedient, deniers of grace, impious, calumniators,

3. subjected to lust, brutal, haters of the good,

4. traitors, impetuous,Or, hasty. puffed up, lovers of lusts rather than the love of Aloha;

5. having a form of the worship of Aloha, but from the power of Aloha afar off: (them) who are such put from thee.

6. For of them are they who creep into houses, and captivate women who are overladen with sins, and led away by divers lusts;

7. who, in all time learning, never to the knowledge of the truth are able to come.

8. But as Yonis and Yanbris stood against Musha, so also these stand against the truth: men whose understanding is corrupted, and reprobate from the faith.

9. But they shall not come further, for their folly is known to all men, as also of them it is known.

10. BUT thou hast followedAth ethaith bothar. my doctrine and my manners, and my purpose, and my faith, and my prolongedness of mind, and my charity, and my patience,

11. and my persecution, and my sufferings. And thou knowest what things I endured in Antioch, and in Ikonion, and in Lystra, what persecution I endured; and out of all these my Lord delivered me.

12. But all they who will in the fear of Aloha to live in Jeshu Meshiha, are persecuted.

13. But wicked men and seducers add to their wickedness, deceiving, and being deceived.

14. But abide thou in those things that thou hast learned, and in which thou art confirmed; for thou knowest from whom thou hast learned:

15. and that from thy childhood thou hast learned the holy writings, which are able to make thee wise to salvation, through faith which is in Jeshu Meshiha.

16. FOR all scripture which from the Spirit is written, is profitable for doctrine, and for rebuke, and for correction, and for instructionOr, discipline. which is in righteousness:

17. that the man of God may be perfect unto every good work, and completed.

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I attest thee before Aloha, and our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, who is to judge the living and the dead at the revelation of his kingdom:

2. preach the word, and stand with diligence in season, and (that) which is not season; confute, and rebuke with all prolongedness of mind and doctrine.

3. For the time will come, when sound doctrine they will not hear; but according to their desires will multiply to themselves teachers, in the itching of their hearing.

4. And from the truth they will turn away their ear, but to fables will decline.

5. But watch thou in every thing, and endure evils, and work the work of an evangelist, and thy ministry fulfil.

6. But I am sacrificed, and the time when I shall be dissolved cometh.

7. The good agony I have fought, and my running I have completed, and my faith I have kept.

8. And from now there is kept for me the crown of righteousness, which my Lord will give me in that day, because he is a righteous judge: yet, not only to me, but to all them who love his manifestation.

9. BE careful to come to me speedily;

10. for Dema hath left me, and hath loved this world, and is gone to Thessalonika; Krispos to Galatia, Titos to Dalmatia;

11. Luka only is with me. Take Markos and bring him with thee; for helpful to me is he in the ministry.

12. But Tykikos have I sent to Ephesos.

13. The case (for) books which I left at Troas with Karpos, when thou comest bring, and the books, and especially the roll of parchments.

14. Alexander the brass-worker many evils hath showed me: our Lord awardeth to him according to his deeds.

15. But be thou also aware of him, for he is much uplifted against our words.

16. In the first defence no man was with me, but all of them left me. May this not be reckoned to them!

17. But my Lord stood with me, that by me the preaching might be fulfilled, and (that) all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered from the mouth of the lion.

18. And my Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me into his kingdom, which is in heaven. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

19. Give salutation to Priskela, and to Akilos, and to the house of Onesiphoros.

20. Erastos remains at Kurinthos; but Trophimos I left ill in Miletos the city.

21. Be careful to come before winter. Ebulos and Pudis, and Linos, and Klaudia, and all the brethren, ask for your peace.

22. Our Lord Jeshu Meshiha be with thy spirit. Grace be with thee. Amen.
