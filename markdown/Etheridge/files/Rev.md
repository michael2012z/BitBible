## Revelation 1

1. THE Revelation of Jeshu Meshiha, which Aloha gave unto him, to show unto his servants the things which must be done speedily; and which he made known, sending by his angel unto his servant Juhanon,

2. who attested the word of Aloha and the testimony of Jeshu Meshiha, and all which he beheld.

3. Blessed is he who readeth, and they who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those which are written therein; for the time hath approached.

4. Juhanon to the seven churches which are in Asia: grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who cometh;D'othe. from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;

5. and from Jeshu Meshiha who is the faithful Witness, the First-born of the dead, and Head of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and releasedSharo, solvit. us from our sins by his blood,

6. and hath made us a priestly kingdomMalkutho koknoitho, regnum sacerdotale. unto Aloha and his Father; to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

7. Behold, he cometh with clouds, and all eyes shall see him, and they also who transfixedDadaqruhi. him; and for him shall mourn all the tribes of the earth. Yes, Amen!

8. I am Olaph and Thau, saith Aloha the Lord, who is, and who was, and who cometh, the Omnipotent.Lit. Achid kul, The holder or upholder of all. So throughout.

9. I, Juhanon your brother, and your fellow-sharer in the affliction, and in the patience, which are in Jeshu Meshiha, was in the island which is called Pathamon, for the word of Aloha and for the testimony of Jeshu Meshiha.

10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day;Yaumo moronoio. and I heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet, saying,

11. What thou seest, write in a book; and send to the seven churches, at Ephesos, and at Smurna, and at Pergamos, and at Thiatira, and at Sardis, and at Philidaphia,Thus spelt in the Syriac copies. and at Laodikia.

12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me; and being turned, I saw seven candlesticks of gold.

13. And in the midst of the candlesticks (one) who was like the Son of man, clothed to the foot, and girded about his paps with a circlet of gold.

14. But his head and hair were white as wool, white as snow; and his eyes (were) as a flame of fire,

15. and his feet were like refined brass,Nechosho Lebanonoio. The- of the Greek text. which flamed as in a furnace, and his voice as the voice of many waters.

16. And he had in his right hand seven stars; and from his mouth a sharp sword of two edges went forth; and his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength.

17. And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid upon me his right hand, saying, Fear not: I am the First and the Last;

18. and who liveth and who have been dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever and ever. Amen! And I have the keys of death and of Sheul.

19. Write, then, what thou hast seen; and those which are, and those which are to be after them.

20. (This is) the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and of the seven candlesticks of gold: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the church which is in Ephesos, write: These saith the Holder of all,Achid Kul. and of the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold.

2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and (that) thou canst not bear evils; and hast tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars.

3. And thou hast patience, and hast laboured on account of my name, and hast not fainted.

4. But I have against thee, because thy first love thou hast forsaken.

5. Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works. But if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick from its place, if thou convert not.

6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nikolitu, which also I (hate).

7. He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him who overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.

8. And to the angel of the church which is in Smurna, write: These saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and liveth.

9. I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty, but thou art rich; and the blasphemy of them who say of themselves that they are Jihudoyee, and are not, but the synagogue of Satana.

10. Fear not any thing of those that thou art to suffer; for, behold, it will be that the accuser will cast some of you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.

11. He who hath ears, let him hear what saith the Spirit to the churches. He who overcometh shall not be injured by the second death.

12. And to the angel of the church which is in Pergamos, write: These saith he who hath the sharp sword with two edges.

13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where (is) the throne of Satana; and thou hast held my name, and not denied my faith in those days when my witness was exposed,Or, became a spectacle. But, instead of ETHCHAZAITH, spectaculum factus est, the Polyglots read ETHCHARITH AM; " Thou wast in conflict along with my witness, my faithful one." my faithful one, who was killed with you where dwelleth Satana.

14. But I have against thee a little," A few things."-POLYGLOT. because thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Belam, who taught Balok to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat that which the sons of idols (eat), and to commit fornication.

15. So hast thou who hold the doctrine of the Nikolitu: of it,

16. in like (manner), repent; and if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will war against them with the sword of my mouth.

17. He who hath ears, let him hear what saith the Spirit to the churches. To him who overcometh will I give to eat of the manna which is hidden; and I will give to him the white stone,Chushbono, rationale. Query, a breastplate? and upon the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth but he who receiveth.

18. And to the angel and churchSo SCHAFF'S text, but not WALTON'S. which is in Thiatiros, write: These saith the Son of Aloha, who hath his eyes as the flame of fire, and his feet like refined brass.

19. I know thy works, and thy love and faith and service; and also thy patience, and thy last works to be greater than the first.

20. But I have against thee that thou permittest thy wife Izabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat what the sons of idolsWALTON, " To eat the sacrifices of idols." (eat).

21. And I gave her time when she might convert, and she willed not to repent of her fornication.

22. Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who have committed adultery with her into great affliction, if they repent not of their works.

23. And her sons will I kill with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and the hearts: and I will give to you every one according to your works.

24. But to you I say, to those of the rest who are in Thiatiros, all them who have not this doctrine, the men who know not the depthsAmïkthö. Of Satana, as they speak; I will not throw upon you another burden;

25. but that which you have, hold, until I come.

26. And he who conquereth, and he who keepeth until the end my works, I will give to him powerShultono. over the peoples,

27. and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as a vessel of the potter shall they be destroyed, as also I have received from my Father;

28. and I will give to him the morning star.

29. He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

## Revelation 3

1. AND to the angel who is in Sardis write: These saith he who hath the seven Spirits of Aloha, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that a name thou hast that thou livest, and thou art dead.

2. Awake, and keep those things which remain, which are about to die; for I have not found thy works complete before my God.

3. Remember then how thou hast received, and hearken, and keep, and repent. And if then thou wilt not awake, I will come against thee as the thief, and thou shalt not know in what hour I come against thee.

4. But thou hast a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their vestments; and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.

5. He who overcometh shall be clothed in white vestments, and I will not blot theirShemo dilhun. name from the book of life; and I will confess their name before my Father, and before his angels.

6. He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

7. And to the angel of the church which is in Philadelphia write: These saith the Holy, the True, who hath the key of David; who openeth and no man shutteth,Lit. holdeth. and who shutteth and no man openeth.

8. I know thy works; and, behold, I have given before thee an open door, which no man can shut; because thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

9. Behold, I will giveto those of the synagogue of Satana, who say that they are Jihudoyee, and are not, but lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and they shall know that I have loved thee.

10. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which is to come upon all the habitable world, to try them who dwell upon the earth.

11. I come quickly. Hold that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.

12. Him who overcometh I will make a column in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and of Urishlem the new, which descendeth from heaven from my God, and my new name.

13. He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

14. And to the angel of the church which is in Ladikia write: These saith the Amen, the Witness, the faithful, the true, the Head of the creation of Aloha.

15. I know thy works, that thou art neither hot nor cold. Would that thou wast cold or hot!

16. So, because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit thee from my mouth.

17. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have become opulent, and of nothing have need; and knowest not that thou art infirm, and miserable, and needy, and blind, and naked;

18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold, proved by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness be not seen; and lave with collyrium thine eyes, that thou mayest see.

19. All those whom I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and will open the door, I will enter unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

21. And to him who overcometh I will give to sit with me upon my throne, as also I have overcome, and have sat with my Father in his throne.

22. He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.

## Revelation 4

1. AFTER these I saw, and, behold, a door (was) open in heaven. And the first voice that I had heard as a trumpet talking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will make thee see the (things) which must be after these.

2. At once I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throneKursio, a seat of state. placed in heaven, and upon the throne (One) sat.

3. And he who sat was like to the appearance of the stone of jaspon, and of sardion; and the bow of the clouds was around the throne, in resemblance to the appearance of zmragda.

4. Around the throneThronos. were seatsKursothee. twenty and four; and upon those seats twenty and four presbytersKashishee. sitting, who were robed in white vestments, and upon their heads wore coronetsKalilee. of gold.

5. And from the throne went forth lightnings and the voice of thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire which burned before His throne, which are the seven Spirits of Aloha.

6. And before the throne was a sea of brightnessZagugitho, Heb. Zechuchith; root, zakak, to shine, be transparent. like chrystalos; and in the midst of the throne, and around it, and before the throne, four living-ones,Chaivothee, " animated beings; " from chai, " to live." who were full of eyes before and behind.

7. And the first living-one was like the lion, and the second living-one was like the calf, and the third living-one had a face as a man, and the fourth living-one was like the eagle which flieth.

8. And these four living-ones, each of them, had six wings round about; and within were full of eyes; and they rest not day and night from saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who wast, and art, and art to come.

9. And when those living-ones give glory and honour and thanksMore strictly, (kubol-taibutho,) acceptance of thanks, that is, as by the divine hand. unto Him who sitteth upon the throne, to Him who liveth for ever and ever,

10. the four and twenty presbyters fell before Him who sitteth upon the throne, and worshipped Him who liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. Worthy art thou, O Lord, And our God the Holy One, To receive glory and honour and power; For thou hast created all, And by thy hand they are, And through thy will they were and are created.

## Revelation 5

1. AND I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a writing which was written within and on the back, and sealedTabi. with seven seals.Tabee.

2. And I saw a mighty angel who proclaimed with a great voice: Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

3. And no one was able, in heaven above, nor upon earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, or to inspect it.

4. And I wept much, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book, or to inspect it.

5. And one of the presbyters said to me, Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Jihuda, who is the root of David, hath prevailed. He will open the book and the seven sealChetomee. thereof.

6. And I saw, in the midst of the presbyters, a Lamb standing, as slain, who had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of Aloha, which are sent forth to all the earth.

7. And he came and took the book from the right hand of him who sat upon the throne.

8. And when he had taken the book, the four living-ones and the twenty and four presbyters fell down before the Lamb, having each of them an harp, and vials of gold full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they hymned a new hymn, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, And to open the seals thereof; Because thou wast slain, And hast redeemed us to Aloha by thy blood, From every tribe and tongue and people and nation.

10. And thou hast made themEnun. to our God kings and priests, And reigning upon the earth.

11. And I saw and heard as the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living-ones, and the presbyters, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,

12. which said with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, And honour, and glory, and blessing,

13. And every creature which is in heaven, and on earth, And under the earth, and in the sea, And all them which are therein. And I heard him who sat upon the throne saying: To the Lamb let there be given blessing, and honour, and glory, and praise, and dominion, for ever and ever.

14. And the four living-ones said, Amen! And the presbyters fell, and worshipped.

## Revelation 6

1. AND I saw, when the Lamb had opened one of the SEVEN SEALS. And I heard one of the four living-ones speaking as the voice of thunder, Come, and see!

2. And I looked: and there was a white horse; and he who sat upon him had a bow, and there was given to him a crown; and he went forth conquering, so that he might conquer.

3. And when he had opened the SECOND SEAL, I heard the second living-one, who said, Come!

4. And there went out another horse (which was) red; and to him who sat upon him was given to take peace from the earth, and thus that one another they should kill; and there was given to him a great sword.

5. And when he had opened the THIRD SEAL, I heard the third living one, saying, Come, and see! And I saw, and, behold, a black horse, and he who sat upon him had a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice from the midst of the four living-ones, saying, A choenix of wheat for a dinar; And three choenices of barley for a dinar; And the oil and the wine hurt not.

7. And when he had opened the FOURTH SEAL, I heard the fourth living-one, saying, Come, and see!

8. And I saw a green horse,Susio Uroko. and he who sat upon him had the name of Death, and Shiul followed after him. And there was given to him power over the fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the toothed beast of the earth.

9. And when he had opened the FIFTH SEAL, I saw under the altar the souls of them who had been killed for the word of Aloha, and for the testimony of the Lamb, which had been theirs.

10. And they cried with a great voice, saying, Until when, O Lord, holy (and) true, Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood On those who dwell upon the earth?

11. And there was given to each of them the white robe; and it was told them, that they should rest yet a little time, until should be completed their fellow-servants, their brethren who would be killed as also they.

12. And I saw when he opened the SIXTH SEAL, there was a great movement; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and all the moon became as blood;

13. and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as the fig-tree casteth her figs, when from a great wind she is shaken.

14. And the heavens were sunderedEthphareshu. as a book that is rolled, and all the mountains and islands from their places were moved;

15. and the kings of the earth and great ones, and the chiefs of thousands, and the rich and the mighty ones, and every servant, and every freeman, hid them in the caverns, and in the rocks of the mountains,

16. saying to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.

17. For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. AND after these, I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the winds should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon the trees.

2. And I saw another angel, and he ascended from the rising of the sun; who had the seal of Aloha the Living. And he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea,

3. saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, neither the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of them who were sealed, an hundred and forty and four thousands, sealed of every tribe of Israel:

5. of the tribe of Jihuda, twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Rubill, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;

6. of the tribe of Ashir, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtoli, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasha, twelve thousand;

7. of the tribe of Shemun, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Isokar, twelve thousand;

8. of the tribe of Zabolon, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Jauseph, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjomin, twelve thousandwere sealed.

9. After these I saw, and, behold, a great assembly, which to number no man was able, from all people and nations and tribes and tongues, were standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and with palms in their hands;

10. and, crying with a great voice, said, Salvation to our God! To him who sitteth on the throne, And to the Lamb!

11. And all the angels stood around the throne, and the presbyters, and the four living-ones; and they fell before his throne upon their faces, and worshipped Aloha,

12. saying, Amen. Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, And honour, and might, and power, To our God, for ever and ever. Amen.

13. And one of the presbyters answered and said to me: These, who are arrayed in white robes, who are they? and from whence do they come?

14. And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who have come from great affliction, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. On account of this they are before the throne of Aloha, and minister to him day and night in his temple. And he who sitteth upon the throne will protect them.Nageen alihun, " shadow over them."

16. They will not hunger or thirst again, nor will the sun come down upon them, nor any heat;

17. for it is the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne who will feed them, and will lead them unto fountains of living waters, and Aloha will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. AND when he had opened the SEVENTH SEAL, silence was in heaven, as the dividing of an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before Aloha, and there were given to them SEVEN TRUMPETS.

3. And another angel came, and stood at the altar, and he had a censer of gold, and many perfumes were given to him, which he should give with the prayers of all saints upon the altar of gold that is before the throne;

4. and the cloudAtaro. of the perfumes of the prayers of the saints ascended from the hand of the angel before Aloha.

5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast forth upon the earth. And there were thunders, and lightnings, and voices, and movement.

6. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared them to sound. And the First sounded.

7. And there was hail, and fire mingled with the waters, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third of the earth burned, and the third of the trees burned, and every green herb burned.

8. And the Second angel sounded. And as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third of the sea also became blood.

9. And the third of all creatures which were in the sea, which had lives, died, and the third of the ships were destroyed.

10. And the Third angel sounded. And there fell from heaven a star burning as a lamp, and it fell upon the third of the rivers, and upon fountains of waters.

11. And the name of the star is called Aphsinthos; and the third of the waters became bitterness, and many men died from the waters because they were bitter.

12. And the Fourth angel sounded. And the third of the sun was absorbed, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, as that the third of them should be darkened; and they were darkened, and the day shone not a third of it, and the night, in like manner.

13. And I beheld, and heard an eagle, An eagle. This is considered a good reading, and has been given by Griesbach in his Greek text. flying in the midst, having a tail of blood,Here the Syrian translator was at fault. His Greek copy, without separating the words, read, "in the midst of heaven;" which he appears to have decomposed thus: ("the midst") + ("a tail") + ("blood,") so as to produce the singular expression given above. saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, to those who dwell upon earth, from the voice of the rest of the trumpets of the three angels which are about to sound!

## Revelation 9

1. AND the Fifth angel sounded. And I saw a star which fell from heaven unto the earth and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.

2. And he opened the pit of the abyss,Biro dathumo. and smoke ascended from the pit, as the smoke of a burning furnace; and the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the pit.

3. And from the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth. And there was given to them power such as scorpions have upon the earth.

4. And it was told them, that they should not hurt the herbage of the earth, nor any green (thing), nor any tree, but only those men who had not the seal of Aloha upon their foreheads.

5. And it was given them, that they should not kill them, but torture them five months. And their torture was as the torture of a scorpion when he striketh a man.

6. And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not find; and shall desire to die, and death will flee from them.

7. And the likeness of those locusts (was this): they resemble the appearanceOr, they are like as the likeness of. of horses prepared for battle. And upon their heads (was) a crown of the likeness of gold; and their faces (were) as the faces of men.

8. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as of lions;

9. and they had breast-plates as breast-plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of the chariots of many horses running to battle.

10. And they had tails like those of scorpions, and stings; and in their tails they have power to hurt men five months.

11. And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss, and his name in Hebrew is Abadon; but in Javanith his name is Apolon.

12. One woe hath gone. Behold, two woes yet come after it.

13. And the Sixth angel sounded. And I heard one voice from the horns of the altar of gold which was before Aloha,

14. saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels which are bound in the great river Phraat.

15. And the four angels were released, they who were prepared for an hour, and for a day, and for a month, and for a year, to kill the third (part) of men.

16. And the number of the host of the horsemen was two myriads of myriads. I heard the number of them.

17. And as I beheld those horses in the vision, and those who sat upon them, (I saw that) they had breast-plates of fire, and jacinth, and sulphur; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and from their mouths went out fire, and smoke, and sulphur.

18. And by these three plagues were the third of men killed; from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the sulphur which went out of their mouths.

19. For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents which had heads, and with them they wound.

20. And the rest of men who were not killed by those plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons and idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear;

21. nor repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their robberies.

## Revelation 10

1. AND I saw another mighty angel descending from heaven, clothed (with a) cloud, and the bow of the cloud (was) upon his head; and his countenance was as the sun, and his feet as columns of fire.

2. And he had in his hand an open book; and he set his right foot upon the sea, but the left upon the land,

3. and cried with a great voice, as the roar of a lion. And when he had cried, seven thunders spoke their voices.

4. And when those seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven, which said, Seal those (things) which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not.

5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land, lifted his right hand to heaven,

6. and sware by Him who liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and those who are in it, and the earth and those that are in it, and the sea and those that are in it, That time no more shall be;

7. but (that) in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of Aloha shall be completed, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake with me again, and said, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the land.

9. And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the book. And he said to me, Take, and eat it; and it will embitter thee thy belly, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.

10. And I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it. And it was in my mouth as sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter.

11. And he said to me, It behoves thee yet to prophesy concerning many nations, and concerning peoples and princes and kings.

## Revelation 11

1. AND there was given to me a reed, like a staff; and the angel stood, saying, Arise, measure the temple of Aloha, and the altar, and them who worship therein;

2. and the court which is without the temple cast out,Aphek men lebar. and do not measure it, because it is given to the Gentiles, and the holy city shall be trodden down, MONTHS FORTY AND TWO.

3. And I will give my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy, DAYS A THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY, clothed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive (trees) and two candlesticks which before the Lord of the earth do stand.

5. And if a man willeth to wound them, fire cometh forth from their mouth, and devoureth their adversaries. And if a man willeth to wound (them), thus must he be killed.

6. These have power to shut heaven, that rain it may not rain in those days;" Days of prophecy."-POLYGLOTS. and power have they over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as many times as they will.

7. And when they shall have completed their testimony, the beast of prey, which ascended from the abyss, will make war against them, and overcome them,and kill them, Ibid.

8. and their dead bodies (will be) upon the wide street of the great city, which is called, spiritually, Sedum, and Metsreen, where also our Lord hath been crucified.

9. And of the peoples and tribes and nations and tongues, seeing their dead bodies days three and a half, will not suffer them to be laid in the tomb.

10. And they who dwell upon earth will rejoice over them and be gratified, and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented them who dwell upon earth.

11. And after those three days and a half, the spirit of life from Aloha entered into them, and they arose upon their feet. And great fear fell upon them who saw them.

12. And they heard"I heard."-POLYGLOTS. a great voice from heaven, saying to them, Ascend hither. And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their adversaries beheld them.

13. And in that hour there was a great movement; and one of ten of the city fell; and there were killed in the movement the names of men seven thousand. And they who were left were made afraid, and gave glory to Aloha.

14. That second woe hath passed. Behold, the third woe cometh quickly.

15. And the Seventh angel sounded. And there were voices and thunders, saying, The kingdom of the world Is of our Lord, and of his Meshiha; And he will reign for ever and ever!

16. And the twenty and four presbyters who were before the throne of Aloha, who were sitting upon their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped,

17. saying, We give thanks to thee, Lord God omnipotent, Who art, and who wast; Because thou hast taken thy great power, And hast reigned.

18. And the nations were angry; But thy wrath is come, And the time of the dead, That they should be avenged; And to give reward to thy servants, To the prophets, and to the saints, And to them who fear thy Name, To the small and to the great; And to destroy them who have destroyed the earth.

19. And the temple of Aloha was opened in heaven; and there was seen the ark of his covenant in his temple. And there were lightnings, and thunderings, and voices, and movement, and great hail.

## Revelation 12

1. AND a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon beneath her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.

2. And having in her womb, she cried, and was in travail, and was pained to give birth.

3. And I saw another sign in heaven; and behold a great dragon of fire, which had seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.

4. And his tail drew the third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman when she was about to give birth, that when she had given birth he might devour her son.

5. And she gave birth to a male child, who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her son was rapt unto Aloha and unto his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the desert, where she had a place prepared of Aloha, that there they might nourish her, DAYS A THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY.

7. And there was war in heaven. And Mikoel and his angelscame Polyglot. to fight with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels warred.

8. And they could not prevail, and their place was found no more in heaven.

9. And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, who is called the Deceiver, and the Adversary, which seduceth the whole habitable world. And he was cast upon the earth, and his angels with him were cast.

10. And I heard a great voice in heaven saying, Now is there salvation and strength, And the kingdom of our God, And the power of his Meshiha; Because the accuser of our brethren is cast down, Who accused them before Aloha day and night.

11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, And by the word of his testimony. But they loved not their lives unto death.

12. Wherefore let the heavens be glad, And those who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea! Because the deceiver hath gone down to you, Having great indignation, Knowing that little time is to him.

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast down upon the earth, he pursued the woman which gave birth to the son.

14. And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert unto her place, where she was to be nourished A TIME, AND TIMES, AND THE DIVIDING OF A TIME, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent cast forth from his mouth after the woman waters like a river, as that she might be carried off by the river which he would make.

16. And the earth succoured the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed the river which the dragon had cast forth from his mouth.

17. And the dragon raged against the woman, and went to make war with those of the rest of her seed which kept the commandments of Aloha, and had the testimony of Jeshu.

## Revelation 13

1. And he stood upon the sand of the sea. AND I saw that a beast of preyLiterally, (chaivith sheno,) a beast of the tooth, i. e., a carnivorous animal. The same expression occurs throughout. ascended from the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns seven diadems; and upon his heads names of blasphemy.

2. And the beast of prey which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as (those) of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave to him his power, and his throne, and great authority.

3. And one of his heads was wounded as to death. And his stroke of death was healed; and all the earth wondered after the beast of prey.

4. And they worshipped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast of prey, (saying, Who is like the beast of prey,)Polyglots. and who is able to make war with him?

5. And there was given him a mouth speaking great sayings and blasphemies, and authority was given him to act, MONTHS, FORTY AND TWO.

6. And he opened his mouth to blaspheme against Aloha, blaspheming his name, and his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.

7. And there was given to him authority over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation; and there was given to him to make war with the saints, to overcome them.

8. And all those who inhabit on the earth will worship him, they whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb from the foundation of the world.

9. If a man have ears, let him hear.

10. If any man into captivity leadeth, into captivity he shall go. If any man kill with the sword, it behoveth him by the sword to be killed. This is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11. And I saw another beast of prey ascending from the earth; and he had two horns like those of the lamb, and he spake as the dragon.

12. And all the authority of the first beast of prey he exercised before him; and he made the earth and those who inhabit therein to worship the first beast of prey, whose wound of death was healed.

13. And he wrought great signs, as that also he would make fire to come down from heaven upon earth before men.

14. And he will seduce those who dwell upon earth to the making an image of the beast of prey who had the wound of the sword and lived.

15. And it was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast of prey, (that the image also of the beast of prey should speak,)Polyglots. and to cause that all those whosoever who worshipped not the image of the beast of prey should be killed.

16. And he caused all, small and great, and rich and poor, and sons of freedom and slaves, to have given to them a signature upon their right hands, or upon their foreheads;

17. as that no man might be able to buy or sell, unless he had the signature of the name of the beast of prey, or the number of his name.

18. Here is wisdom. Let him who hath mind, calculate the number of the beast of prey; for the number is of man; and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.

## Revelation 14

1. AND I saw, and, behold, the Lamb stood upon the mountain of Sion, and with him the number, an hundred and forty and four thousand, who had his name, and the name of his Father, written upon their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of great thunder; and the voice which I heard was as harpers striking on their harps.

3. And they hymned a new hymn before the throne, and before the four living-ones, and the presbyters. And no man was able to learn the hymn, but the hundred and forty and four thousand (who were redeemed from the earth)Ibid..

4. These are they who with women have not been defiled, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goeth. These by Jeshu were redeemed from men, first-fruits unto Aloha and to the Lamb.

5. And in their mouth falsehood was not found, for they are without spot.

6. And I saw another angel flying through heaven, who with bloodSo SCHAFF, DE DlEU, and GUTBIR'S texts: but the Polyglots have not " with blood," a reading which admits of the same explanation as that given page 469. had the everlasting gospel to preach to them who dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe, and tongue and people;

7. saying with a great voice, Serve Aloha, and give him glory: For the hour of his judgment cometh: And worship him who made heaven and earth, And the sea, and the fountains of waters.

8. And another angel, a second, followed him, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babel the Great, Which of the wine of the rage of her fornication Hath made all nations to drink.

9. And another angel, a third, followed them saying with a great voice, If any man worship the beast of prey and his image, And receive his mark on his brow, or in his hand,

10. He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of Aloha, Which is mingled without sparingVide SCHLEUSNER, sub? (No. 2,) which is the word here incorporated into the Syrian text. In the cup of his anger. And he shall be tormented in fire and sulphur, Before his holy angels and before the throne:

11. And the smoke of their torment For ever and ever will ascend. And they have no rest day and night Who worship the beast of prey and his image.

12. Here is the patience of the saints, Who keep the commandments of Aloha, And the faith of Jeshu.

13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead Who in Aloha die from now. Yes, saith the Spirit, That they may rest from their labours, For their works follow with them.

14. And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud sat (one) like the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a great voice to him who sat upon the cloud.

16. And he thrust his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, having also a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel came forth from the altar who had authority over the fire, and he cried with a great cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and reap the clusters of the vintage of the earth; for the grapes of the earth are ripe.

19. And the angel thrust forth his sickle unto the earth, and reaped the vintage of the earth, and he cast into the winepress of the wrath of Aloha the Great.

20. And the winepress was trodden (without the city, and blood flowed from the winepress)Polyglot. unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand and six hundred stadia.

## Revelation 15

1. AND I saw another sign in heaven, great and wondrous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is completed the wrath of Aloha.

2. And I saw as a sea of brightness commingled with fire; and them who had won-the-victory from the beast of prey, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing on the sea of brightness, having the harps of Aloha.

3. And they sang the song of Musha the servant of Aloha, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wondrous are thy works, Lord God Omnipotent; Just and true are thy ways, King of ages!

4. Who shall not fear thee, Lord, And glorify thy name? For thou only artgood 2 and holy and just; Therefore all nations shall come And worship before thee; Because thy judgments are revealed.

5. After these I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony which is in heaven was opened.

6. And the seven angels came forth, having the seven plagues, from the temple, clothed in linen pure, resplendent, and girded at their breasts with zones of gold.

7. And one of the four living-ones gave to the seven angels SEVEN VIALS of gold, which were full of the wrath of Aloha, who liveth for ever and ever.

8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of Aloha, and from his power. And no man was able to enter the temple, until should be completed the seven plagues of the seven angels.

## Revelation 16

1. AND I heard a great voicefrom the temple 2 saying to the seven angels, Go, and pour forth the seven vials of the wrath of Aloha upon the earth.

2. And the first went, and poured his vial upon the earth: and there became an ulcer, evil and painful, upon the men who had the mark of the beast of prey, and who worshipped the image of him.

3. And the second angel poured his vial upon the sea; and it became blood as of the dead, and every living soul died which was in the sea.

4. And the third angel poured his vial upon the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art Thou, who art, And who wast, and just; Because thou hast judged these.

6. For the blood of saints and of prophets have they shed, And blood to them hast thou given to drink For they are worthy.

7. And I heard from the altarvoices saying, Yes, Lord God Almighty! True and just is thy judgment.

8. And the fourth poured out his vial upon the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire;

9. and men were scorched with great heat; and men blasphemed the name of Aloha who hath power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.

10. And the fifth poured his vial upon the throne of the beast of prey; and his kingdom became darkness, and they gnawed their tongues from pain;

11. and they blasphemed the God of heaven from their pains, and from their ulcers, and repented not of their works.

12. And the sixth poured his vial upon the great river Phrat, and his waters were dried, that might be prepared the way of the kings who (are) from the rising of the sun.

13. And I saw from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the beast of prey, and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.

14. For they are spirits of demons, working signs; they go to the kings of the whole inhabited world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of Aloha the Omnipotent.

15. And BEHOLD, I COME, as the thief. Blessed is he who watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest naked he walk, and they see his shame.

16. And they gathered them to a place which is called in Hebrew Armagedon.

17. And the seventh poured his vial upon the air; and a great voice went forth from the temple, from the throne, saying, IT IS DONE.

18. And there were lightnings and thunders and voices, and a great movement, such as was not since men were upon earth, as this movement so great.

19. And the great city became three parts, and the city of the nations fell; and Babel the great was remembered before Aloha, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.

20. And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.

21. And great hail, as of a talent (in weight), was from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed Aloha from the plague of hail, because the plague thereof was exceeding great.

## Revelation 17

1. AND one of the seven angels who had the seven vials came and spake with me, saying, Come; I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot, which sitteth upon many waters:

2. with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and they who dwell in the earth have been made drunk by the wine of her fornication.

3. And he led me into the desert, in the spirit; and I saw a woman sitting on a beast of prey which was red,Sumoqo. full of names of blasphemy, (and) having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet,Zachurith. and golden with goldMadhabo b'dhabo. and precious stones and pearls; having a cup of gold in her hand, full of pollutions and uncleanness of her fornicationsby which she hath polluted the earth.

5. And upon her forehead the name was written, Mystery: Babel the Great, the Mother of Harlots and of the Abominations of the Earth.

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeshu; and I wondered, when I saw, with great wonder.

7. And the angel said to me, Why wonderest thou? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast of prey which beareth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.

8. The beast of prey which thou seest, was, and is not; and will ascend from the abyss, and go into perdition: and they who dwell on the earth will admire, they whose name is not written in the book of life from the foundations of the world, while they see the beast of prey, who was, and is not, and draweth nigh.

9. Here is the mind of him who hath wisdom: The seven heads are seven hills where the woman sitteth upon them.

10. And the kings are seven; five have fallen, one is, the other not yet hath come: and when he hath come, a little while it behoveth him to abide.

11. And the beast of prey which was and is not, this is an Eighth, and is of the Seven, and is unto perdition.

12. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, the men who kingdom not yet have received; but authority as kings one hour receive with the beast of prey.

13. They have one will, and their power and their authority unto the beast of prey they will give.

14. They with the Lamb will make war, and the Lamb will overcome them; for he is the Lord of lords, and the King of kings, and they who are with him (are) the called and the chosen and the faithful.

15. And he said to me, The waters which thou sawest where the harlot is sitting, are peoples, and assemblages, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast of prey, will hate the harlot, and make her desolate and naked; and her flesh they will eat, and herself burn with fire.

17. For Aloha hath ingiven it to their hands that they might do his will, and perform one will to give their kingdom to the wild beast, until shall be fulfilled the words of Aloha.

18. And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath kingdom over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. AFTER these I saw another angel descending from heaven, having great power; and the earth brightened with his glory.

2. And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen hath Babel the Great, and hath become a den of demons, and the keep of every unclean spirit, and the keep of every unclean and abominable bird, and the keep of every unclean and abominable beast of prey.

3. For that of the wine of her rage have all nations drunk; and the kings of the earth have with her committed fornication, and the merchants of the earth from the power of her luxuriance have become rich.

4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, that you be not partakers of her sins, and lest of her plagues you receive.

5. For her sins have reachedLit. adhered. unto heaven, and Aloha hath remembered her iniquity.

6. Deal with her as she hath dealt with you, and double to her according to her works. In the cup which she mingled mingle to her double.

7. How much she hath pleased herself to be wanton, all this give her suffering and sorrow. For she said in her heart, I sit the queen, and am not a widow, and sorrow I see not.

8. Therefore in one day will come these her plagues, death and sorrow and hunger; and in fire she will burn, for mighty is the Lord God who judgeth her.

9. And the kings of the earth who with her have committed fornication, and have been wanton, shall weep and lament and wail over her, when they see the smoke of her burning;

10. standing from far, for fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, that great city Babel, that mighty city! For in one hour hath come thy judgment.

11. And the merchants of the earth shall be sorrowful over her, because no man buyeth of their burden.

12. No more (shall there be in thee) the burden of gold, and of silver and of precious stones, and of pearls; and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk and scarlet; and of every aromatic wood, and every vessel of elephant's-tooth, and every vessel of wood of great price, and of brass and of iron and of marble;

13. and cinnamon and omomunSpikenard. Gr. text, - which the Syr. retains untranslated. and perfumes, and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil, and fine meal, and wheat, and cattle, and slaves, and horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.

14. And the fruit of the desire of thy soul hath gone from thee, and all those things which are delicious and brilliant have perished from thee,

15. and the merchants of these things will find them no more. They who were made rich by her from afar will stand for fear of her torment, and wail and be sorrowful,

16. saying, Woe, woe, that great city, which was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and golded with gold, and (adorned) with precious stones and pearls;

17. for in one hour hath been destroyed wealth like this. And every captain and every pilot who navigateth to the place, and the mariners, and all who serve on the sea, stood from afar,

18. and cried, while beholding the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like to this great city!

19. And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and lamenting, and saying, Woe, woe, that great city, in which were made rich all they who have ships in the sea, from the preciousness of her! For in one hour she becometh desolate!

20. Rejoice over her, heaven, and the angels and apostles and prophets, because Aloha hath judged your judgment upon her.

21. And an angel took a stone, as a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with force is cast down Babel the great city, and to be found no more.

22. And the voice of harpers, and of musicians, and of singers, and of trumpeters, shall be heard in thee no more. And no artificer, nor art, shall more be found in thee.

23. And the light of a lamp shall be seen in thee no more. And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard in thee no more. For thy merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by thy sorcery were all nations seduced.

24. And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all those who had been killed upon the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. AFTER these I heard a great voice of a multitudinous host in heaven, saying, Halleluia! Salvation, and power, and glory, and honour, Be unto our God.

2. For true and righteous are his judgments; Because he hath judged the great harlot Who corrupted the earth with her fornication, And hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.

3. And the second time they said, Halleluia! And her smoke went up for ever and ever.

4. And the four-and-twenty presbyters fell, and the four living-ones, and worshipped Aloha who sitteth upon the throne, saying, Amen, Halleluia!

5. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all his servants, And they who fear him, small and great.

6. And I heard as the voice of a great host, as the voice of many waters, as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Halleluia, For the Lord our God the Omnipotent reigneth!

7. Let us rejoice and exult and give glory unto him; Because the marriage feast of the Lamb hath come, And his bride hath made herself ready.

8. And it was given to her to be arrayed in fine linen, resplendent and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

9. And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who to the supper of the marriage feast of the Lamb are called. And he said to me, These my words are the true sayings of Aloha.

10. And I fell before his feet to worship; and he said to me, See (that thou do it) not; thy fellowservant (am I), and of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jeshu. Aloha worship; for the testimony of Jeshu is the spirit of prophecy.

11. And I saw heaven opened. And behold a white horse, and he who sat upon him was called the Faithful and the True; and in righteousness he judgeth and maketh war.

12. But his eyes were as the flame of fire, and upon his head were many diadems, having names written; and the name which was written of him no man knoweth but himself.

13. And he was arrayed in a vestment sprinkled with blood, and his name was called The Word of Aloha.

14. And the armies of heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in garments of fine linen, pure (and) white.

15. And from his mouth went forth a sharp sword of two edges, that therewith he might smite the nations. And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron, and he will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Aloha the Omnipotent.

16. And he had upon his vestment and upon his thigh the name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.

17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun. And he cried with a great voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, gather to the great supper of Aloha;

18. that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chiefs of thousands, and the flesh of heroes, and the flesh of horses and them who sit upon them, and the flesh of all the sons of liberty and of the slaves, and of the small and of the great.

19. And I saw the beast of prey, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war with him who sat on the throne, and with his armies.

20. And the beast of prey was taken, and the false prophet with him who wrought signs before him, with which he deluded them who received the signature of the beast of prey, and them who worshipped his image; and living they were both cast into the lake of fire which burneth with sulphur.

21. And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse; with that (sword) which went forth from his mouth. And all the fowls were satiated with their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. AND I saw an angel descending from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he laid hold of the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the deceiver, and Satana, who seduced all the habitable world, and bound him a thousand years;

3. and cast him into the abyss, and shut and sealed over him, that he should no more seduce the nations, until the thousand years be completed: but after them he will be loosed a little time.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them; and to the souls of them who had been cut asunder for the sake of the testimony of Jeshu, and for the word of Aloha, and them who had not worshipped the beast of prey nor his image, nor received his signature upon their forehead and upon their hands. And they lived and reigned with their Meshiha the thousand years.

5. This is the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy is he who hath part in the first resurrection: upon them the second death hath not power; but they shall be priests of Aloha and of his Meshiha, and shall reign with him the thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years shall be fulfilled, Satana will be loosed from the place of his keeping,

8. and will go forth and seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gug and Mogug, to gather them to war, of whom the number is as the sand of the sea.

9. And the accuser who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and of sulphur, as was also the beast of prey and the false prophet; and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

10. And I saw a great white throne, and Him who sat thereon, from whom from his face fled earth and heaven; and place (as) to this was not found for them.

11. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is (the Book) of Life. And the dead were judged from the (records) which are written in the books according to their works.

12. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and shiul gave up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every one according to their works.

13. And death and shiul were cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death.

14. And if a man was not found written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. AND I saw new heavens and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had gone, and the sea was no more.

2. And the holy city, Urishlem the new, I saw descending from heaven from Aloha, prepared as the bride is decked for her husband.

3. And I heard a great voice from heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of Aloha is with men; and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people; and Aloha himself will be with them, and will be their God.

4. And every tear shall be wiped away from their eyes, and death shall be no more; nor sorrow, nor clamour, nor pain, shall be any more; for the former things are passed away.

5. And He who sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said, Write: for these are the faithful and true words of Aloha.

6. And he said to me, I am Olaph and Thau, the Beginning and the End. To him who thirsteth I will give of the water of life freely.

7. He who overcometh shall inherit these; and I will be to him Aloha, and he shall be my son.

8. But the fearful, and the faithless, and sinners, and the unclean, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and servers of idols, and all liars, (shall have) their portion in the lake which burneth with fire and sulphur; which is the second death.

9. And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, came and spake with me. saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.

10. And he led me in spirit upon a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city Urishlem, descending from heaven from Aloha;

11. having the glory of Aloha, as the clearness of light, like a stone of great price, as the stone Jaspon, resembling crystallos;

12. having a wall great and high, which had twelve gates, and names written upon them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations; and upon them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he who talked with me had a measure, a rod of gold, that he might measure the city and the gates and the walls thereof.

16. And the city was set four-square, and the length of it was as the breadth: and he measured the city with the rod, upon twelve stadia of twelve thousand. And the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

17. And he measured the wall of it, an hundred and forty and four measures of the cubits of a man, that is, of the angel.

18. And the structure of the wall of it is (of) jaspis, and the city is of pure gold, like pure brightness.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was of jaspis, the second sathphiros, the third caledon, the fourth zmoragdo,

20. the fifth sardonicos, the sixth sardion, the seventh crisuthilos, the eighth berulla, the ninth topadion, the tenth chrosoposius, the eleventh hyacinthos, the twelfth amuthistos.

21. And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each of every one of the gates (a pearl), and each of every one of the pearls (a gate). And the wide street of the city was of pure gold as the brightness of light.

22. And a temple I saw not in it; for the Lord, the Omnipotent, is the temple thereof and the Lamb.

23. And the city hath no need of the sun nor of the moon to enlighten it; for the glory of Aloha illuminateth it, and the light thereof is the Lamb.

24. And the nations of the saved walk by the light of it, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and the honour of the nations into it.

25. And the gates of it shall not be shut by day, for night is not there.

26. And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it;

27. and nothing shall enter into it that defileth, nor that worketh uncleanness; but they who are written in the book of life of the Lamb.

## Revelation 22

1. AND he showed me a river of waters of life, clear as crystal, coming forth from the throne of Aloha and of the Lamb.

2. In the midst of the wide street of it, and by the river, here and there, (was) the tree of life, which produced twelve fruits, in every month giving each one its fruit. And the leaves of the tree (are) for the healing of the nations.

3. And there shall be no more falling away;Nethro. and the throne of Aloha and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him.

4. And they shall see his face, and his name shall be upon their foreheads.

5. And night shall be no more: nor any need have they of the light of a lamp, or the light of the sun; for the Lord God enlighteneth them, and they will reign for ever and ever.

6. And he said to me, These sayings are faithfulness and truth. And the Lord God of the spirit of the prophets hath sent me, his angel, to show to his servants the things which must soon be done.

7. And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.Polyglot, "Of this prophecy."

8. And also I Juhanon am he who heard and saw these. And when I had heard and seen, I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed them to me.

9. And he said to me, See (that thou do it) not. I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the words of this book. Worship Aloha.

10. And he said to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time draweth nigh.

11. He who doeth evil shall work evil still; and he who is filthy shall be filthy still; and the righteous shall still do righteousness, and the holy be holy still.

12. Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to every one according as is his work.

13. I am Olaph and Thau, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.

14. Blessed are they who do his commandments, that they may have authority to the tree of life, and by the gates may enter into the city.

15. Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and servers of idols, and every one who loveth and maketh a lie.

16. I JESHU have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things before the churches. I am the root and the offspring of Dawid, as the bright, the morning star.

17. AND THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY, COME! AND HE WHO HEARETH SHALL SAY, COME! AND HE WHO THIRSTETH MAY COME, AND HE WHO WILLETH, TO TAKE THE WATERS OF LIFE FREELY.

18. I testify to every one who heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, That if any man shall set upon them, Aloha will set upon him the plagues which are written in this book.

19. And if any man make to cease from the words of the book of this prophecy, Aloha will make to cease his portion of the tree of life, and of the holy city of which is written in this book.

20. He who testifieth these saith, Yes: I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jeshu.

21. The grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha be with all the saints. Amen.
