# 2 John

## 2 John 1

1. THE presbyter to the elect Kuria and to her sons, whom I love in truth, nor I only, but all they who know the truth,

2. on account of the truth which abideth in us, and is with us for ever;

3. Grace be with you and mercy and peace, from Aloha the Father, and from Jeshu Meshiha the Son of the Father, in truth and in love.

4. I have rejoiced much to have found of thy sons who walk in the truth, after the commandment we have received from the Father.

5. And now I entreat thee, Kuria,-no new commandment writing to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning,-that we love one another.

6. And this is love, that we walk according to the commandment; this commandment is according to that which you have heard from the beginning, that in it we should walk.

7. Because many deceivers are come out into the world who confess not that Jeshu Meshiha came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and antichrist.

8. Be watchful of yourselves, that not any thing perish which you have wrought; but (that with) a complete reward you may be recompensed.

9. Every one who transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of the Meshiha, hath not Aloha.

10. If any one come to you, and this doctrine bring not, receive him not into the house, and "Joy to you," and " Farewell," say not to him.

11. For he who saith to him, " Farewell," becometh a participator of his evil deeds.

12. Though I have many things to write to you, I will not with parchment and ink; but I hope to come to you, and mouth with mouth to speak, that our joy may be complete.

13. The sons of thy elect sister ask your peace. Grace be with you. Amen.
