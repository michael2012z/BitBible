## 1 John 1

1. WE announce

2. And the life was manifested, and we have seen, and testify, and preach to you the eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested to us.

3. And what we have seen and heard, we make known also to you, that you may have communion with us; and our communion is with the Father, and with his Son Jeshu the Meshiha.

4. And these write we unto you, that our joy which is in you may be complete.

5. And this is the annunciation which we have heard from him, and announce to you, that Aloha is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

6. And if we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and in the truth do not proceed;

7. but if in the light we walk, as He is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jeshu his Son cleanseth us from all our sins.

8. And if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us;

9. but if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

10. And if we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

## 1 John 2

1. My sons, these write I to you, that you sin not. And if a man shall sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeshu Meshiha, the Just;

2. for he is the propitiation for our sins, and not on behalf of ours only, but also on behalf of the whole world.

3. And by this we feel that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

4. For he who saith that he knoweth him, and his commandments keepeth not, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

5. But he who keepeth his word, in him is perfected truly the love of Aloha; for by this we know that we are in him.

6. He who saith, I am in him, ought according to his walkings to walk.

7. MY beloved, a new commandment I write not to you, but the old commandment, that which was with you from the beginning; but the old commandment is the word which you have heard.

8. Again, a new commandment I write to you, that which is true in him and in you; because the darkness hath passed, and the true light beginneth to appear.

9. Whoever saith, then, that he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.

10. He who loveth his brother, in the light abideth, and offence is not in him.

11. He who hateth his brother is in darkness, and in the darkness walketh, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness itself hath blinded his eyes.

12. I write to you, sons,

13. I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who hath been from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked. I have written to you, children,

14. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who (hath been) from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of Aloha remaineth in you, and you have overcome the wicked.

15. Love not the world, nor any thing which is in it; for whoever loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

16. For every thing that is in the world, is the lust of the body, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of the world. These which are not of the Father, but they are from the world itself.

17. And the world passeth, (both) it and its lusts; but he who doeth the will of Aloha, continueth for ever.

18. my sons, it is the last time: and as you have heard, the false meshiha cometh; and now there are many false meshihas, and from this we know that it is the last time.

19. From us they went forth, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, with us would they have remained. But they went forth from us, that it might be known that they were not of us.

20. And you have an anointing from the Holy, and you discern every man.

21. I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but you know it, and that no lie is of it, of the truth.

22. Who is a liar, if not he who denieth that Jeshu is the Meshiha? and this (one) is a false meshiha. He who denieth the Father, denieth also the Son;

23. and he who denieth the Son, disbelieveth also the Father. Whoso confesseth the Son, the Father also confesseth.

24. And you, what you have heard from the first, let it continue with you. For, if what you have heard from the first continue with you, you also will continue in the Father and in the Son.

25. And this is the promise which he promised to us, eternal life.

26. But these I have written to you, because of those who would seduce you.

27. And you, also, if the anointing continue with you which you have received from him, have not need that a man should teach you; but as the anointing that is from Aloha itself teacheth you concerning every thing, and is true, neither is falsity in it; and as it hath taught you, continue in it.

28. And now, my sons, continue in him: that when he is manifested we may not he confounded of him, but we may have confidence at his coming.

29. If you know that he is righteous, know also that every one who doeth righteousness is of him.

## 1 John 3

1. And see how great is the love of the Father toward us, that sons he hath called us, and also made us! Therefore the world doth not know us, because that it hath also not known him.

2. MY beloved, now are we the sons of Aloha; and it is not manifest, as yet, what we are to become, but we know, that when he is manifested, in his likeness we are and see him, according to that which he is.

3. And every one who hath in him this hope, purifieth himself, as He is pure.

4. But whoever committeth sin doeth iniquity; for all sin is iniquity.

5. And you know that he was manifested to bear our sins, and sin in him is not.

6. And every one who in him abideth, sinneth not. And every one who sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him.

7. My sons, let no man deceive you: he who worketh righteousness is righteous, as also the Meshiha himself is righteous.

8. And he who doeth sin is of Satana, because that from the commencement Satana was a sinner. And for this cause did the Son of Aloha appear, that he might destroy the works of Satana.

9. Every one who is born of Aloha, sin doth not work, because that his seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because of Aloha he is born.

10. In this are distinguished the sons of Aloha from the sons of Satana; every one who doeth not righteousness, nor loveth his brother, is not of Aloha.

11. For this is the commandment which you have heard from before, that you love one another.

12. Not as Koen, who was from the Evil, and killed his brother. And on what account killed he him? unless that his own works were evil and his brother's righteous.

13. Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world hate you.

14. We know that we have passed from death unto life, by this, that we love our brethren. He who loveth not his brother, in death continueth.

15. For every one who hateth his brother is a man-killer; and we know that in no man-killer can abide the life which is eternal.

16. In this we know His love toward us, that he gave himself for us; (so) also it is right for us for the sake of our brethren to give ourselves.

17. And he who hath the possession of the world, and shall see his brother that he needeth, and shall shut his compassions from him, how is there in him the love of Aloha?

18. My sons, let us not love one another in words and in tongue, but in works and in truth.

19. And by this we make known that we are of the truth, and before that he cometh we make confident our hearts.

20. And if our heart condemn us, how much (more) Aloha, who is greater than our heart, and knoweth every thing!

21. My beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have openness of face before Aloha.

22. And whatever we ask, we shall receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things which are beautiful

23. And this is his commandment, That we believe in the name of his Son Jeshu Meshiha, and love one another, as he hath commanded us.

24. And he who keepeth his commandments, is kept by him, and he dwelleth in him: and by this we perceive that he dwelleth in us, by his Spirit whom

## 1 John 4

1. MY beloved, believe not all spirits, but discern the spirits whether they be from Aloha; because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.

2. By this we know the Spirit of Aloha: Every spirit who confesseth that Jeshu Meshiha hath come in the flesh, is from Aloha.

3. And every spirit who confesseth not that Jeshu hath come in the flesh, is not from Aloha: but this is from that false meshiha, of whom you have heard that he cometh, and now is in the world already.

4. But you of Aloha are the children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is with you, than he who is in the world.

5. And these are of the world, therefore the world heareth them. But we are of Aloha; and he who knoweth Aloha heareth us;

6. and he who is not of Aloha heareth us not. In this itself we perceive the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.

7. my beloved, let us love one another, because love is of Aloha; and every one who loveth from Aloha is born, and knoweth Aloha.

8. For Aloha is Love; and every one who loveth not, knoweth not Aloha.

9. In this was made known the love of Aloha towards us, that Aloha sent his only Son into the world that we might live by him.

10. In this is love: it was not that we had loved Aloha, but that Aloha himself loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.

11. MY beloved, if Aloha so hath loved us, we also are indebted to love one another.

12. Aloha no man hath seen but if we love one another, Aloha in us abideth, and his love is fulfilled in us.

13. And by this we know that in him we abide, and he abideth in us, because of his Spirit he hath given us.

14. And we have seen and we testify that the Father hath sent his Son, the Redeemer of the world.

15. Whosoever confesseth Jeshu that he is the Son of Aloha, in him Aloha abideth, and he abideth in Aloha.

16. And we have believed and known the love which Aloha hath toward us; for Aloha is Love. And every one who abideth in love in Aloha abideth.

17. And in this is his love perfected with us, that openness of face we might have in the day of judgment; because that as He was, so also we are in this world.

18. Fear in love is not: but perfect love hath cast out fear, because fear is in terror.

19. We then will love Aloha, because he hath first loved us.

20. But if one shall say, I love Aloha, and his brother he hateth, he is a liar. For he who his brother whom he hath seen loveth not, how can he love Aloha himself whom he hath not seen?

21. And this commandment we have received from him, That every one who loveth Aloha shall love also his brother.

## 1 John 5

1. WHOSOEVER believeth that Jeshu is the Meshiha of Aloha is born. And every one who loveth the Generator loveth also him who is generated of him.

2. And by this we know that we love the children of Aloha, when we love Aloha, and work his commandments.

3. For this is the love of Aloha, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not heavy.

4. Because every one who is born of Aloha overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.

5. For who (is he) that overcometh the world, but he who believeth that Jeshu is the Son of Aloha?

6. This is he who came by water and blood, Jeshu the Meshiha: it was not by water only, but by water and blood; and the Spirit testifieth, because the Spirit himself is truth.

7. And there are three that testify, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood;

8. and these three are in one.

9. If the testimony of men we receive, how much greater is the testimony of Aloha? and this is the testimony which Aloha hath testified concerning his Son.

10. Whosoever believeth in the Son of Aloha hath this testimony in himself. Every one who believeth not Aloha hath made him a liar, in not believing the testimony that he hath testified concerning his Son.

11. And this is the testimony, That the life which is eternal, Aloha hath given to us, and this life is in his Son.

12. Every one who apprehendeth

13. These I have written to you, that you may know that you have the life which is eternal, who believe in the name of the Son of Aloha.

14. And this is the assurance that we have toward him, that all that we ask of him according to his will, he heareth us.

15. And if we are persuaded that he heareth us concerning what we ask from him, we are confident of receiving already the requests that we ask from him.

16. if a man shall see his brother sin a sin not obnoxious to the death, he shall ask, and life be given to him, to those who sin not as unto the death. For there is the sin of death;-it is not concerning this I say that a man shall pray.

17. For all iniquity is sin; and there is sin which is not of death.

18. And we know that every one who is born of Aloha sinneth not. For he who is born of Aloha keepeth himself, and the Evil doth not approach him.

19. We know that we are of Aloha, and the whole world in the Evil is lying.

20. And we know that the Son of Aloha hath come, and hath given us knowledge to know the truth, and to be in him in the truth, in his Son Jeshu the Meshiha. This is Aloha the true, and the life which is eternal.

21. My sons, keep yourselves from the service of idols.
