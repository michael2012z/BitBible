# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. PAULOS and Timotheus, servants of Jeshu the Meshiha, to all the saints who are in Jeshu Meshiha at Philipos, with the presbyters and deacons.

2. Grace be with you and peace from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

3. I offer thanks unto Aloha upon the remembrance of you constantly,

4. in all my prayers on your behalf; and while rejoicing,

5. I pray, for your fellowship which is in the gospel from the first day until now;

6. because I am confident of this, that he who hath begun good workings in you will himself make perfect until the day of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

7. For so it is right for me to think concerning you all, because you are laid up in my heart; and in my bonds, and in the defence of the truth of the gospel, you are partakers with me in grace.

8. For Aloha is my witness how I love you with the bowels of Jeshu Meshiha.

9. And this I pray, that your love may still increase and abound in knowledge and in all spiritual understanding;

10. that you may distinguish those things that are proper, and may be pure and without offence in the day of the Meshiha,

11. and filled with the fruits of righteousness which are in Jeshu Meshiha, to the glory and the honour of Aloha.

12. BUT I wish you to know, my brethren, that my business tendeth the more to the forwarding of the gospel.

13. For so also my bonds are manifest for the Meshiha in the whole palace,

14. And a multitude of brethren who are in our Lord are strengthened on account of my bonds, and have dared the more fearlessly to speak the word of Aloha.

15. Some preach from envy and contention, but some from good-will,

16. and in the love of the Meshiha; for they know that for the defence of the gospel I am appointed.

17. But those who preach the Meshiha from contention do it not sincerely,

18. Yet in this I have rejoiced, and do rejoice, that in every way, if for an occasion, or if in truth, the Meshiha shall be preached.

19. For I know that these things shall be found unto my life by your prayers, and by the gift of the Spirit of Jeshu Meshiha;

20. even as I hope and expect, that in nothing I shall be confounded, but manifestly, as at all times, so also now, the Meshiha shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.

21. For my life is the Meshiha; and if I die, it is gain to me.

22. But if in this life of the flesh there be also fruit to me from my works, I know not what to choose.

23. For these two straiten me. I desire to be set free, that I might be with the Meshiha, and this is greatly preferable

24. but also to remain in my body is the thing which constraineth me on your account.

25. For I know this confidently, that I am to remain and tarry for your joy and for the increase of your faith:

26. that when I come again to you, your glorying which is in Jeshu Meshiha alone shall abound in me.

27. As it becometh the gospel of the Meshiha, so have your conversation; that if coming I see you, or absent, I may hear of you, that you stand in one spirit and in one soul, conquering together for the faith of the gospel;

28. in nothing moved by them who stand against us, to the forthshowing of their perdition, and of our salvation,

29. And this from Aloha hath been given to you, not only believing to believe in the Meshiha, but also for his sake to suffer,

30. and to sustain a conflict, as you have seen in me, and now hear concerning me.

## Philippians 2

1. IF, therefore, you have consolation in the Meshiha, and if there be comfort in love,

2. complete my gladness by having one sentiment and one love, and one soul and one mind.

3. And do nothing in contention or vainglorying, but in meekness of mind let a man consider his neighbour as better than himself.

4. And let no one care for himself (only), but every one for his neighbour also.

5. And feel

6. who, when he was in the form of Aloha, considered this not to be robbery, (this, namely,) that he was the co-equal of Aloha:

7. yet emptied he himself, and took the form of a servant, and was made in the form of men;

8. and in fashion was found as a man, and humbled himself, and was obedient unto death, but the death of the cross.

9. Wherefore also Aloha greatly exalted him, and gave him a name that is more excellent than all names,

10. that at the name of Jeshu every knee should kneel, of those in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;

11. and that every tongue should confess that Jeshu the Meshiha is the Lord, to the glory of Aloha his Father.

12. WHEREFORE, my beloved, as you have all time obeyed, not while I am near you only, but now that I am far from you, the more with fear and trembling work the work of your salvation;

13. for Aloha himself effectuates

14. Do every thing without murmuring and without division;

15. that you may be perfect and without spot, as the pure children of Aloha, who dwell in a generation depraved and perverse; and be manifest among them as luminaries in the world,

16. to be unto them for a place of salvation, for my exultation in the day of the Meshiha, that I may not have run in vain, nor laboured to no purpose.

17. But, also,

18. so also you be glad and rejoice with me.

19. But I hope in our Lord Jeshu to send Timotheos to you soon, that I also may have quietness when I learn concerning you.

20. For I have no other who is so as my (own) soul, who will diligently take care for yours.

21. For all are seeking what is theirs, and not what is of Jeshu Meshiha.

22. But the proof of this

23. Him, therefore, I hope to send to you speedily, when I shall have seen what

24. And I confide on my Lord, that I also speedily shall come unto you.

25. But now the matter hath pressed me to send to you the brother Epaphroditos, who is a helper and labourer with me, but your messenger and minister to my necessity;

26. for he desired to see you all, and was anxious, because he knew that you had heard that he was sick.

27. Yes, he was sick, unto death; but Aloha had mercy upon him; but not upon him only, but upon me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

28. Urgently, therefore, have I sent him to you, that when you have seen him again you may rejoice, and that I may have a little breathing.

29. Receive him, then, in the Lord with all joy; and those who are such, hold in estimation:

30. because for the work of the Meshiha he had come nigh unto death, and was disregardful of his life, that he might accomplish that which you had wanted in the service which concerned me.

## Philippians 3

1. HENCEFORTH, my brethren, rejoice in our Lord. To write the very same (things) to you, to me is not weariness, because they make you

2. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the cutting of the flesh.

3. For the circumcision are we, who serve Aloha in the spirit, and glory in Jeshu the Meshiha, and confide not on the flesh.

4. Yet I may have confidence on the flesh. For if any one consider that his confidence is in the flesh, I

5. Circumcised the son of eight days, of the family of Israel, of the tribe of Benyomin, Ebroia of Ebroyee; in the law, Pharisha;

6. in zeal, a persecutor of the church; and in the righteousness of the law, without fault have I been.

7. But these things which were my gain, I have reckoned loss for the Meshiha;

8. and I also (still) reckon them all loss, for the grandeur

9. and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of the Meshiha, which is righteousness that is from Aloha:

10. that in it I may know Jeshu, and the power of his resurrection, and have fellowship in his sufferings, and be conformed into his death,

11. that any how

12. I have not yet received, nor (am I) yet perfected; but I run, that so I may lay hold on that for the sake of which Jeshu the Meshiha hath laid hold on me.

13. MY brethren, I think not concerning myself that I have laid hold (of the final prize); but one (thing) I know, that what is behind me I forget, and to that which is before me

14. I stretch, and run towards the sign, to obtain the victory of the high vocation of Aloha by Jeshu Meshiha.

15. Let those, then, who are mature consider these things; and if otherwise you consider, this also will Aloha reveal to you.

16. Nevertheless, that to this we may attain, in one way let us proceed, and with one consent.

17. Be like me, my brethren, and consider them who so walk according to the pattern you have seen in us.

18. For there are many who walk otherwise, of whom many times I have told you, but now weeping I tell you, they are adversaries of the cross of the Meshiha;

19. they, whose end is perdition, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is their shame; they, whose mind is in the earth.

20. But our employment

21. who will change the body of our abasement to make (it) in the fashion of his glorious body,

## Philippians 4

1. Wherefore, my brethren, beloved and tenderly-regarded, my joy and my crown, so stand in our Lord, my beloved.

2. Of Evhodia I beseech, and of Syntika, that one mind they have in our Lord.

3. Also of thee I beseech, my true yokefellow, to be helpful to those who are labouring with me in the gospel, with Klimis, and with the rest of my helpers, whose names are written in the book of life.

4. Rejoice in our Lord in all time, and again I say, Rejoice.

5. And let your meekness be known unto every man: our Lord is near.

6. For nothing be anxious; but in all time, with prayer and with supplication, let your requests be made known before Aloha:

7. And the peace of Aloha, which is greater than all knowledge, shall keep your hearts and your minds, through Jeshu Meshiha.

8. FINALLY, my brethren, those (things) which are true, and those which are honest, and those which are just, and those which are pure, and those which are lovely, and those which are laudable, and those (which are) works of praise and of celebration, these consider.

9. These which you have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these perform; and the God of peace will be with you.

10. But greatly do I rejoice in our Lord, that you have begun to care (again) for me, as also you were

11. But I have not spoken because I have had need; for I have learned to make sufficient to me that which I have had.

12. I know (how) to be abased, I know also how to abound in all; and in every thing I am trained with sufficiency and with hunger, with abundance and with destitution

13. for every thing I am empowered through the Meshiha who strengtheneth me.

14. Nevertheless, you have done well to communicate unto my afflictions.

15. Know also, you Philipisoyee, that in the commencement of the gospel, when I went forth from Makedunia, not one of the churches communicated to me in the account of receiving and giving, but you only.

16. For also to Thessalonika one time and twice to my necessity you sent.

17. Not because I seek the gift, but I seek that fruit may multiply unto you.

18. But I have received every thing, I abound; and am full; and I have accepted all that you sent me by Epaphroditos, a sweet fragrance and a sacrifice, acceptable, which pleaseth Aloha.

19. And my God shall supply all your necessity, according to his riches in the glory of Jeshu Meshiha.

20. To Aloha our Father be praise and glory to the age of ages. Amen.

21. Ask for the peace of all the saints who are in Jeshu the Meshiha. The brethren who are with me ask for your peace.

22. All the saints ask for your peace, especially those who are of the house of Caesar.

23. The grace of our Lord Jeshu the Meshiha be with you all. Amen.
