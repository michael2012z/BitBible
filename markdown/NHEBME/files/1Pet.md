# 1 Peter

## 1 Peter 1

1. Peter, an apostle of Yeshua the Messiah, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Diaspora in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

2. according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Yeshua the Messiah and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Yeshua the Messiah from the dead,

4. to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,

5. who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

6. Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,

7. that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Yeshua the Messiah-

8. whom not having seenNU Vg. M reads "known" instead of "seen" you love; in whom, though now you do not see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory-

9. receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

10. Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,

11. searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Messiah, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Messiah, and the glories that would follow them.

12. To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into. 

13. Therefore, prepare your minds for action,literally, "gird up the waist of your mind" be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Yeshua the Messiah-

14. as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,

15. but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;

16. because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I am holy."NU Vg. M reads "Be becoming holy" instead of "You shall be holy"Leviticus 11:44-45

17. If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:

18. knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,

19. but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Messiah;

20. who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,

21. who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead, and gave Him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God. 

22. Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truthNU Vg. M TR add "through the Spirit" in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from a pure heart fervently:

23. having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding Word of God.M TR add "forever," reading "through the Word of God, which lives and remains forever" instead of "through the living and abiding Word of God"

24. For, "All flesh is like grass, and all it'sNU Vg. M TR read "of man's" instead of "it's" glory like the flower in the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls;

25. but the word of the Lord endures forever."Isaiah 40:6-8 This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.  

## 1 Peter 2

1. Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,

2. as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,

3. if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:

4. coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.

5. You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Yeshua the Messiah.

6. Because it is contained inM TR add "the" Scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed."Isaiah 28:16 

7. For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who do not believeNU Vg. M TR read "are disobedient" instead of "do not believe", "The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,"Psalm 118:22 

8. and, "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense."Isaiah 8:14 For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.

9. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:

10. who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

11. Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

12. having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.

13. M TR add "Therefore"Subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;

14. or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.

15. For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:

16. as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God. 

17. Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.

18. Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.

19. For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.

20. For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.

21. For to this you were called, because Messiah also suffered for youTR reads "us" instead of "you", leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,

22. who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."Isaiah 53:9

23. Who, when he was cursed, did not curse back. When he suffered, did not threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;

24. who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by hisM TR read "whose" instead of "his" stripes you were healed.

25. For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer"Overseer" is from the Greek episkopon, which can mean overseer, curator, guardian, or superintendent of your souls.  

## 1 Peter 3

1. In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any do not obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;

2. seeing your pure behavior in fear.

3. Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;

4. but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious.

5. For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:

6. as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. 

7. You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered. 

8. Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humbleNU Vg. M TR read "courteous" instead of "humble",

9. not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; becauseM TR read "knowing that" instead of "because" to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.

10. For, "He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.

11. Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.

12. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."Psalm 34:12-16 

13. Now who is he who will harm you, if you become zealousNU Vg. M TR read "imitators" instead of "zealous" of that which is good?

14. But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear, neither be troubled."Isaiah 8:12

15. But sanctify in your hearts Messiah as LordNU Vg. M TR read "the Lord God in your hearts" instead of "in your hearts Messiah as Lord"; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yetNU Vg. M TR omit "yet" with humility and fear:

16. having a good conscience; so that when they speak evil against you, they may be put to shame who slander your good manner of life in Messiah. 

17. For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.

18. Because Messiah also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;

19. in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,

20. who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.

21. This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Yeshua the Messiah,

22. who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.  

## 1 Peter 4

1. Forasmuch then as Messiah sufferedNU Vg. M adds "for you" in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;

2. that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.

3. For enough time in the past has been spentNU Vg. M TR read "lifetime" instead of "time" doing the will of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.

4. They think it is strange that you do not run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:

5. who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

6. For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.

7. But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober inNU Vg. M TR add "your" prayer.

8. M TR add "And"Above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for loveNU Vg. M TR add "will" covers a multitude of sins.

9. Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.

10. As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.

11. If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength whichM reads "as" instead of "which" God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Yeshua the Messiah, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. 

12. Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.

13. But because you are partakers of Messiah's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.

14. If you are insulted for the name of Messiah, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.NU (Vg). M TR add "On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified"

15. For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.

16. But if one of you suffers for being a ChristianOr, "follower of Messiah," "follower of Messiah", let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this nameNU Vg. M TR read "matter" instead of "name".

17. For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who do not obey the Good News of God?

18. "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?"Proverbs 11:31

19. Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.  

## 1 Peter 5

1. ThereforeM TR omit "Therefore", I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Messiah, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.

2. Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to GodNU Vg. M TR omit "according to God"; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;

3. neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.

4. When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away. 

5. Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of youNU Vg. M TR add "be subjected to one another" clothe yourselves with humility, towards one another; for "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."Proverbs 3:34

6. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;

7. casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you. 

8. Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

9. Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.

10. And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in MessiahM TR add "Yeshua", after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen and establish you.

11. To him be theM TR add "glory and the" power foreverM TR add "and ever". Amen. 

12. Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!M TR read "in which you stand" instead of "Stand firm in it"

13. She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.

14. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Messiah.M TR add "Yeshua. Amen"
