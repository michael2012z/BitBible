# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the commandment of life which is in Christ Jesus,

2. to Timothy, my beloved child. Grace, mercy, peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

3. I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my ancestors with a clean conscience, as I have incessant mention of you in my prayers, night and day

4. longing to see you, remembering your tears, in order that I may be filled with joy;

5. having received the remembrance of the unhypocritical faith which is in you; which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded that it is in you also.

6. On account of which cause I remind you to revive and refire the gift of God which is in you by the laying on of my hands.

7. For God has not given us the spirit of cowardice; but of power and divine love and prudence.

8. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor me his prisoner: but suffer affliction for the sake of the gospel according to the power of God;

9. the one having saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the eternal times,

10. but now having been made manifest through the appearing of Jesus Christ our Saviour, the one having indeed destroyed death, and lighted up life and immortality through the gospel,

11. unto which I have been placed a herald, and an apostle, and teacher:

12. on account of which cause I indeed suffer these things: but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to stand guard over that which is committed unto me unto that day.

13. Hold fast the form of sound words which you heard with me, in the faith and divine love which is in Christ Jesus:

14. stand guard over the beautiful deposit through the Holy Ghost who dwells in us.

15. You know this, that all who are in Asia, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes have turned away from me.

16. May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because frequently he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,

17. and, being in Rome, he diligently sought me, and found me.

18. May the Lord grant unto him to find mercy with the Lord in that day. And so many things as he ministered in Ephesus, you know better. 

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Therefore, my child, be thou filled up with dynamite in the grace which is in Christ Jesus,

2. and whatsoever things thou hast heard with me through many witnesses, commit thou the same to faithful men, who will be able also to teach others.

3. Suffer affliction, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

4. No one operating as a soldier is entangled with the affairs of life; in order that he may please his commander.

5. But if indeed any one may fight, he is not crowned unless he may fight lawfully.

6. It behooves the toiling farmer first to partake of the fruits.

7. Know what I say; for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ, who is risen from the dead, from the seed of David, according to my gospel:

9. in whom I suffer affliction as an evil-doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

10. On account of this I endure all things for the sake of the elect, in order that they may also have the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

11. It is a faithful saying: For if we die along with him, we will also live with him:

12. if we endure, we will truly reign with him: if we shall deny him, he will also deny us:

13. if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful; for he is not able to deny himself.

14. Remember these things, testifying before God, that they shall not fight with words, profitable unto nothing, for the overturning of those who hear.

15. Study to present yourself to God approved, a workman not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

16. But reject the unsanctified empty talks: for they will proceed unto more of ungodliness,

17. and their word like gangrene will have eating. Of whom are Hymenaeus and Phyletus;

18. who have made shipwreck concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already come, and they overturn the faith of some.

19. The foundation of God stands solid indeed, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his: and; Let every one naming the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.

20. But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and stone, the former truly indeed unto honor, but the latter unto dishonor.

21. Therefore if any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, having been sanctified, well pleasing to the Lord, having been prepared unto every good work.

22. But fly from youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, divine love, peace, with those who call upon the Lord out of a clean heart.

23. But reject foolish and undisciplinary questions, knowing that they gender strife.

24. But it does not behoove the servant of the Lord to strive, but to be gentle toward all, competent to teach, enduring evil,

25. in meekness correcting the adversaries; if peradventure God may grant unto them repentance into the perfect knowledge of the truth,

26. and they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him (the Lord's servant) according to his will. 

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But know this, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2. For men will be lovers of themselves, moneylovers, arrogant, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,

3. without natural affections, covenant breakers, devilish, intemperate, furious, opposed to good,

4. traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;

5. having a form of godliness, but denying the power of the same: and from these turn away.

6. For of these are those creeping into houses, and leading captive little, silly women laden with sins, being led by divers lusts,

7. always learning, and never able to come into the perfect knowledge of the truth.

8. In the manner in which Jannes and Jambres also resisted Moses, so these indeed resist the truth; men who are corrupt as to their mind, reprobate concerning the faith.

9. But they shall proceed no further: for their insanity will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.

10. Burt you have followed my teaching, leadership, purpose, faith, long suffering, divine love, patience,

11. persecutions, sufferings; such as came to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; such persecutions as I endured: and the Lord delivered me out of them all.

12. But truly all wishing to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

13. But wicked men and seducers will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

14. But abide thou in those things which thou hast learned and in which thou hast been instructed, knowing from whom thou hast learned;

15. and that from an infant thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

16. All scripture is God-breathed and profitable unto teaching, unto conviction, unto correction, unto instruction which is in righteousness:

17. in order that the man of God may be perfect, having been thoroughly perfected unto every good work. 

## 2 Timothy 4

1. In the presence of God, and Jesus Christ, the one about to judge the living and the dead, I testify to, both his appearing and his kingdom;

2. preach the word: be instant in season and out of season; convict, exhort, rebuke, with all longsuffering and teaching.

3. For the time will come when they will not endure healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap to themselves teachers itching as to their hearing;

4. and they will indeed turn their hearing from the truth, and be turned unto fables.

5. But be thou sober in all things, suffer affliction, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

6. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.

7. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:

8. finally there is a crown of righteousness laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me in that day: not only to me, but to all those who with divine love, do love his appearing.

9. Hasten to come to me quickly.

10. For Demas has left me, having loved the present age, and is gone into Thessalonica; Crescents into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.

11. Luke alone is with me. Having taken Mark, bring him with you: for he is useful unto me for the ministry.

12. But I sent Tychicus into Ephesus.

13. Coming, bring the cloak, which I left in Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith showed to me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works.

15. Whom you also watch for he resisted our words exceedingly.

16. In my first defence no one stood by me, but all left me: may it not be charged against them:

17. but the Lord stood by me, and impowered me; in order that the preaching through me might be fulfilled, and all the Gentiles hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

18. And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and save me into his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.

19. Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus remained in Corinth: and I left Trophimus in Miletum sick.

21. Hasten to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers salute you.

22. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
