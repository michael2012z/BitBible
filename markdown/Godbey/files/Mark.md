# Mark

## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

2. As has been written in the prophets; Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee;

3. the voice of one roaring in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.

4. John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness the baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins.

5. And all the Judean country and the Jerusalemites were going out unto him, and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

6. And John was clothed with camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, and eating locusts and wild honey;

7. And he proclaimed, saying, I indeed baptized you with water; but One cometh after me more powerful than I; the latchet of His sandals I am not worthy, having stooped down, to loose,

8. and He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.

9. And it came to pass in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

10. And coming up straightway from the water, He saw the heavens open and the Spirit like a dove descending on Him.

11. And there was a voice from the heavens: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I delight.

12. And immediately the Spirit casts Him out into the wilderness.

13. And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels continued to minister unto Him.

14. After that John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

15. and saying, That the time is fulfilled: the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.

16. And walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting their net in the sea: for they were fishers.

17. Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.

18. And immediately, having left their nets, they followed Him.

19. And going forth thence a little, He saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, themselves also in a ship mending their nets,

20. and immediately He called them. And having left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired hands, they departed after Him.

21. And they come into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath, He was teaching in the synagogue.

22. And they were astonished at His teaching; for Ile was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

23. And there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

24. saying, Let me alone; what is there to us and thee, thou Jesus, the Nazarene? You have come to destroy us; I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out from him.

26. And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a great voice, came out from him.

27. And they were all astonished, so that they were inquiring one to another, saying, What is this? what new teaching is this? Because according to authority He commands the unclean spirits, and they obey Him;

28. and His fame went out immediately into all the surrounding country of Galilee.

29. And immediately, having come out from the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

30. And the mother-in-law of Simon was lying down burning with fever; and immediately they speak to Him concerning her:

31. And having come to her, taking her by the hand, He raised her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she continued to minister unto them.

32. And it being evening, when the sun went down, they were carrying to Him all the sick and demonized;

33. and the whole city was gathered to the door.

34. And He healed many who were afflicted with various diseases, and He cast out many demons; and did not suffer the demons to speak, because they knew Him.

35. And in the morning, exceedingly early, while it was yet night, having arisen up He came out, and went away into a desert place, and was praying there.

36. And Simon and those who were with him followed Him.

37. And they found Him, and say to Him, All are seeking after thee.

38. And He says to them, Let us go into the surrounding villages and cities, that I may preach there; for unto this I have come out.

39. And He was preaching in their synagogues in all Galilee, and casting out the demons.

40. And a leper comes to Him, entreating Him, and bowing the knee to Him, and saying to Him, That if thou mayest be willing, thou art able to cleanse me.

41. And Jesus being moved with compassion, reaching forth His hand, touched him, and says to him, I will; be thou cleansed.

42. And He speaking, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

43. And charging him, He immediately sent him away,

44. and says to him, See that you may speak nothing to any one: but go, show thyself unto the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

45. And he having gone out, began to proclaim many things, and to publish abroad the word, so that He was no longer able openly to come into the city, but was out in desert places: and they continued to come to Him from all directions. 

## Mark 2

1. And again He having come into Capernaum during those days; and it was heard that He was in the house.

2. And immediately many were assembled together, so that there was no room, even at the door; and He was speaking the word to them.

3. And they come to Him, carrying a paralytic, borne by four.

4. And not being able to come near Him on account of the crowd, they opened the roof where He was: and having lifted it up, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.

5. And Jesus seeing their faith says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven thee.

6. And certain ones of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,

7. Why does He speak blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except the one God?

8. And Jesus immediately knowing in His spirit that they are thus reasoning among themselves, said to them, Why do you thus reason in your hearts?

9. Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take thy bed, and walk about?

10. But in order that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins

11. (He says to the paralytic), I say unto thee, Arise, take thy bed, and go into thy house.

12. And he arose immediately, and having taken the bed, went out before them all. So that all were astonished, and glorified God, saying, Never have we seen it after this sort.

13. And He came out again by the sea; and the whole multitude came to Him, and He was teaching them.

14. And passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus sitting at the toll, and says to him, Follow me. And rising up, he followed Him.

15. And it came to pass, while He was sitting at the table in his house, and many publicans and sinners were sitting along with Jesus and his disciples: for they were many, and they followed Him.

16. And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing Him eating with the publicans and sinners, were saying to His disciples, Why does He eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

17. Jesus hearing, says to them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

18. The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to Him; Wherefore do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples do not fast?

19. And Jesus said to them, Whether are the sons of the bride-chamber able to fast while the bridegroom is with them? So long a time as they have with them the bridegroom they are not able to fast.

20. But the days will come, when the bridegroom must be taken from them, and then they will fast in that day.

21. No one putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: lest the new take its fullness from the old, and the rent is made worse.

22. No one puts new wine in old bottles: lest the new wine shall break the bottles, and the wine is poured out, and the bottles shall perish: but the new wine is put in new bottles.

23. And it came to pass, that He was traveling through the corn-fields on the Sabbath-day; and His disciples began to make the journey plucking the ears.

24. And the Pharisees continued to say to Him, Behold what they are doing on the Sabbath, which is not lawful.

25. And He said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, and those with him?

26. How he entered into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priest, and he gave it to those being with him?

27. And He said to them, The Sabbath was made for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath.

28. So the Son of man is also Lord of the Sabbath. 

## Mark 3

1. He came again into the synagogue, a man was there having a withered hand.

2. And they were watching Him, if He will heal him on the Sabbath, that they might accuse Him.

3. And He says to the man having a withered hand; Rise up in the midst.

4. And He says to them; Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath; to save life, or to kill? And they were silent.

5. And looking round on them with indignation, being grieved over the hardness of their hearts, He says to the man; Reach forth thy hand. And he reached it forth and it was restored.

6. And the Pharisees, having gone out immediately along with the Herodians, took counsel against Him in order that they might kill Him.

7. And Jesus departed with His disciples to the sea: and a great multitude followed Him from Galilee, and from Judea,

8. and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan, and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing so many things that He was doing, came to Him.

9. And He said to His disciples, that a little boat should wait on Him in order that they may not tread on Him.

10. For He healed many; so that they were falling before Him so that they might touch Him, so many as had diseases.

11. And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and were crying out, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

12. And He charged them much that they should not make Him known.

13. And He goes up into the mountain, and calls whom He wished: and they went away to Him.

14. And He made twelve (apostles) that they may be with Him and that He may send them out to preach,

15. and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out the demons.

16. And He placed the name Peter on Simon;

17. and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and on them He placed the names Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:

18. and Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,

19. who also betrayed Him.

20. And He comes into a house; and the multitude come together again so they are not able to eat bread.

21. And those along with Him hearing came out to arrest Him: for they continued to say, He is beside Himself.

22. And the scribes having come down from Jerusalem were saving, He has Beelzebul and He is casting out the demons through the prince of the demons.

23. And calling them to Him, He continued to speak to them in parables, How is Satan able to cast out Satan?

24. And if a kingdom may be divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand,

25. and if a house may be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand;

26. and if Satan stand up against himself, and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has an end.

27. No one is able, having entered into the house of a strong man, to spoil his goods, unless he may first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house.

28. Truly I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies whatsoever they may blaspheme:

29. but whosoever may blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is subject of eternal condemnation.

30. Because they were saying, He has an unclean spirit.

31. And His mother and His brothers come; and standing without, sent to Him, calling Him.

32. And the crowd was sitting round Him; and they say to Him, Behold thy mother and thy brothers without are seeking thee.

33. And He responding to them, says, Who is my mother and my brothers?

34. And looking round on His disciples sitting about Him in a circle, He says, Behold my mother and my brothers!

35. For whosoever may do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and my mother. 

## Mark 4

1. And again He began to teach by the sea: and a great multitude is gathered unto Him, so that He having gone into a ship, sat on the sea; and the whole multitude was at the sea on the land.

2. And He was teaching them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them,

3. Hear: Behold, a sower went out to sow:

4. and it came to pass while he was sowing, some fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured it.

5. And other fell upon stones, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:

6. and when the sun arose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.

7. And other fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit.

8. And other fell in good ground, and springing up and growing, gave fruit, and produced, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.

9. And He said, Let the one having ears to hear, hear.

10. And when they were alone, and those around Him along with the twelve asked Him the parable.

11. And He said to them, To you it has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them who are without, all things are in parables:

12. in order that seeing they may see, and not know; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they may turn, and their sins may he forgiven unto them.

13. And He says to them, Do you not understand this parable? and how will you know all parables?

14. The sower sows the word.

15. And those who are by the way-side, where the word is sown; and when they hear it, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which was sown in their hearts.

16. And those who are sowed upon the rocks are likewise, those who, when they may hear the word, immediately with joy receive it.

17. And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary; then tribulation or persecution arising on account of the word, they are immediately offended:

18. and others are those who are sown among the thorns; they are those hearing the word,

19. and the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and desires concerning other things coming into them, choke out the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

20. And these are they who are sown on good ground; whosoever hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.

21. And He said to them; Whether does the light come, that it may be placed under a bushel, or under a bed? is it not that it may be placed on a candlestick?

22. For there is nothing hidden which may not be made manifest; neither is there any thing concealed, but that it may come into the light.

23. If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And He said to them. See what you hear: with what measure you measure it shall be measured unto you: and it shall be added unto you who hear.

25. For whosoever has, it shall be given unto him: and he who has not, it shall be taken from him even that which he has.

26. And He said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as a man may cast seed on the ground;

27. and he may sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed germinates and grows, as he does not know.

28. The earth spontaneously brings forth fruit; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.

29. And when the fruit may develop, immediately he thrusts in the sickle, because the harvest is at hand.

30. And He said, To what may we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable may we present it?

31. Tis like a grain of mustard seed, which when it may be sown upon the earth, is the smallest of all seeds which are upon the earth,

32. and when it may be sowed, it springs up, and becomes the greatest of herbs, and produces great branches; so that the birds of the heavens are able to lodge under its shadow.

33. And in many such parables He continued to speak the word to them, as they were able to hear.

34. And without a parable He did not speak to them: and He privately expounded all things to His disciples.

35. And He says to them, on that day, it being evening, Let us go away to the other side.

36. And leaving the multitude, they receive Him, as He was in the ship; and other ships were also with Him.

37. And there was a great storm of wind: and the waves were dashing into the ship, so that it was already filled.

38. And He was in the stern, sleeping on a pillow: and they awaken Him, and say to Him; Teacher, is there no care to thee that we perish?

39. And being awakened, He said to the sea, Be calm, be quiet. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

40. And He said to them, Why are you so cowardly? how have you not faith?

41. And they feared with a great fear, and continued to say to one another, Who then is this, because the wind and the sea obey Him? 

## Mark 5

1. And they came beyond the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes,

2. And a man from the tombs, with an unclean spirit met Him, having come out of the ship;

3. who had his dwelling among the tombs: neither was any one able to bind him with chains;

4. because frequently he had been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains were slipped off by him, and the fetters torn to pieces.

5. No one was able to tame him: and all the time, night and day, he was among the tombs in the mountains, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

6. And seeing Jesus a great way off, he ran to Him, and worshiped Him;

7. and crying with a loud voice, he says, What is there to me and to thee, O Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee in the name of God, that you may not torment me.

8. For He said to him, Unclean spirit, come out from the man.

9. And He asked him, What is thy name? And he says to Him, My name is Legion; because we are many.

10. And he continued to intreat Him much, that He would not send them out of the country.

11. And there was a great herd of swine feeding in the mountain.

12. And they intreated Him, saying, Send us into the swine, in order that we may go into them.

13. And Jesus immediately permitted them. And the unclean spirits having gone out, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and there were about two thousand: and they were strangled in the sea.

14. And those herding them fled, and reported in the city, and in the country. And they came out to see what it was that came to pass.

15. And they come to Jesus, and see the demonized man sitting down, both clothed and in his right mind, the one called Legion; and they were afraid.

16. And those seeing, related to them how it happened to the demonized man and concerning the swine.

17. And they began to intreat Him to depart from their coasts.

18. And He having come to the ship, the demonized man intreated Him that he should be with Him.

19. And He did not permit him, but says to him, Go to thine own house to thy people, and proclaim to them how many things the Lord has done for thee, and had mercy on thee.

20. And he went away, and began to preach in Decapolis, how many things Jesus did to him. And all were astonished.

21. And Jesus crossing over in the ship again to the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto Him; and He was by the sea.

22. And one of the chief rulers of the synagogue, by name jairus, comes; and seeing Him falls at His feet,

23. and intreats Him much saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: that coming He may lay hands on her, in order that she may be saved and live.

24. And He departed with him; and a great multitude followed Him, even treading on Him.

25. And a certain woman, being in an issue of blood twelve years,

26. and having suffered much from many physicians, and expended all things which were with her, and being profited as to nothing, but rather having come to the worse,

27. hearing concerning Jesus, having come in the crowd behind, touched His garment.

28. For she was saying, If I may touch His garment, I shall be saved.

29. And immediately the issue of her blood was dried up: and she knew in her body that she is healed of her plague.

30. And immediately Jesus, knowing in Himself that the powerhas gone out from Him, turning in the crowd, said, Who touched my garments?

31. And His disciples continued to say to Him, You see the crowd treading upon you, and you say, Who touched me?

32. And He looked round to see her who did it.

33. And the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what has taken place unto herself, came and fell down before Him, and told Him the whole truth.

34. And He said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

35. And He still speaking, they come from the house of the chief ruler of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead: why do you still trouble the Teacher?

36. And Jesus, immediately hearing the word spoken, says to the chief ruler, Fear not, only believe.

37. and He did not permit any one to accompany Him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

38. And He comes into the house of the chief ruler of the synagogue; And He sees a tumult, weeping and wailing much;

39. and having come in, He says to them, Why are you excited and weeping? The child is not dead, but sleepeth.

40. And they hooted at Him. And putting them all out, He takes the father and mother of the child and those with Him, and goes in where the child was.

41. And taking the child by the hand, says to her, Talitha cumi; which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.

42. And immediately the damsel stood up, and walked about; for she was twelve years old. And they were immediately delighted with great delight.

43. And He charged them much that no one should know it; and He said that something should be given to her to eat. 

## Mark 6

1. And He came out thence and comes into His own country; and His disciples follow Him:

2. and it being the Sabbath day, He began to preach in the synagogue: and many hearing were astonished, saying, Whence are these things to this one? and, What wisdom is given unto Him? Such miracles are wrought by His hands.

3. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary? the brother of James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? Are not His sisters here with us? And they were offended in Him.

4. And Jesus said to them; A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and among his relatives, and in his own house.

5. And He was not able to do any miracle there, except laying hands on a few sick people, He healed them.

6. And He was astonished on account of their unbelief.And He went about the villages in a circuit teaching.

7. And He calls the twelve to Him, and began to send them out two by two; and He gave them authority over unclean spirits.

8. And He commanded them that they should take nothing for the way except staff only; no valise, no bread, no money in the girdle;

9. but having put on your sandals: and put not on two coats.

10. And He said to them, Into whatsoever house you may enter, there abide until you may go out from thence.

11. And whatsoever place may not receive you nor hear you, going forth thence, shake off the dust which is beneath your feet for a testimony unto them.

12. And having gone out they preached that they must repent;

13. and they cast out many demons; and anointed many sick with oil, and healed them.

14. And king Herod heard; for His name became known: and said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works are wrought in Him.

15. And others continued to say, That He is Elijah; and others continued to say that He is a prophet, indeed one of the prophets.

16. But Herod hearing said, That, He is John, whom I beheaded; He is risen from the dead.

17. For Herod himself having sent, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip: because he married her.

18. For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy brother.

19. And Herodias hated him, and wished to kill him; and was not able;

20. for Herod was afraid of John, knowing him to be a just and holy man, and he continued to hold him in prison: and hearing him, he continued to do many things, and he was hearing him gladly.

21. And it being a high day, when Herod on his birthday made a feast to his mighty men, and chiliarchs, and the first men of Galilee;

22. and the daughter of Herodias herself, having come in and danced, and pleased Herod and those sitting with him; the king said to the damsel. Ask what you may wish, and I will give it to you.

23. And he promised her, I will give you whatsoever you may ask, even unto the half of my kingdom.

24. And having gone out, she said to her mother, What shall I ask And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

25. And she having come in to the king, immediately with haste asked him, saying; I wish, that you may give to me immediately, the head of John the Baptist in a charger.

26. And the king being grieved exceedingly; on account of his oaths, and those sitting with him, was not willing to reject her.

27. And the king immediately sending forth a soldier of his guard, commanded that his head should be brought.

28. And having departed, he beheaded him in prison: and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.

29. And his disciples having heard, came and took his body, and put it in a sepulcher.

30. The apostles return to Jesus, and related unto Him all things, even so many as they did, and so many as they taught.

31. And He said to them, Come ye privately into a desert place, and rest a little while. For many were coming and going, neither had they leisure even to eat.

32. And they came away into a desert place privately in a ship.

33. And the multitudes saw them going, and many recognized them, and they ran together thither on foot from many cities, and came before them and came together to Him.

34. And Jesus having come out saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion in their behalf, because they were as sheep having no shepherd: and He began to teach them many things.

35. And already the hour being late, His disciples coming to Him, say, That it is a desert place, and the hour is already late:

36. send them away, that having gone into the surrounding country and the villages, they may purchase for themselves bread: for they have not what they may eat.

37. And responding He said to them, You give to them to eat. And they say to Him, Having gone away must we purchase the loaves of two hundred denaria, and give them to eat?

38. And He says to them; How many loaves have you? go and see. And having ascertained, they say, five loaves and two fishes.

39. And He commanded them all to sit down in companies on the green grass.

40. And they sat down in ranks, about one hundred, and about fifty.

41. And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, He blessed them; and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples, that they should dispense to them; and He divided the two fishes among all.

42. And they all ate, and were filled;

43. and they took up the fragments, twelve baskets full, and from the fishes.

44. And those eating the bread were five thousand men.

45. And immediately He constrained His disciples to embark into the ship, and go before Him to the other side to Bethsaida, until He shall send away the multitude.

46. And having dismissed them, He went away into the mountain to pray.

47. And it being evening, the ship was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone upon the land.

48. And He seeing them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them, and about the fourth watch of the night He comes to them, walking on the sea; and He wished to pass by them.

49. But they, seeing Him walking on the sea, thought it was a specter, and cried out.

50. For they all saw Him, and were alarmed. And immediately He spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good cheer; I am He; be not afraid.

51. And He went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased. And they were exceedingly much astonished among themselves, and continued to marvel.

52. For they did not understand concerning the loaves, for their heart was hardened.

53. And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret; and they disembarked.

54. And they having come out from the ship, immediately recognizing Him,

55. they were running round all that country, and they began to carry the sick on beds, when they heard that He is there.

56. And when He departed into the villages, or cities, or countries, they placed the sick in the forums, and call upon Him, and continued to intreat Him that they should touch the hem of His garment: and so many as touched Him were saved. 

## Mark 7

1. And the Pharisees and certain ones of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem, gather to Him.

2. And seeing certain ones of His disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed hands.

3. For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they diligently wash their hands, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders.

4. And from the forum, unless they may baptize themselves, they do not eat: and many other things which they have received to hold, the baptism of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and couches.

5. Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Wherefore do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders: but they eat bread with unwashed hands?

6. And responding He said to them, Beautifully did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as has been written, This people honor me with lips, but their heart is far from me.

7. In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

8. For having left the commandment of God, you are holding the tradition of men.

9. And He said to them, Truly, you make void the commandment of God, that you may hold your own tradition.

10. For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and let the one speaking evil of father and mother die the death.

11. But you say, If a man may say to father or mother, Corban, that is a gift, whatsoever you may be profited by me;

12. and you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother;

13. making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have given: and you do many such similar things.

14. And calling the crowd to Him again, He said to them, Hear all ye, and understand.

15. There is nothing without a man coming into him, which is competent to defile him: but those things coming out from him, these are the things which defile the man.

16. If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.

17. And when He came from the multitude into the house, His disciples asked Him the parable.

18. And He says to them, Are you still without understanding? Do you not know that everything external entering into a man is not able to defile him?

19. Because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is cast out into the excrement, purifying all edibles.

20. And He said, Everything proceeding out from the man, that defiles the man.

21. For within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, adulteries, fornications, murders,

22. thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, impurity, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, folly.

23. All these evils proceed out from within, and defile the man.

24. And rising up, He departed thence into the regions of Tyre and Sidon. And having entered into a house, and He wished no one to know it: and He was not able to be hidden.

25. For a woman hearing concerning Him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come worshiped at His feet.

26. For the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by race; and asked Him that He may cast the demon out of her daughter.

27. And He said to her, Permit the children first to be fed: for It is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to little dogs.

28. And she responded and says to Him, Yea, Lord: for even the little dogs eat the crumbs of the children under the table.

29. And He said to her, On account of this word go; the demon has already gone out from thy daughter.

30. And having come into her house, she found the demon gone out, and the daughter lying on the bed.

31. And having again come out from Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, amid the coasts of Decapolis.

32. And they bring Him a deaf man, speaking with difficulty; and intreat Him that He may lay His hand on him.

33. And taking him from the crowd privately, He put His fingers in his ears, and having spat, He touched his tongue;

34. and looking up to heaven, he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be thou opened.

35. And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue loosed, and he continued to speak distinctly.

36. And He charged them that they should tell no one: and the more He charged them, the more abundantly they proclaimed it.

37. And were astonished exceedingly, saying, He has done all things well: He makes the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. 

## Mark 8

1. In those days, the multitude being large, and having nothing which they may eat, Jesus calling His disciples, says to them,

2. I sympathize with the multitude because three days already abide unto me, and they have nothing which they may eat.

3. If I shall send them away to their homes fasting, they will faint on the road; indeed some of them have come from afar.

4. And His disciples responded, Whence shall any one be able to feed these with bread in the desert?

5. And He asked them, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven loaves.

6. He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, He broke, and gave them to His disciples, that they may dispense them; and they presented them to the multitude.

7. And they had a few fishes: and blessing them, He delivered them.

8. And they ate, and were filled: and they took up the residue of the fragments, seven baskets.

9. And those eating were about four thousand. And He sent them away.

10. And immediately having gone into the ship with His disciples, He came to the parts of Dalmanutha.

11. And the Pharisees came out, and began to question Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven. tempting Him.

12. And groaning in spirit, He says, What sign does this generation seek after? truly I say unto you, No sign shall be given unto this generation.

13. And having left them, coming in again He departed to the other side.

14. And they forgot to take bread; and had but one loaf with them in the ship.

15. And He commanded them, saying, See, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

16. And they were reasoning to one another, saying, It is because we have not bread.

17. And Jesus knowing says to them, Why do you reason because you have not bread? do you not yet know, nor understand? have you your heart still hardened?

18. Having eyes, do you not see? having ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember?

19. When I broke the five loaves to the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They say to Him, Twelve.

20. And when the seven loaves to the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.

21. And He said to them, Do you not yet understand?

22. And they come into Bethsaida: and they bring Him a blind man, and they intreat Him that He may touch him.

23. And taking the blind man by the hand, He led him out of the village; and spitting in his eyes, putting His hands on him, He asked him, if he sees anything.

24. And looking up he said, I see the men walking about like trees.

25. Then again He put His hands on his eyes, and he looked up; and was restored, and saw all things distinctly.

26. And He sent him to his own house, saying, Go not into the village.

27. And Jesus and His disciples went away into the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Whom do the people say that I am?

28. And they answered Him saying, John the Baptist: and others, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.

29. And He asked them, Whom do you say that I am? And Peter responding says to Him, Thou art the Christ.

30. And He charged them that they should speak to no one concerning Him.

31. And He began to teach them, that it behooves the Son of man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.

32. And He was boldly speaking the word. And Peter taking Him to him began to rebuke Him.

33. And He turning and seeing His disciples rebuked Peter, and says, Get behind me, adversary: because thou art not thinking the things of God, but those of men.

34. And calling the multitude to Him with His disciples, He said to them, Whosoever wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

35. For whosoever may wish to save his soul shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his soul for my sake and that of the gospel shall save it.

36. For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

37. For what would a man give in exchange for his soul?

38. For whosoever may be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and wicked generation, the Son of man shall also be ashamed of him, when He may come in the glory of His Father with the holy angels. 

## Mark 9

1. And He said to them, Truly I say unto you, that there are certain ones of those standing here, who may not taste of death, until they may see the kingdom of God, having come with power.

2. After six days Jesus takes Peter, and John, and James, and carries them up into an exceedingly high mountain privately alone; and was transfigured before them:

3. and His raiment became resplendent, exceedingly white like snow; as no fuller on earth is able to whiten.

4. And Elijah was seen by them with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.

5. And Peter responding says to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah:

6. for he did not know what he might say; for they were afraid.

7. And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear ye Him.

8. And immediately looking around, they saw no one, but Jesus only with them.

9. And they coming down from the mountain, He charged them, that they should relate to no one the things which they saw, until the Son of man may rise from the dead.

10. And they held the word to themselves, inquiring, what it is to rise from the dead.

11. And they asked Him, saying, that the scribes say, that it behooves Elijah first to come.

12. He responding said to them, Elijah indeed having first come, restores all things: and how has it been written in reference to the Son of man, that he should suffer many things, and be set at naught?

13. But I say unto you, that Elijah indeed has come, and they did unto him so many things as they wished, as has been written in reference to him.

14. And having come to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them and the scribes disputing with them!

15. And immediately the whole multitude, seeing Him, became excited, and running to Him, seized Him; and He asked the scribes,

16. Why are you disputing with them?

17. And one responding from the multitude, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.

18. And when he may take him, he lacerates him: and he froths, and gnashes his teeth, and pines away. And I said to thy disciples, that they should cast him out; and they were not able.

19. And He responding to them, says, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.

20. And they brought him to Him; and seeing Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him; and falling on the ground, he continued to wallow, foaming.

21. And He asked his father, How long is it since this occurred to him? And he said, from childhood:

22. and frequently he cast him into the fire and into the waters, in order that he may destroy him: but if you are able to do anything, assist us, being moved with compassion towards us.

23. And Jesus said to him, It is this, if you are able (to believe); all things are possible to him that believeth.

24. And immediately the father of the child crying out with tears, continued to say, I believe; assist thou my unbelief.

25. And Jesus seeing that the multitude are running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out from him, and enter no more into him.

26. And crying out, and convulsing he came out. And he became like a corpse; so that many said, that, he is dead.

27. And Jesus, taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he stood up.

28. And His disciples asked I Iim privately, having come into the house, Why were we not able to cast him out?

29. And He said unto them, This kind is able to come out by nothing, but by prayer.

30. And they coming out thence, traveled through Galilee; and He was not willing that any one should know it.

31. For He was teaching His disciples, and saying to them, The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and having been killed, He will rise again the third day.

32. And they did not understand the word, and they were afraid to ask Him.

33. And He came into Capernaum.And He being in the house asked them, What were you disputing about to one another in the way?

34. And they were silent: for they were disputing to one another in the way, who was the greater.

35. And sitting down, He called the twelve; and says to them, If any one wishes to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.

36. And taking a little child, He placed it in their midst; and taking it up in His arms, He said to them,

37. Whosoever may receive one of such little children in my name, receives me: and whosoever may receive me, receives not me, but Him that sent me.

38. And John responded to Him saying, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in Thy name, who does not follow us; and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.

39. And Jesus said, Forbid him not. For there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.

40. For whosoever is not against us, is on our side.

41. For whosoever may give you a cup of water in my name, because you are Christ's, truly I say unto you, can not lose his reward.

42. Whosoever may offend one of these little ones who believe in me, rather is it good for him, if a millstone is hung about his neck, and he may be cast into the sea.

43. And if thy hand may offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to go into life maimed, rather than having two hands to go away into hell, into the fire that can not be quenched.

44. If thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to go into life lame, rather than have two feet to be cast into hell.

45. If thine eye may offend thee, cast it from thee: it is good for thee entering into the kingdom of God having one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;

46. where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.

47. For every one shall be salted with fire.

48. Salt is good: but if the salt may become savorless, with what will you salt it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace with one another. 

## Mark 10

1. Rising up thence He comes into the coasts of Judea, through the region beyond the Jordan; and the multitudes again come to Him, and, as was His custom, He again taught them.

2. And the Pharisees having come forward asked Him, If it is lawful for a man to send away his wife? tempting Him.

3. And He responding said to them, What did Moses command you?

4. And they said, Moses permitted to write a book of divorcement, and to send her away.

5. Jesus said to them, On account of the hardness of your heart he wrote this commandment to you.

6. But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.

7. On this account a man shall leave his father and his mother,

8. and they two shall be one flesh; so they are no longer two, but one flesh.

9. And what God joined together, let no man separate.

10. And His disciples again around Him in the house asked Him. And He says to them,

11. Whosoever may send away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery unto her.

12. And if she having sent away her husband, may marry another, she commits adultery.

13. And they continued to bring little children to Him, that He should touch them: but the disciples rebuked those bringing them.

14. But Jesus seeing was displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

15. Truly, I say unto you, Whosoever may not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, can not enter into it.

16. And taking them up in His arms, putting His hands on them, He continued to bless them copiously.

17. And He traveling along the road, one having run to Him and worshiping Him, asked Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do in order that I may inherit eternal life?

18. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, God.

19. You know the commandments, thou must not commit adultery, thou must not murder, thou must not steal, thou must not bear false witness, thou must not defraud, honor thy father and mother.

20. And he said to Him, Teacher, I have kept all these from my youth.

21. Jesus looking on him loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

22. And he being grieved at the word, went away sorrowing: for he had great possessions.

23. And Jesus looking around, says to His disciples; How hardly shall those having riches enter into the kingdom of God!

24. And the disciples were astonished at His words, and Jesus again responding, says to them, Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of God.

26. And they were astonished exceedingly, saying to one another, And who is able to be saved?

27. And Jesus looking upon them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.

28. Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we have left all things, and followed thee.

29. Jesus said, Truly I say unto you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, on account of me and the gospel,

30. except he may receive a hundredfold now in this time, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the coming age eternal life.

31. But many who are first shall be last; and the last first.

32. And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and following they were afraid. And taking the twelve to Himself, again He began to tell them the things which were about to happen to Him;

33. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn Him to death, and they will deliver Him to the Gentiles:

34. and they will mock Him, and will scourge Him, and will spit upon Him, and will kill Him; and He will rise the third day.

35. James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to Him, saying, Teacher, we wish that you may do unto us whatsoever we may ask.

36. And He said to them, What do you wish for me to do for you?

37. And they said to Him, Grant unto us, that we may sit, one on thy right, and one on thy left, in thy glory.

38. And Jesus said to them, You know not what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink? and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?

39. And they said to Him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink the cup which I drink, and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized:

40. but to sit on my right, and on my left, is not mine to give, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.

41. And the ten hearing, began to be indignant concerning James and John.

42. And Jesus calling them to Him, says to them: You know that those seeming competent to rule the Gentiles domineer over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.

43. But it is not so among you: but whosoever may wish to be great among you, shall be your servant:

44. and whosoever of you may wish to be first, shall be the slave of all:

45. for the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His soul a ransom for many.

46. And they come into Jericho: and He and His disciples and a great multitude going out from Jericho, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, was sitting by the wayside, begging.

47. And hearing that it is Jesus the Nazarene, began to cry out, and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.

48. And many continued to rebuke him that he should keep silent: but he continued to cry out much more, O son of David, have mercy on me.

49. And Jesus standing, said, that he should be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage: rise up, He calls you.

50. And he, casting away his cloak, rising, came to Jesus.

51. And Jesus responding said to him, What do you wish that I shall do to you? And the blind man said to Him, Great Master, that I may look up.

52. And Jesus said to him, Go; thy faith hath saved thee: and immediately he looked up, and followed Jesus in the way. 

## Mark 11

1. And when they draw nigh to Jerusalem and to Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, He sends away two of His disciples,

2. and says to them, Go into the village over against you: and immediately entering into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men has ever sat; loosing him, lead him away.

3. And if any one may say to you, Why do you this? say to him, that the Lord hath need of him; and immediately he sends him hither.

4. Then they departed, and found the colt tied at the door without at the crossing of the road; and they are loosing him.

5. And certain ones of those standing there said to them, What are you doing, loosing the colt?

6. And they said to them as Jesus commanded: and they permitted them.

7. And they lead the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and He sat on him.

8. And many strewed their garments in the road; and others were cutting down the branches of the trees, (and strewing them in the road),

9. And those going before, and those following after, continued to cry out, Hosanna: blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord:

10. blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest!

11. And He came into Jerusalem, into the temple; and looking round upon all things, the hour being already late, He went out into Bethany along with the twelve.

12. And on the morrow, they going out from Bethany, He was hungry.

13. And seeing a fig-tree at a distance, having leaves, He came, if perchance He shall find something on it: and having come to it, He found nothing except leaves; for it was not the time of the figs.

14. And responding He said to it, Let no one ever eat fruit from thee. And His disciples heard Him.

15. And they come into Jerusalem: and He having come into the temple, began to cast out the buyers and sellers in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money-exchangers, and the seats of those selling doves;

16. and He did not suffer that any one should carry a vessel through the temple.

17. And He was teaching, saying to them, Is it not written, That my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the Gentiles? But you have made it a den of thieves.

18. And the scribes and high priests heard Him, seeking how they might destroy Him: for they feared Him, because all the multitude were delighted with His teaching.

19. And when it was evening, He departed out of the city.

20. And going along in the morning, they saw the fig-tree utterly withered from the roots.

21. And Peter remembering says to Him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou didst execrate is withered away.

22. And Jesus responding says to them, Have God's faith.

23. Truly I say unto you, That whosoever may say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and may not doubt in his heart, but believe that what he says does take place; it shall be unto him.

24. Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever you pray for and ask, believe that you just now received them, and they shall be unto you.

25. And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have aught against any one; in order that your Father who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses.

26. They come again into Jerusalem. And He walking round in the temple, the high priests, and scribes, and elders come to Him;

27. and they said to Him, By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you this authority that you may do them?

28. And Jesus said to them, I will ask you one word, and you respond to me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:

29. Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.

30. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we may say, It is from heaven; He will say, Why did you not believe on him?

31. But if we may say, From men; they feared the people: for all held John that he was a prophet.

32. And responding they say to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus says to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 

## Mark 12

1. And He began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge round it, and dug a wine-trough; and built a tower, and he gave it out to husbandmen, and went away.

2. And he sent a servant to the husbandmen in the season, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard:

3. and they taking him, beat him, and sent him away empty.

4. And again he sent to them another servant; and stoning him they wounded him in the head, and sent him away dishonored.

5. And again he sent another; and they slew him, and many others beating some, killing others.

6. Then having still one son, his own beloved, he sent him also to them last, saying; That they will reverence my son.

7. And those husbandmen said to one another; This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.

8. And taking him they slew him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

9. What then shall the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.

10. Have you not read the Scripture; The stone which the builders rejected, the same has come to be the head of the corner:

11. this was with the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes?

12. And they were seeking to arrest Him; and they feared the multitude; for they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him they went away.

13. And they send to Him certain ones of the Pharisees and Herodians, that they may catch Him with speech.

14. And they having come, say to Him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and there is not a care to thee for any one: for thou dost not look into the face of men, but thou dost teach the way of God in truth: is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? must we give, or must we not give?

15. And knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why tempt ye me? Bring to me the denarion, that I may see it.

16. And they brought it. And He says to them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they say to Him, Caesar's.

17. And Jesus responding said to them, Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's. And they were astonished at Him.

18. And the Sadducees come to Him, who say there is no resurrection; and asked Him, saying;

19. Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if the brother of any man may die, and leave a wife and have no children, that his brother must take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.

20. There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

21. And the second received her and died, and he left no seed; and the third likewise.

22. And the seven received her and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.

23. Then in the resurrection, when they may rise, of which one of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her a wife.

24. And Jesus responding, said to them; Therefore do you not err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God?

25. For when they may rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but they are as angels in the heavens.

26. But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses at the Bush, how God spoke to him saying; I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You do err much.

28. And a certain one of the scribes, hearing them propounding questions, knowing that He answered them beautifully, asked Him, What is the first commandment of all?

29. And Jesus responded to him, The first commandment of all; Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, is one Lord:

30. and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment.

31. And the second is like unto it; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.

32. And the scribes said to Him, Truly, Teacher; thou hast spoken in truth that He is One; and there is no other besides Him.

33. And love Him with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to love thy neighbor as thyself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

34. And Jesus seeing that he answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to ask Him any more,

35. And Jesus responding spoke, teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?

36. For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, the Lord said unto my Lord; Sit thou on my right hand, until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet!

37. Then David himself calls Him Lord; and whence is He his son? And the great multitude were hearing Him delightfully.

38. And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and salutations in the forums,

39. and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers.

40. They are those devouring the houses of widows, and making long prayers through pretext; they shall receive the greater judgment.

41. And He sitting in front of the treasury, was seeing how the multitudes are casting their money into the treasury. And many rich people were casting in much.

42. And one poor widow was casting in two mites, which is a farthing.

43. And calling His disciples to Him, He says to them, Truly I say unto you, That this poor widow has cast in more than all those casting into the treasury.

44. For all they of that which abounds unto them cast in; but she of her scarcity cast in all things so many as she had, all her living. 

## Mark 13

1. And He departing out from the temple, one of His disciples says to Him, Teacher, behold, how great stones and how great buildings!

2. And Jesus responding said to him, Do you see these great buildings? stone may not be left upon stone, which may not be thrown down.

3. And He sitting upon the Mount of Olives in front of the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,

4. Tell us, when these things shall be? and what shall be the sign when all these things may be about to have an end?

5. And Jesus began to say to them, See, lest any one may deceive you.

6. For many will come in my name, saying, I am He; and will deceive many. I

7. And when you may hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not disturbed: for it behooves it to be so; but the end is not yet.

8. For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earth-quakes in divers places; and there shall be famines.

9. These are the beginnings of travails. But you take heed to yourselves: for they will deliver you into councils; and will beat you in the synagogues: and you shall stand before governors and kings on account of me, for a testimony unto them.

10. And it behooves the gospel first to be preached to all the nations.

11. And when they may lead you forth, delivering you up, do not be solicitous what you may speak, nor meditate: but whatsoever may be given to you in that hour, speak this: for you are not those speaking, but the Holy Spirit.

12. And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father the child; and the children will rise up against the parents, and put them to death.

13. And you shall be hated by all on account of my name: but the one persevering to the end, the same shall be saved.

14. And when you may see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not (let him that readeth know), then let those in Judea fly to the mountains:

15. and let not the one on the housetop come down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house:

16. and let not the one who is in the field turn back to take his garment.

17. But alas unto those who are in gestation and nursing in those days.

18. But pray that your flight may not be in the winter.

19. For these days will be tribulation, such as has never been from the beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never may be.

20. And unless the Lord shortened those days, no flesh would be saved: but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.

21. And if then one may say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, Lo, there; believe not.

22. For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and give signs and wonders, to deceive even the elect, if possible.

23. But you see: behold, I have foretold you all things.

24. And in those days, after that desolation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light,

25. and the stars of heaven will be falling, and the powers which are in the heavens shall be shaken.

26. And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

27. And then He will send forth His angels, and will gather His elect from the four winds, from the extremity of the earth unto the extremity of heaven.

28. But learn the parable from the fig-tree: when her branches may be now tender, and she may grow out leaves, know that the summer is nigh.

29. So you also, when you may see these things take place, know that it is already at the doors.

30. Truly I say unto you, this race may not pass away, until all these things may be fulfilled.

31. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

32. But concerning that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, or the Son, but the Father.

33. Beware, watch; for you know not when the time is.

34. As a man, going away, leaving his own house, and giving authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and commanded the porter that he should watch.

35. Watch therefore: for you know not when the Lord of the house cometh, late, or at midnight, or at the crowing of the cock, or in the morning;

36. lest having come suddenly he may find you sleeping.

37. And the things I say to you, I say to all, Watch. 

## Mark 14

1. And it was the passover and feast of unleavened bread after two days. And the high priests and scribes were seeking how they might kill Him, having taken Him by stratagem.

2. For they said, Not at the feast, lest there shall be an uproar of the people.

3. And He being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, He sitting at the table, a woman came having an alabaster box of myrrh of spikenard estimated very valuable; and breaking the alabastar box, she poured it on His head.

4. And there were certain ones indulging in indignation among themselves (and saying), For what was this loss of the myrrh?

5. For this myrrh was able to be sold for more than three hundred denaria, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

6. And Jesus said, Let her alone; why do you give her trouble? she hath wrought a beautiful work in me.

7. For you have the poor always with you, and when you wish, you are able to do them good: but you have not me always.

8. She did what she could: she came aforehand to anoint my body for the burial.

9. Truly I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel may be preached in all the world, that which she did shall indeed be spoken of for a memorial of her.

10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Him to them.

11. And they, hearing, rejoiced, and promised to give him money. And he was seeking how he might betray Him opportunely.

12. And on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they were accustomed to slay the passover, His disciples say to Him; Where do you wish, that we, having gone away may prepare that you may eat the passover?

13. And He sends away two of His disciples, and says to them; Go into the city and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him,

14. whithersoever he may go in, say to the landlord that the Teacher says, Where is my guest chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?

15. And he will show you a large upper room furnished, ready; there prepare for us.

16. And His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found as He said to them, and prepared the passover.

17. And it being evening, He comes with the twelve.

18. And they sitting and eating, Jesus said, Truly, I say unto you, that, One of you who eateth with me shall betray me.

19. And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Whether am I the one? And another, Whether am I the one?

20. And He said to them, One of the twelve who is dipping with me in the dish.

21. Truly the Son of man goes, as has been written concerning Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man had never been born.

22. And they eating, Jesus having taken the bread, blessing it, broke, and gave it to them, and said, Take it: this is my body.

23. And taking the cup, blessing it, He gave it to them, and all drank of it.

24. And He said to them, This is my blood, which belongs to the new covenant, which is poured out for many.

25. Truly I say unto you, That I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I may drink it new in the kingdom of God.

26. And they having sung a hymn, went out into the Mount of Olives.

27. And Jesus says to them, You will all be offended, because it has been written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.

28. But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

29. And Peter said to Him, If indeed, all shall be offended, yet not I.

30. And Jesus says to him, Truly I say unto thee, That thou to-day, even this night, before the cock shall crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.

31. And he continued to say the more positively, If it may behoove me to die with thee, I can never deny thee. And all continued to say likewise.

32. And they come into the place whose name is Gethsemane. And He says to His disciples, Sit here, until I may pray.

33. And He takes Peter, and John, and James with Him, and began to grieve and to be dejected.

34. And He says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death: abide here, and watch.

35. And having gone forward a little, He fell on the ground; and continued to pray, that if possible, the hour may pass from Him.

36. And He said, Father, Father, all things are possible to thee; take this cup from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.

37. And He comes, and finds them sleeping, and He says to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Were you not able to watch one hour?

38. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation: for the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

39. And again having gone away, He prayed, speaking the same word.

40. And turning, He found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what they might respond to Him.

41. And He comes the third time, and says to them; Sleep on, and take your rest: it is over; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners:

42. arise, let us go: behold, the one having betrayed me draws nigh.

43. And immediately, He still speaking, Judas Iscariot comes, being one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

44. And the one having betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, The one whom I shall kiss, is He: seize Him and lead Him away securely.

45. And having come, immediately advancing forward, he said to Him, Master, and kissed Him copiously.

46. And they laid their hands on Him and arrested Him.

47. And a certain one of those standing by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

48. Jesus responding said to them, You have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me:

49. I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me: but in order that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.

50. And all leaving Him, fled away.

51. And one certain young man followed Him, invested with a linen cloth on his unclothed body: and they take hold of him.

52. And he leaving the linen cloth, fled from them in a state of nudity.

53. And they led Jesus to the high priest: and all the chief priests and elders and scribes came together to Him.

54. And Peter followed Him a long way off, even into the court of the high priest; and was sitting with the officers, and warming at the fire.

55. And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking testimony against Him to put Him to death; and they found none.

56. For many were testifying falsely against Him, and their testimonies were not equal.

57. And certain ones rising up, were testifying falsely against Him, saying,

58. We heard Him saying, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and will build another in three days, made without hands.

59. And thus their testimony was not equal.

60. And the high priest rising up in their midst, asked Jesus, saying, Do you respond nothing? what are they witnessing against you?

61. And He was silent, and answered nothing: again the high priest asked Him, and says to Him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?

62. And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

63. The high priest tearing his garments, says, Why have we yet need of witnesses?

64. You heard the blasphemy: what seems to you? And all answered, He is worthy of death.

65. And certain ones began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and to buffet Him, and say to Him, Prophesy: and the officers received Him with blows.

66. And Peter being in the court, one of the maidservants of the high priest comes down;

67. and seeing Peter warming, looking upon him, says, Thou wast with Jesus the Nazarene.

68. And he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what you say. And he went out into the portico; and the cock crew.

69. And the maidservant seeing him again, began to say to the bystanders, He is one of them.

70. And again he denied: and after a little again the bystanders were saying to Peter, Truly, thou art one of them; for indeed thou art a Galilean.

71. But he began to anathematize, and to swear, I know not this man of whom you speak.

72. And the cock crew the second time. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus told him; That, before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And having gone out, he continued to weep. 

## Mark 15

1. And immediately early in the morning the high priests having made counsel with the elders and scribes, and all the sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.

2. And Pilate asked Him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And responding He says to him, Thou sayest it.

3. And the chief priests were accusing Him of many things.

4. And Pilate again asked Him, saying, Do you not answer? behold, how many things they witness against you.

5. And Jesus responded nothing at all; so that Pilate marveled.

6. But during the feast he was accustomed to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked,

7. And there was one called Barabbas, having been bound along with the insurrectionists, who had committed murder during the insurrection.

8. And the multitude crying out began to ask, as he was always accustomed to do unto them.

9. And Pilate responded to them, saying, Do you wish that I may release unto you the King of the Jews?

10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him on account of envy.

11. And the chief priests persuaded the multitude that he should rather release unto them Barabbas.

12. And Pilate responding again said to them, Then what do you wish that I shall do unto Him whom you call the King of the Jews.

13. And they again cried out, Crucify Him.

14. And Pilate said to them, For what evil hath He done? And they cried out uproariously, Crucify Him.

15. And Pilate, wishing to do the multitude a favor, released unto them Barabbas.And having scourged Jesus, he delivered Him up that He should be crucified.

16. And the soldiers led Him into the court, which is the judgment hall; and call around Him the whole band.

17. And they put on Him a purple robe, and having plaited a thorny crown, put it on Him.

18. And they began to mock Him, Hail, King of the Jews!

19. And they continued to strike His head with a reed, and spit on Him, and putting down their knees worshiped Him.

20. And when they mocked Him, they divested Him of the purple robe, and put on Him His own raiment: and lead Him away in order that they may crucify Him.

21. And they compel a certain Simon, a Cyrenean, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he must take His cross.

22. And they lead Him to Golgotha, a place which is interpreted, The place of a skull.

23. And they gave Him myrrhed wine to drink: and He did not take it.

24. And they crucify Him, and divide His garments, casting the lot upon them, what each one may take.

25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.

26. And the superscription of His accusation was written over Him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27. And they crucify two thieves along with Him; the one on His right, and one on His left.

28. And passing by they continued to blaspheme Him, wagging their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,

29. save thyself, and come down from the cross.

30. Likewise also the chief priests mocking to one another with the scribes, continued to say, He saved others; He is not able to save Himself.

31. Let Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, in order that we may see and believe. And those being crucified along with Him were reproaching Him.

32. And it being the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

33. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

34. And certain ones of those standing by said, Behold, He is calling Elijah.

35. And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and reaching it forth on a reed, gave Him drink, saying, Let Him alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.

36. And Jesus, sending forth a loud voice, expired.

37. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top even to the bottom.

38. And the centurion standing by in front of Him, seeing that He thus expired, said; Surely this man was the Son of God.

39. And there were women looking on from a distance: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and Joses, and Salome;

40. who when He was in Galilee, were accustomed both to follow Him, and minister unto Him. And many other women who came up to Jerusalem along with Him.

41. And it already being evening, since it was the Preparation, which is the day before the Sabbath,

42. Joseph, who is from Arimathea, an honorable councilor, who also himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; having taken courage came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

43. And Pilate was astonished if He had died already. And having called the centurion, asked him if He was already dead.

44. And having learned from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

45. And having purchased linen, and taking Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen, and placed Him in a sepulcher which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.

46. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking where He is placed. 

## Mark 16

1. And the Sabbath passing away, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, prepared aromatics, in order that having come they may anoint Him.

2. And exceedingly early in the morning, the first of the Sabbaths, they come to the sepulcher, the sun approaching the horizon.

3. And they were saying to themselves, Who shall for us roll away the stone from the sepulcher?

4. And looking up, they see that the stone has already been rolled away: for it was exceedingly great.

5. And having come to the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe. And they were affrighted.

6. But he says to them, Fear not: you are seeking Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified: He is risen; He is not here: see the place where they laid Him.

7. But go, tell His disciples and Peter, that He goes before you into Galilee: you shall see Him there, as He told you.

8. And having come out from the sepulcher, they fled; and trembling and ecstasy possessed them, and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.
