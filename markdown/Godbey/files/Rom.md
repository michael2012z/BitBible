## Romans 1

1. Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an apostle, having been separated unto the gospel of God,

2. which He proclaimed beforehand through His prophets in the holy scriptures,

3. concerning his Son, having been born of the seed of David according to the flesh;

4. having been ordained the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, from the resurrection of the dead, of Jesus Christ our Lord:

5. through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, in behalf of his name:

6. among whom ye are also called of Jesus Christ:

7. to all the beloved of God who are in Rome, saints having been called. Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

8. In the first place, indeed, I praise my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

9. For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how I unceasingly make mention of you always in my prayer;

10. praying, if by any means I shall be prospered in the will of God to come to you.

11. For I long to see you, in order that I may impart unto you a certain spiritual grace, that you may be established;

12. but this is the consolation among you through faith in one another, both of you and me.

13. But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that frequently I purposed to come to you, and was hindered hitherto, in order that I may have some fruit among you, as well as also among other Gentiles.

14. I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians; both to the wise, and the unwise:

15. so to my utmost ability, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.

16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

17. For the righteousness of God is revealed in him from faith to faith: as has been written, But the just shall live by faith.

18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

19. because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God has revealed it to them:

20. for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are seen, being known by the things which are made, even His eternal power and divinity; so that they are without excuse:

21. because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were they thankful; but they became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened.

22. Saying that they were wise, they became fools,

23. and changed the glory of the invisible God into the similitude of the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of quadrupeds, and of creeping things.

24. Therefore God gave them up, in the lusts of their hearts, to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves:

25. who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for evermore: amen.

26. On account of this God gave them up to the lusts of dishonor: for indeed their women changed the natural use to that which is against nature:

27. likewise also the men, having left the natural use of the woman, burned in their desire towards one another; men with men working out disgrace, and receiving the reward of their error among themselves which it behooved.

28. And as they did not approve to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are inappropriate;

29. being filled with all injustice, wickedness, vice, covetousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceitfulness, evil affection;

30. whisperers, calumniators, haters of God, insulters, proud, arrogant, practitioners of evils, disobedient to parents,

31. covenant-breakers, incontinent, without natural affections, unmerciful,

32. who, knowing the rightfulness of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but they even delight in those who are doing them. 

## Romans 2

1. Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one judging. For in whatsoever thou art judging another, thou art condemning thyself; for thou judging art doing the same things.

2. For we know that the judgment of God according to truth is against those doing such things.

3. But do you consider this, O man, judging those doing such things, and doing the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?

4. Do you look with contempt upon the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God is leading you to repentance?

5. But according to thy hardness and thy impenitent heart, thou art treasuring up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God;

6. who will give to each one according to his works:

7. to those indeed who with patience of good work are seeking glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:

8. but to those who are of self-seeking, and disobedient to the truth, but obedient to unrighteousness, there are indignation and wrath.

9. Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that is working out evil, both the Jew first, and the Greek;

10. but glory and honor and peace to every one doing good; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

11. For there is no respect of persons with God.

12. For so many as sinned without law will also perish without law; and so many as sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;

13. for the hearers of the law are not righteous with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

14. For when the Gentiles, not having the law, may by nature do the things of the law, they, not having the law, are a law unto themselves:

15. who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience witnessing, and their thoughts accusing or indeed excusing with one another,

16. in the day when God will judge the secrets of men through my gospel according to Jesus Christ.

17. But if you are denominated a Jew, and rest in the law, and boast in God,

18. and know his will, and approve the things which are excellent, being taught by the law;

19. and persuade yourself that you are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness, an instructor of the ignorant,

20. a teacher of the juveniles, having a form of knowledge and truth in the law;

21. therefore do not you who teach another teach yourself? do you, who preach not to steal, steal?

22. do you, who say not to commit adultery, commit adultery? do you, who abominate idolatry, rob temples?

23. do you, who boast in the law, through the transgression of the law dishonor God?

24. For the name of God is blasphemed by you among the Gentiles, as has been written.

25. For circumcision indeed profits, if you do the law: but if you be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

26. Then if uncircumcision may keep the righteousness of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

27. and that which is uncircumcision by nature, perfecting the law, will judge you, who through the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.

28. For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outwardly in the flesh.

29. But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. 

## Romans 3

1. Then what more belongs to the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?

2. Much every way. For indeed, in the first place, the oracles of God were committed unto them.

3. For what if some did not believe? whether will their unbelief destroy the faith of God?

4. it could not be so: but let God be true, and every man a liar; as indeed it has been written, In order that you may be justified in your words, and shall prevail, in your judgment.

5. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust administering wrath? I speak according to a man.

6. It could not be so: then how will God judge the world?

7. And if the truth of God through my falsehood abounded unto His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?

8. are we not indeed thus traduced, and as some say we speak, that, Let us do evil in order that good may come? whose condemnation is just.

9. Then what? are we the better? By no means: for we have proven already that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;

10. as has been written, There is no one good, not one:

11. there is no one who understands, there is no one who seeks out God;

12. all have gone away, they have all together become unprofitable; there is no one who is doing good, there is not one.

13. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.

14. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.

15. Whose feet are swift to shed blood:

16. destruction and misery are in their ways:

17. and they have not known the way of peace.

18. The fear of God is not before their eyes.

19. But we know that so many things as the law speaks, it says to those under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may become guilty before God.

20. Therefore no flesh shall be justified by works of law: for through law there is a perfect knowledge of sin.

21. And now the righteousness of God without law has been made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

22. but the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ is unto all who believe: for there is no difference,

23. for all sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

24. being freely justified by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:

25. whom God sent forth an expiation through faith in his blood, unto the manifestation of His righteousness through the remission of the sins which are passed,

26. in the forbearance of God; unto the manifestation of his righteousness at the present time, so that he is just, and justifying him who is of the faith of Jesus.

27. Then where is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No; but by the law of faith.

28. For we conclude that a man is justified by faith without works of law.

29. Whether is he the God of the Jews only? is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yea, also of the Gentiles:

30. truly there is one God, who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.

31. Then do we make void the law through faith? It could not be so: but we establish the law. 

## Romans 4

1. Then what shall we say that Abraham, our father according to the flesh, has found?

2. For if Abraham were justified by works, he has glorification; but not before God.

3. For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.

4. But to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt;

5. but to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.

6. Indeed David also speaks of the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,

7. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;

8. blessed is the man of whom the Lord may not impute sin.

9. Then does this blessedness come on the circumcision, or on the uncircumcision? for we say That faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.

10. Then how was it imputed? to him, being in circumcision or uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

11. And he received the sign of circumcision, and the seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision: that he should be the father of all who believed, through uncircumcision; and righteousness should be imputed to them;

12. and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.

13. For the promise to Abraham or his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, was not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.

14. For if the heirs were by the law, faith has been made void, and the promise vitiated.

15. For the law works out wrath: for where there is no law, there is no transgression.

16. Therefore it is by faith, in order that it may be by grace; that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not only of the law, but also of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

17. as it has been written, That I have constituted thee the father of many nations, before God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls things which are not as really existing:

18. who against hope confided in hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be:

19. and being not weak in faith, he considered not his body already dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb:

20. but he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was filled up with dynamite through faith, having given glory to God;

21. and being fully assured, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.

22. Therefore it was indeed imputed unto him for righteousness.

23. And it was not written on account of him alone, that it was imputed to him;

24. but on account of us also, to whom it is about to be imputed, who believe on him who raised up our Lord Jesus from the dead;

25. who was delivered on account of our transgressions, and raised for our justification. 

## Romans 5

1. Therefore having been justified by faith, let us have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ:

2. through whom we also have access by faith unto this grace in which we stand, and let us rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.

3. And not only so, but let us also rejoice in tribulation; knowing that tribulation works out endurance;

4. and endurance, approval; and approval, hope:

5. and hope makes not ashamed; because the divine love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who has been given unto us.

6. For we being yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly:

7. for scarcely will one die for a righteous man; for perhaps some one even dares to die for a good man.

8. And God commends his love to us, because, we being yet sinners, Christ died for us.

9. How much more then, having now been justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.

10. For if being enemies we are reconciled to God through the death of his Son; how much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved through his life:

11. but not only so, but even rejoicing in God through Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we now received reconciliation.

12. Therefore, as by one man sin came into the world, and death by sin; and thus death came upon all men, in that all sinned;

13. (for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed, there being no law;

14. but death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even on those who did not sin after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the type of him who is to come.

15. But not as was the transgression, even so is the free gift: for if by the transgression of one many died, how much more by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, did the grace of God and the gift abound unto many!

16. And not as by the one having sinned, is the free gift; for indeed, judgment was from one unto condemnation, but the free gift is from many transgressions unto justification.

17. For if by the transgression of one death reigned through one; how much more shall those receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Christ Jesus!)

18. Therefore then, as by the transgression of one, judgment came to all men to condemnation; so also through the righteousness of one, the free gift came on all men unto the justification of life:

19. for as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so also by the obedience of one man shall many be made righteous.

20. But the law came, that the transgression might abound; but where sin did abound, there did grace superabound:

21. in order that as sin reigned through death, so may grace reign also through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

## Romans 6

1. Then what shall we say? must we abide in sin, in order that grace may abound?

2. It could not be so. How shall we, who are dead unto sin, live any longer in it?

3. Whether do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized unto Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?

4. Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death: in order that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so must we also walk in newness of life.

5. For if we have grown together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection:

6. knowing this, that our old man is crucified along with him, in order that the body of sin may be destroyed, that we may no longer serve sin;

7. for the one having died has been made free from sin.

8. But if we died along with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him:

9. knowing that Christ having risen from the dead dies no more; death no longer has dominion over him.

10. For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he lives, he lives unto God.

11. So you also thus reckon yourselves dead unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ.

12. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey the lusts of it:

13. neither present your members arms of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members arms of righteousness unto God.

14. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.

15. What then? can we commit sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? it could not be so.

16. Do you not know, that to whom you present yourselves servants unto obedience, ye are servants to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or obedience unto righteousness?

17. But thanks be unto God, that whereas ye were servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart the type of teaching into which ye were delivered:

18. but having been made free from sin, ye became servants unto righteousness.

19. I speak after the manner of a man on account of the weakness of your carnality. For as ye presented your members as servants unto impurity and lawlessness pursuant to lawlessness, so now present your members servants unto righteousness pursuant to sanctification.

20. For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.

21. What fruit then had you at that time in those things in which you are now ashamed? for the end of these things is death.

22. But now having been made free from sin, and having become servants unto God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.

23. For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, 

## Romans 7

1. Whether are you ignorant, O brethren, for I speak to those knowing the law, for the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he may live?

2. For a woman who is under her husband has been given to her husband by the law so long as he lives; but if the husband may die, she is free from the law of the husband.

3. Then if she may be married to another man, her husband still living, she will be designated an adulteress: but if her husband may die, she is free from the law; and is no adulteress, though she is married to another man.

4. So, my brethren, ye are dead to the law through the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, to him who is risen from the dead, in order that we may bring forth fruit unto God.

5. For when we were in carnality, the emotions of sins, which were through the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.

6. But now we have been made free from the law, being dead in that in which we were held; so that we serve in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

7. Then what shall we say? is the law sin? It could not be so; but I did not know sin except through the law: for indeed I had not known lusts, unless the law said, Thou shalt not covet.

8. But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, did work in me all concupiscence; for without law sin was dead.

9. But I was alive at one time without law: but the commandment having come, sin revived,

10. and I died; and the commandment, which was unto life, the same was unto death.

11. For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it slew me.

12. So the law is indeed holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.

13. Then did that which is good become death to me? it could not be so: but sin, that it may appear sin, through the good was working out death to me, in order that sin may be exceedingly sinful through the commandment.

14. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.

15. For that which I do, I know not: for I do that which I do not will; but I do that which I hate.

16. But if I do that which I do not will, I consent to the law that it is beautiful;

17. but now it is no more I that do it, but sin dwelling in me.

18. For I know that in me, that is, in my carnal mind, there dwells no good thing. For to will is present with me, but to do that which is beautiful is not:

19. for the good which I will I do not; but the evil which I do not will, that I do.

20. If I do that which I do not will, it is no longer I that do it, but sin dwelling in me.

21. Then I find a law, that, to me wishing to do that which is beautiful, that the evil is present with me:

22. for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;

23. but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.

24. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

25. Thanks be unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord: then therefore with the mind I serve the law of God; but with carnality the law of sin. 

## Romans 8

1. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.

2. For the law of the Spirit of life has made thee free from the law of sin and of death.

3. For there was an impotency of the law, in which it was weak through depravity, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of the sin of depravity and for sin, condemned sin in depravity:

4. in order that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to depravity, but according to the spirit.

5. For those being in harmony with depravity, do mind the things of depravity, and those in harmony with the Spirit, the things of the Spirit:

6. for the mind of depravity is death: and the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.

7. Therefore the mind of depravity is enmity toward God: for it is not subordinated to the law of God, for it is not able so to be.

8. But those being in depravity are not able to please God.

9. But ye are not in depravity, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.

10. But if Christ is in you, the body is dead so far as sin is concerned; but the Spirit is life so far as righteousness is concerned.

11. But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one having raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also create life in your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who dwells in you.

12. Then therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to depravity, to live according to depravity.

13. For if you live according to depravity, you are about to die: but if through the Spirit you kill the practices of the body, you shall live.

14. For so many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.

15. For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but you received the Spirit of adoption, in which we cry; Father, Father.

16. The Spirit Himself witnesses along with our spirit, that we are the children of God.

17. And if children, indeed heirs; truly heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if we suffer together, in order that we may also be glorified together.

18. For I reckon that the sufferings of these present times are not worthy to be compared to the glory which is about to be revealed in us.

19. For the earnest expectation of the creature awaits the revelation of the sons of God.

20. For the creature has been subordinated to mortality, not willingly, but through Him who subordinated it;

21. therefore indeed pursuant to hope, the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.

22. For we know that all creation groans together and travails together until now;

23. and not only so, but we ourselves, having the earnest of the Spirit, and we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of sons, the redemption of our body.

24. For we are saved by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for why does any one indeed hope for that which he sees?

25. But if we hope for that which we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

26. And likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as it behooves us: but the Spirit himself makes intercession with unutterable groanings:

27. but he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession towards God in behalf of the saints.

28. But we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose.

29. Because whom he did foreknow, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:

30. and whom He did foreknow, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them He also glorified.

31. Then what shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?

32. Indeed he who spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how will He not with him, freely give us all things?

33. Who will lay anything to the charge of God's elect?

34. It is God who justifies: who is he that condemns? It is Christ who died, and rather who is risen, who is on the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding in our behalf.

35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

36. As has been written, that We are killed all day for thy sake; we are counted as sheep of the slaughter.

37. But in all these we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

38. For I am persuaded that, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come,

39. nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

## Romans 9

1. I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

2. that there is great sorrow to me and incessant grief to my heart.

3. For I would pray, that I myself might be an offering from Christ; in behalf of my brethren, my kindred according to the flesh:

4. who are Israelites, of whom is the adoption of sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises:

5. of whom are the fathers, and of whom is Christ according to the flesh. Who is over all, God blessed forever: amen.

6. But not as that the word of God has been a failure. For these are not all Israel who are of Israel;

7. neither are the children all the seed of Abraham; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called;

8. that is the children of the flesh the same are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

9. For this is the word of the promise, About this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.

10. Not only so; but Rebecca also having cohabitation of one, our father Isaac;

11. for the children not having been born, neither having done anything good or evil, in order that the purpose of God might stand according to election not of works, but of him that calleth,

12. and it was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger:

13. as has been written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

14. Then what shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? It could not be so.

15. For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I do have mercy, and I will commiserate whom I do commiserate.

16. Then it is not of him that willeth, nor him that runneth, but of God who shows mercy.

17. For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing have I raised you up, that I may show forth my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.

18. Then therefore he has mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardens.

19. Then thou wilt say to me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?

20. O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Whether shall the thing formed say to him that formed it. Why did you make me thus?

21. Has not the potter the right of the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?

22. But if God, wishing to show forth his indignation and make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of indignation having been perfected unto destruction:

23. and in order that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared unto glory?

24. whom he called, even us, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles:

25. as he says in Hosea, I will call them my people, who are not my people; and her beloved, who is not beloved:

26. and it shall come to pass, in the place in which it was said to them, You are not my people, there they shall be called the sons of the living God:

27. but Isaiah cries out in behalf of Israel, Though the number of sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.

28. For perfecting the word and cutting it short, will the Lord do a complete work on the earth:

29. and as Isaiah has before spoken; Unless the Lord of Sabaoth left to us a seed, we would have become as Sodom, and would have been made like unto Gomorrah:

30. Then what shall we say? That the Gentiles, not pursuing righteousness, received righteousness, and the righteousness which is from faith:

31. but Israel, following after the law, did not attain unto the law of righteousness.

32. Why? Because they sought it not from faith, but as it were from works: they stumbled over the stone of stumbling,

33. as has been written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: and he that believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 

## Romans 10

1. Brethren, indeed the desire of my heart and my prayer to God in their behalf, is for their salvation.

2. For I testify to them, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to perfect knowledge;

3. for being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God.

4. For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one who believes.

5. For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, that the man having done this shall live in it.

6. But the righteousness of faith speaks thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend up into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down:

7. or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring him up from the dead.

8. But what says it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.

9. That if you may confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and may believe with your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved:

10. for with the heart it is believed unto righteousness; and with the mouth it is confessed unto salvation.

11. For the scripture says, Every one believing on him shall not be ashamed.

12. For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: for the same is Lord of all, rich unto all that call on him.

13. For every one who may call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

14. Then how can they call on him on whom they have not believed? and how can they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

15. And how can they preach, unless they may be sent forth? as has been written, How beautiful are the feet of those, who preach the gospel of good things!

16. But they have not all heard the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?

17. Then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.

18. But I say, Have they not all heard? Yea, truly, Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

19. But I say, Whether does not Israel know? Moses first says, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, and with a nation void of understanding I will anger you.

20. But Isaiah is bold, and says, I was found by those not seeking after me; and made manifest to those not inquiring after me.

21. But to Israel he says, All day long have I reached forth my hands to a gainsaying and disobedient people. 

## Romans 11

1. Then I say, Did God cast away his people? it could not be so. For I am indeed an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

2. God did not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says in Elijah, how he makes intercession to God against Israel?

3. Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars: and I am left alone, and they are seeking my life.

4. But what says the answer to him? I have left unto myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

5. Thus then there is even at this time a remnant left according to the election of grace:

6. and if by grace, it is not at all by works: since in that case grace is no more grace.

7. What then? Israel did not attain that which he was seeking, but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:

8. as has been written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.

9. And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:

10. and let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.

11. Then I say; Whether did they stumble that they may fall? it could not be so: but by their fall, salvation came to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.

12. But if the fall of them was the riches of the world, and the depletion of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?

13. But I speak to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry:

14. if perchance I may provoke my flesh, and save some of them.

15. For if the casting away of them was the reconciling of the world, what will their reception be, but life from the dead?

16. But if the first fruit was holy, the lump is also: if the root was holy, the branches are also.

17. And if certain ones of the branches were broken off, and you being a wild olive-tree are grafted in among them, and have become a partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive-tree;

18. boast not against the branches: but if you boast, you are not bearing the root, but the root you.

19. Then you will say, The branches were broken off, that I may be grafted in.

20. Beautifully; they were broken off by unbelief, but you stand by faith, Think not high things, but fear.

21. For if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare you.

22. Then behold the goodness and severity of God: upon those who fell indeed, severity; but upon you the goodness of God, if you may abide in his goodness: since you too may be cut off.

23. But these also, if they may not abide in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.

24. For if you, having been cut off the olive tree which is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into the good olive tree: how much more shall these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

25. I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to this mystery, in order that you may not he wise with yourselves, that blindness in part has happened unto Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles may come in;

26. and so all Israel shall be saved: as has been written, A leader shall come out of Zion, shall turn ungodliness from Jacob.

27. And this is the covenant with me unto them, that I may take away their sins.

28. They are enemies indeed, as touching the gospel, for your sakes: but beloved with reference to election for the sake of the fathers:

29. for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

30. For as you at one time were disobedient to God, but now you have received mercy through their disobedience,

31. even also these were now disobedient, in order that through the mercy shown to you they themselves may now also obtain mercy.

32. For God has shut up all in unbelief, in order that he may have mercy on all.

33. O the depth of the riches of the wisdom of the knowledge of God! His judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past tracing out.

34. For who has known the mind of the Lord? who became his counsellor?

35. or who has given unto him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?

36. Because of Him, and through him, and unto him, are all things: to him be glory forever: amen. 

## Romans 12

1. I exhort you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, your reasonable service:

2. and he not fashioned after this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

3. For I speak, through the grace which has been given unto me, for every one who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, as God has imparted to each one the measure of faith.

4. For we indeed have many members in one body, but all the members have not the same office:

5. so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and members one of another.

6. But having gifts differing according to the grace given unto us, whether prophecy, it is according to the analogy of faith;

7. or ministry, it is in the ministry; or he that teacheth, in teaching;

8. or he that exhorteth, in exhortation; or he that giveth, with a single eye; he that presideth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.

9. Let love be free from hypocrisy. Abhorring the evil, cleaving to the good:

10. kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;

11. not slothful in business; boiling over in spirit; serving the Lord;

12. rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing steadfastly in prayer;

13. communicating to necessities of the saints; pursuing hospitality.

14. Bless them that persecute you; bless, and scold not.

15. Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.

16. Have the same mind toward one another, not thinking high things, but condescending to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.

17. Returning to no one evil for evil; providing things beautiful in the sight of all men.

18. If possible, so far as it is within your power, living in peace with all men;

19. avenging not yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it has been written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.

20. But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink: for doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.

21. Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome the evil with the good. 

## Romans 13

1. Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority except that which is from God; and the existing authorities have been ordained of God.

2. So the one resisting the authority, antagonizes the ordinance of God: and those antagonizing shall receive to themselves judgment.

3. For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Whether do you not wish to fear the authority? do the good, and you shall have praise from it:

4. for he is the minister of God for you for good. But if you do evil, fear; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, executing judgment unto wrath unto the one doing evil.

5. Therefore it is necessary to submit, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.

6. For on account of this also pay tribute; for they are the ministers of God, attending to this very thing.

7. Give to all their dues: custom to whom custom is due; tribute to whom tribute is due; fear to whom fear is due; honor to whom honor is due.

8. Owe no man anything, but to love one another with divine love: for the one loving another with divine love has fulfilled the law.

9. For, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet, and if there is any other commandment, it is fulfilled in this word, in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself with divine love.

10. Divine love works no evil to its neighbor: for divine love is the fulfilling of the law.

11. And recognizing this time, that it is already the hour we should wake out of sleep: for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.

12. For the night is far spent, and the day is at hand. Therefore let us lay aside the works of the darkness, and let us put on the arms of the light.

13. Let us walk circumspectly, as in the day; not with revelries and drunkenness, not with debaucheries and impurities, not in strife and envy:

14. but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the lust of the flesh. 

## Romans 14

1. But receive to yourselves him who is weak in faith, not into disputations of doubtful matters.

2. One indeed believes he is to eat all things: another who is weak, vegetables.

3. Let not the one eating snub the one not eating. Let not the one not eating judge the one eating; for God received him.

4. Who art thou judging another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls: but he shall stand; for God is able to make him stand.

5. For one indeed judges a day above a day: another judges every day (alike); let each one be fully persuaded in his own mind.

6. The one regarding the day, regards it to the Lord: the one eating, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and the one not eating, eats not to the Lord, and gives thanks to God.

7. For no one of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself:

8. for if indeed we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Then indeed if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.

9. For unto this Christ died, and lives, in order that He may be Lord of the dead and of the living.

10. But why do you judge your neighbor, or indeed why do you discount your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.

11. For it has been written; As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

12. Then therefore each one of us shall give an account to God for himself.

13. Then let us no longer judge one another: but rather judge this, not to place before a brother an offence for a stumblingblock.

14. I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: except to him who considers it unclean, to him it is unclean.

15. But if your brother is grieved on account of your meat, you are no longer walking in divine love. Do not by your meat destroy him for whom Christ died.

16. Let not your good be blasphemed.

17. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.

18. For in this the one serving Christ is acceptable to God, and approved unto men.

19. Then therefore we pursue the things belonging to peace, and edification towards one another.

20. Do not destroy the work of God on account of meat. All things are pure; but it is evil to the man who eats with offence:

21. it is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles.

22. The faith which you have, have it with yourself before God. Happy is the one not judging himself in that which he approves:

23. but if he may eat doubting, he has been condemned, because it is not of faith; but every thing which is not of faith is sin. 

## Romans 15

1. But we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

2. Let each of us please his neighbor in that which is good, unto edification;

3. for Christ did not please himself; but, as has been written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

4. For so many things as were previously written were written for our instruction, in order that through the patience and through the consolation of the scriptures we may have hope.

5. But may the God of patience and consolation grant unto you to think the same things among one another with reference to Christ Jesus.

6. In order that you may with one accord with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7. Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.

8. For I say that Christ has been made minister of circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises of the fathers,

9. and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as has been written, Therefore I will confess thee among the Gentiles, and in thy name sing praises.

10. And again he says, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

11. And again, Let all the Gentiles praise the Lord; and let all ye peoples praise him.

12. And again, Isaiah says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.

13. And the God of hope fill you in all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Ghost.

14. But I am indeed persuaded, my brethren, concerning you, that you are also full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, being able also to admonish one another.

15. But I have written unto you more boldly in part, as reminding you, on account of the grace which has been given unto me from God,

16. that I should be the minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles may be well received, having been sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

17. Moreover I have boldness in Christ Jesus as to the things appertaining to God:

18. for I will not dare to speak anything save those things which Christ has wrought through me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles, in word and deed,

19. in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem, and around about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;

20. but being so ambitious not to preach the gospel, where Christ has been named, in order that I may not build on another man's foundation;

21. but, as has been written, Those, to whom he has not been preached, shall see concerning him, and they who have not heard shall understand.

22. Therefore indeed I was hindered much from coming unto you:

23. but now, no longer having a place in these regions, and having an earnest longing for many years to come to you,

24. as I may journey into Spain, for I hope traveling through to see you, and by you to be sent forth thither, if in the first place I may be satisfied with your companyâ€”

25. but now I journey to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints.

26. For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a certain contribution to the poor who are in Jerusalem.

27. For they were pleased to do so; and they are their debtors: for if the Gentiles participated in spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.

28. Then having completed and sealed this fruit unto them, I will sail away for Spain by you;

29. but I know that coming unto you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

30. But I exhort you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you cooperate with me in your prayers to God in my behalf;

31. in order that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and my ministry may be acceptable to the saints in Jerusalem;

32. in order that having come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.

33. Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. 

## Romans 16

1. I commend unto you our sister Phoebe, being a minister of the church which is in Cenchrea,

2. in order that you may receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye may assist her in whatsoever matters she may need you: for she has been a helper of many, and myself.

3. Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-laborers in Christ Jesus;

4. who laid down their neck for my life; and for whom not I alone hut all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks;

5. and the church in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first fruit of Asia unto Christ.

6. Salute Mary, who labored much for you.

7. Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsman and my fellow-soldiers, who are celebrated among the apostles, who were also in Christ before me.

8. Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.

9. Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

10. Salute Apelles the reproved in Christ. Salute those of the household of Aristobulus.

11. Salute Herodian my kinsman. Salute those from the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.

12. Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who are laboring in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord.

13. Salute Rufus the elect in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

14. Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren along with them.

15. Salute Philologus and Julius, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who were with them.

16. Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.

17. But I exhort you, brethren, to mark those who cause divisions and stumblings, contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and depart from them.

18. For such do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach; and through fair speeches and eulogies deceive the hearts of the innocent.

19. For your obedience has come abroad unto all men: therefore I rejoice over you, and wish you to be wise in that which is good, and uncompromising towards that which is evil.

20. The God of peace will speedily crush Satan beneath your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.

21. Timothy my fellow-laborer salutes you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my consanguinity, salute you.

22. I Tertius, the one writing the epistle, salute you in the Lord.

23. Gaius my host, and that of the whole church salutes you. Erastus the steward of the city, and brother Quartus, salute you.

24. To Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery having been hidden during the eternal times,

25. but having now indeed been made manifest, through the prophetical scriptures, and having been made known to all the Gentiles, according to the commandment of the eternal God, unto the obedience of faith;

26. to God who alone is wise, through Jesus Christ, to the glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
