# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show unto his servants the thing which it behooves speedily to come to pass; and he signified having sent by his angel to his servant John;

2. who witnessed the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as to so many things as he saw.

3. Blessed is the one reading, and those hearing the word of the prophecy, and keeping the things which have been written in it: for the time is at hand.

4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from the one who is, and who was, and who is coming; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;

5. and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstbegotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To the one loving us with divine love, and having washed us from our sins in His own blood,

6. and He made us a kingdom, priests unto God even his Father; to him be glory and dominion unto the ages of the ages; amen.

7. Behold, he is coming with clouds; and every eye shall behold him, even those who pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth will wail at him; yes, Amen.

8. I am Alpha and Omega, says the Lord God, who is and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.

9. I John, your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and in patience in Jesus, was in the island which is called Patmos, on account of the word of God, and on account of the testimony of Jesus.

10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet

11. saying, Write what you are seeing in a book, and send it to the seven churches; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

13. and in the midst of the candlesticks one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to his feet, and girded about the breast with a golden girdle.

14. And his head and his hairs were as wool, white as snow; and his eyes were like a flame of fire;

15. and his feet were like brass, as having been burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters,

16. and having in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth is going forth a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance like the sun shines in his strength.

17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man; and he laid his right hand on me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last:

18. the living one, and I was dead; and, behold, I am alive unto the ages of the ages, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.

19. Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these;

20. and the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven golden candlesticks are the seven churches. 

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel who is in the church at Ephesus write; The one holding the seven stars in his right hand, the one walking about in the midst of the golden candlesticks, says these things;

2. I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and that you are not able to bear the wicked; and you have tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them to be liars:

3. and you have patience and have borne with them for my name's sake, and have not fainted.

4. But I have something against you, because you have left your first love.

5. Remember therefore whence you have fallen, and repent, and do your first works; lest I come to you, and shall move your candlestick out of its place, if you do not repent.

6. But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches; to him who conquers I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.

8. And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; The first and the last, who was dead, and is alive, says these things:

9. I know your tribulations, and your poverty, but you are rich; and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

10. Fear not those things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you a crown of life.

11. Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches; The one conquering can never be hurt by the second death.

12. To the angel of the church in Pergamum write; The one having the sharp, two-edged sword says these things;

13. I know where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is: and you are holding fast my name, and did not deny my faith, in the days when Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.

14. But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there those holding the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, and to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.

15. So you also have those in a similar manner holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

16. Repent; otherwise I am coming to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

17. Let the one having ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches; unto the one conquering will I give to him of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone my new name having been written, which no one knows but the one receiving it.

18. And to the angel of the church among the Thyatireans write; The Son of God, the one having eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like burnished brass, says these things;

19. I know your works, and your divine love, and faith, and ministry, and patience, and your works: the last more than the first.

20. But I have it against you, that you suffer the woman Jezebel, who says herself to be a prophet, and teaches and deceives my servants to commit fornication, and to cat things sacrificed to idols.

21. And I gave her time that she might repent, and she does not wish to repent of her fornication.

22. Behold, I cast her on a bed, and those who commit fornication along with her into great tribulation, until they shall repent of her works.

23. And I will slay her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am the one searching the reins and the hearts: and I will give to you each according to your works.

24. But I say to you, the rest who are among the Thyatireans, so many as have not this teaching, whosoever have not known the depth of Satan, as they say; I cast upon you no other burden.

25. Moreover hold fast that which you have, until I shall come.

26. And the one conquering and holding my works until the end, I will give unto him authority over the nations:

27. and he will shepherdize them with an iron rod: as the potter's vessels are broken to pieces; as I have received of my Father:

28. and I will give unto him the morning star.

29. Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. 

## Revelation 3

1. And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; The one having the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars, says these things; I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and are dead.

2. Be you watchful, and strengthen the remaining things, which are about to die. For I have not found your works perfect before my God.

3. Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If you do not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come upon you.

4. But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: because they are worthy.

5. The one conquering shall thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and in the presence of his angels.

6. Let the one having ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; The holy, true one, the one having the key of David, the one opening, and no one shall shut; and the one shutting, and no one shall open; says these things.

8. I know your works; behold, I have given before you an open door, which no one is able to shut: and you have a little power, and you have kept my word, and not denied my name.

9. Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are lying; behold, I will make them that they shall come and worship before thy feet, and may know that I have loved thee with divine love.

10. Because you have kept the word of my patience, and I will keep you from the hour of temptation, which is about to come upon the whole world, to try those dwelling upon the earth.

11. I am coming quickly: hold fast that which you have, that no one may take your crown.

12. The one conquering, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God: and my new name.

13. Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

14. And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write; The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, says these things;

15. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were either cold or hot.

16. Thus because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.

17. Because you are saying, That I am rich, and have increased in riches, and have need as to nothing, and do you not know that you are miserable, and pitiful, and poor, and blind, and naked?

18. I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been purified by the fire, in order that you may be rich; and white garments, in order that you may be clothed, and the shame of your nakedness may not be exposed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.

19. So many as I love, I rebuke and chastise; be zealous, and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door, and am knocking: if any one may hear my voice, and may open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

21. The one conquering, I will give unto him to sit with me on my throne, as I indeed have conquered, and sat down with my Father on his throne.

22. Let the one having ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches. 

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I saw, and behold, a door was opened in the heaven: and the first voice I heard was as of a trumpet speaking with me; saying; Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which it behooves to come to pass after these.

2. Immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in the heaven, and on the throne one sitting,

3. and the one sitting was in appearance like unto a jasper and a sardius stone: and a rainbow was around about the throne, in appearance like unto an emerald.

4. And around about the throne were twenty-four thrones: and on the thrones twenty-four elders are sitting, clothed in white garments; and upon their heads golden crowns.

5. And from the throne lightnings and voices and thunders are going out; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God:

6. and before the throne a glassy sea like crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, are four living creatures filled with eyes in front and in the rear.

7. And the first living creature was like unto a lion, and the second living creature was like unto a bullock, and the third living creature having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature was like unto a flying eagle.

8. And the four living creatures having six wings, one opposite one of them; filled with eyes without and within; and they cease not day and night, saying; Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Omnipotent, who was, and who is, and who is the one coming.

9. And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the one sitting upon the throne, who lives unto the ages of the ages,

10. the twenty-four elders will fall down before the one sitting upon the throne, and will worship Him who lives unto the ages of the ages, and will cast their crowns before the throne,

11. saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord truly our God, to receive glory and honor and power: because thou hast created all things, and through thy will they were, and were created. 

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw upon the right hand of the one sitting upon the throne a book having been written within and without, having been sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a mighty angel crying with a great voice, Who is able to open the book, and to loose its seals?

3. And no one in the heaven, nor upon the earth, nor beneath the earth, was able to open the book, and to look into it.

4. And I was weeping much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look into it.

5. And one of the elders says to me; Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered to open the book, and the seven seals.

6. And I saw, in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, the Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God having been sent into all the earth.

7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of the one sitting upon the throne.

8. And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having each a harp, and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to receive the book, and to open its seals: because thou wast slain, and didst with thy blood redeem unto God out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;

10. and didst make them a kingdom and priests unto our God: and they shall reign on the earth.

11. And I saw, and I heard as it were a voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders: and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;

12. saying with a great voice; Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing.

13. And I heard all creation, which is in the heaven, and upon the earth, and beneath the earth, and in the sea, and all things which are in them, indeed saying, to the one sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion, unto the ages of the ages.

14. And the four living creatures continued to say, Amen. And the elders fell and worshiped. 

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures speaking, like a voice of thunder, Come.

2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse: and the one sitting on him having a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and that he might conquer.

3. And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.

4. And there went out a red horse: and to him sitting on him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they shall slay one another: and a great sword was given him.

5. And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw; and behold a black horse; and the one sitting on him having a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a denarion, and three measures of barley for a denarion; and hurt not the oil and the wine.

7. And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.

8. And I saw, and behold a livid horse: and the one sitting on him, to him the name was Death, and Hades followed along with him: and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to slay with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the earth.

9. And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw beneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain on account of the word of God, and the testimony which they had.

10. And they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood from those who dwell upon the earth?

11. And a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them, that they should wait a little while, until their fellow-servants and brethren, who are about to be slain as they were should be fulfilled.

12. And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the full moon became like blood;

13. and the stars of the heaven fell upon the earth, as a fig-tree casting her unripe figs, when shaken by a mighty wind;

14. and the heaven rolled away as a book is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the mighty men, and the chiliarchs, and the rich men, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,

16. and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the one sitting upon the throne, and the wrath of the Lamb:

17. because the great day of their wrath has come; and who is able to stand? 

## Revelation 7

1. And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor the sea, nor upon any tree.

2. And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given unto them to hurt the earth and the sea,

3. saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we may seal the servants of our God in their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of the sealed ones: a hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel?

5. Out of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;

6. of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Napthali, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;

7. of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;

8. of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

9. After these things I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no one was able to number, out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands;

10. and they are crying with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God, the one sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb.

11. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and fell down before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God,

12. saying, Amen: blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and strength, to our God unto the ages of the ages: Amen.

13. And one of the elders responded, to me saying, Who are these who are clothed in white robes, and whence came they?

14. And I said unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me; These are those coming up out of great tribulation, who have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. On account of this they are before the throne of God, and they worship him day and night in his temple, and the one sitting upon the throne will spread his tabernacle over them.

16. And they will never hunger or thirst any more; neither will the sun, or any heat, fall on them:

17. because the Lamb in the midst of the throne will shepherdize them, and guide them to the fountains of the waters of life; and God will wipe every tear out of their eyes. 

## Revelation 8

1. And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and seven trumpets were given unto them.

3. And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he shall offer with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incense went up out of the hand of the angel, with the prayers of the saints, before God.

5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it to the earth: and there were thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels, those having the seven trumpets, prepared themselves that they should sound.

7. And the first sounded, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and cast to the earth: and the third of the earth was burnt up, and the third of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;

9. and the third of the creatures which were in the sea, those having life, died; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.

10. And the third angel sounded; and a great star, burning like a lamp, fell from the heaven, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters.

11. And the name of the star is called Apsinth. And the third part of the waters became apsinth; and many of the men died from the waters, because they were bitter.

12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, were smitten; and the third part of them was darkened, and the day did not shine the third part of it, and likewise the night.

13. And I saw, and I heard one eagle flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice; Woe, woe, woe, to those dwelling upon the earth, on account of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are about to sound. 

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel sounded; and I saw a star having fallen from the heaven to the earth; and the key of the pit of the abyss was given to him.

2. And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke came out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit.

3. And locusts came out of the smoke into the earth: and power was given unto them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

4. And it was said to them that they shall not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; only the men who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads.

5. And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he may strike a man.

6. And in those days men will seek death, and will not find it; and they will desire to die, and death flies from them.

7. And the shapes of the locusts are like horses having been made ready for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like gold, and their faces are like the faces of men.

8. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.

9. And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses rushing to war.

10. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings: and their power is in their tails, to hurt men five months:

11. and they have over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit, to him the name is Abaddon in Hebrew, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.

12. One Woe is past; behold two Woes come yet after these things.

13. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,

14. saying to the sixth angel the one having the trumpet, Loose the four angels which have been bound at the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, that they should slay the third part of the men.

16. And the number of the armies of the cavalry was two myriads of myriads: I heard the number of them.

17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates as of fire, and of hyacinth, and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as of the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceeds fire and smoke and brimstone.

18. And from these three plagues the third of the men were slain, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, coming out of their mouth.

19. For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt.

20. And the rest of the men who were not slain by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood; which are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk:

21. and they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the heaven, encircled with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire:

2. and having in his hand a little open book. And he placed his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth,

3. and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices.

4. And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice speaking from the heaven, Seal those things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not.

5. And the angel, which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven,

6. and he swore by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, who created the heaven, and the things in it, and the earth, and the things in it, and the sea, and the things in it, that there shall be time no longer:

7. but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, and the mystery of God may be finished, when he has preached the gospel to his servants the prophets.

8. And the voice which I heard from the heaven again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book which is open in the hands of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land.

9. And I went away to the angel, saying to him, to give me the little book. He says to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.

10. And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and I ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I ate it, my stomach was bitter.

11. And they say to me, It behooves you again to prophesy before the many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. 

## Revelation 11

1. And a reed like a rod was given unto me: saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those worshiping in it.

2. And the outer court of the temple leave out, and measure it not; because it is given to the Gentiles: and they will tread down the holy city forty-two months.

3. And I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks which are standing before the Lord of the earth.

5. And if any one wishes to hurt them, fire goes forth out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any one wishes to hurt them, thus it behooves him to be killed.

6. They have power to shut up the heaven, that the rain may not fall during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, so often as they may wish.

7. And when they may finish their testimony, the beast which ascends up out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, and conquer them, and slay them.

8. And their dead body will lie in the street of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where the Lord also was crucified.

9. And those of the peoples and of tribes and of the tongues and of the nations see their dead body three days and a half, and do not suffer their bodies to be put in a sepulchre.

10. And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry, and send gifts to one another; because these prophets tormented those dwelling upon the earth.

11. And after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell on those seeing them.

12. And they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, Come up hither; and they ascended up into the heaven in a cloud; and their enemies saw them.

13. And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city fell, and there were killed by the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of the heaven.

14. The second Woe is passed; behold, the third woe comes quickly.

15. And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and his Christ; and he will reign until the ages of the ages.

16. And the twenty-four elders, who are before God, who sit upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,

17. saying, We praise thee, O Lord God Omnipotent who is, and who was; and that thou hast received thy great power, and reigned.

18. And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath has come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy name, to the small and to the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.

19. And the temple of God was opened in the heaven and the ark of His covenant was seen in his temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and earthquakes, and a great hail. 

## Revelation 12

1. And there was a great sign in the heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;

2. and being in gestation, she also cries, travailing in pain, and suffering to bring forth.

3. And there appeared another sign in the heaven; and behold the great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems:

4. and his tail draws the third of the stars of the heaven, and casts them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, in order that he may eat up her child when she may bring it forth.

5. And she brought forth a male son, who is about to shepherdize all the nations with an iron rod: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place prepared of God, that they may there nourish her a thousand and two hundred and sixty days.

7. And there was war in the heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.

8. And the dragon and his angels fought, and they did not prevail; neither was their place found any more in the heaven.

9. And the great dragon, the old serpent, the one called the devil, and Satan, the one deceiving the whole world, was cast out: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying, Now has come salvation, and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren, the one accusing them before our God day and night, is cast out.

11. And they conquered him through the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their testimony; and with divine love they love not their life unto death.

12. Therefore rejoice, O ye heavens, and those dwelling in them; woe unto the earth and the sea! because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast out into the earth, he persecuted the woman, who brought forth the male child.

14. And the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly away into the wilderness, into her own place, where she is there nourished a time, and times, and a half time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.

16. And the earth helped the woman; and the earth opened her mouth, and drank up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus. 

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads; and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.

2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of lions: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.

3. And I saw one of his heads as it had been smitten unto death; and the wound of his death was healed. And the whole earth wondered after the beast:

4. and they worshiped the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying; Who is like the beast? and who is able to make war with him?

5. and a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemies; and authority was given unto him to prevail forty-two months.

6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, those dwelling in the heaven.

7. And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to conquer them: and authority was given unto him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.

8. And all those who dwell upon the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world, will worship him.

9. if any one has ears, let him hear.

10. If any one leads into captivity he goes into captivity: if any one kills with a sword, it behooves him to be killed with a sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he continued to speak as the dragon.

12. And he exercises all the authority of the first beast before him. And he makes the earth and those dwelling in it, that they shall worship the first beast, whose wound of his death was healed.

13. And he performs great signs, so that he can indeed make fire descend out of the heaven to the earth in presence of the people.

14. And he deceives those dwelling upon the earth through the signs which it was given unto him to perform in the presence of the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, who had the wound of the sword, and did live.

15. And it was given unto him to give spirit to the image of the beast, in order that the image of the beast may indeed speak, and he may cause so many as will not worship the image of the beast that they should be killed.

16. And he causes all, small and great, both rich and poor, both free and bond, that they may give them a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead:

17. that no one may be able to buy or sell, except the one having the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

18. Here is wisdom. Let the one having understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man. And his is, Six hundred and sixty-six. 

## Revelation 14

1. And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder: and the sound which I heard was as the sound of harpers harping with their harps:

3. and they are singing a new song before the throne, and in presence of the four living creatures, and the elders. And no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been redeemed from the earth.

4. These are they who have not been defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he may go. They have been redeemed from men, the first fruit unto God and the Lamb.

5. And in their mouth no lie is found: for they are blameless.

6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven having the eternal gospel to preach to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,

7. saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; because the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of the waters.

8. And another second angel followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has made all the nation to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

9. And another, the third angel followed these, saying with a great voice, If any one worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,

10. and he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, having been poured out without mixture in the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment, ascends up into ages of ages: and they have no rest day and night, who worship the beast and his image, and if any one receives the mark of his name.

12. Here is the faith of the saints: who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from the heaven saying, Write; Blessed are the dead immediately, who die in the Lord. Yea, says the Spirit, that they shall rest from their labors; for their works do follow along with them.

14. And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a great voice to the one sitting on the cloud, Send forth your sickle, and reap: because the hour of reaping has come; because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.

16. And the one sitting on the cloud thrust in his sickle to the earth; and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, himself also having a sharp sickle:

18. and another angel came out from the altar, having power over the fire; and he called with a great voice to the one having the sharp sickle, Send in thy sharp sickle, and reap the clusters of the vintage of the earth; because her grapes are fully ripe.

19. And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and reaped the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.

20. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out from the winepress, unto the trappings of the horses, one thousand and six hundred furlongs. 

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last plagues; that in them the wrath of God is finished.

2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and those who conquer from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

3. And they are singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Omnipotent; true and righteous are thy ways, thou King of the nations:

4. Who may not fear, O Lord, and will not glorify thy name? because thou alone art holy; because all the nations shall come and worship before thee; because thy righteous acts have been made manifest.

5. And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven was open:

6. and the seven angels, having the seven plagues, came out from the temple, clothed in clean, bright linen, and encircled about the breast with golden girdles.

7. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who liveth unto the ages of the ages.

8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels may be finished. 

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth.

2. and the first went away, and poured out his bowl upon the earth. And a destructive and grievous sore came on the men having the mark of the beast, and those worshiping his image.

3. And the second poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became as it were the blood of a dead man: and every soul of life died, whatsoever were in the sea.

4. And the third poured out his bowl upon the rivers and fountains of the waters; and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Thou art worthy, who is, and who was, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things;

6. because they shed the blood of saints and of prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; they are worthy.

7. And I heard one speaking from the altar, Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

8. And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto him to scorch the people with fire.

9. And the people were scorched with a great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, Who has power over these plagues: and they did not repent to give him glory.

10. And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was filled with darkness; and they gnawed their tongues from the pain,

11. and they blasphemed the God of the heavens on account of their pains and on account of their sores, and did not repent of their works.

12. And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and his water was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be prepared.

13. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet;

14. for these are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the whole earth, to lead them together into the war of the great day of God Almighty.

15. Behold, I am coming as a thief; blessed is the one watching and keeping his garments, in order that he may not walk about naked, and they may see his shame.

16. And he led them into the place called Har-Mageden in the Hebrew.

17. And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and a great voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done.

18. And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not from the time man was upon the earth, such was so great an earthquake.

19. And the great city was divided into three parts, and cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the wrath of his indignation.

20. And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.

21. And great hail like a talent comes down from the heaven upon the people; and the people blasphemed God, on account of the plague of the hail; because the plague of it was exceedingly great. 

## Revelation 17

1. And one of the seven angels having the seven bowls, came and spoke with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot, the one sitting upon many waters:

2. with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and those dwelling upon the earth were made drunk from the wine of her fornication.

3. And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, having the names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication:

5. and upon her forehead her name was written; Mystery, Babylon The Great, The Mother of Harlots And The Abominations of The Earth.

6. And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and seeing her, I was astonished with great astonishment.

7. And the angel said to me, Wherefore wast thou astonished? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carries her, having the seven heads and ten horns.

8. The beast which you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and go into perdition: and those dwelling upon the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished, seeing the beast, because he was, and is not, and will be.

9. Here is a mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sits upon them,

10. and there are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, and another is not yet come; and when he may come it behooves him to remain a little while.

11. The beast which was, and is not, and the same is the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going into perdition.

12. And the ten horns which you saw, are ten kings, who live not yet received a kingdom; but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.

13. These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.

14. These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall conquer them, because he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings: and with him are the called, and the elect, and the faithful.

15. And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire;

17. for God has given it into their hearts to do his mind, and to have one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

18. And the woman whom you saw is the great city, the one having dominion over the kings of the earth. 

## Revelation 18

1. After these things I saw another angel coming down out of the heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lighted with his glory.

2. And he cried with a strong voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and has become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and the den of every unclean and hateful bird;

3. because all nations have fallen of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich from the costliness of her delicacy.

4. And I heard another voice out of the heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, in order that you may not partake of her sins, and in order that you may not receive of her plagues;

5. because her sins have mounted up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.

6. Give unto her as indeed she has given, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she mixed, mix unto her double:

7. as to so many things as she has glorified herself, and lived wantonly, give unto her so much torment and sorrow. Because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow; and I see no sorrow;

8. therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burnt up with fire: because God, the one judging her, is a mighty Lord.

9. And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication with her, and lived wantonly, will weep and wail over her, when they may see the smoke of her burning,

10. and standing afar off on account of the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, the strong city, Babylon! because in one hour thy judgment came.

11. And the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her; because no one any longer buys their merchandise:

12. their merchandise of gold, and of silver, and of precious stones, and of pearls, and of fine linen; and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most valuable wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble;

13. and cinnamon, and amomum, and incense, and myrrh, and libation, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and bodies and souls of men;

14. and the fruit of thy soul's inordinate desire has departed from thee; and all things bright and shining have perished from thee, and they will no longer find them.

15. The merchants of these things, who have grown rich from her, will stand a long way off on account of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;

16. saying, Alas, alas, the great city, clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearl! because in one hour so great riches have come to desolation.

17. And every pilot, and every one sailing to the place, both the sailors and so many as traverse the sea, stood a long way off,

18. and they continued to cry seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, Who is like unto the great city?

19. And they continued to cast dust upon their heads, and cry, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, in which all those having ships in the sea became rich from her costliness! that in one hour she is made desolate.

20. Rejoice over her, O heaven, and the saints, and the apostles, and the prophets; because God has judged your judgment from her.

21. And one strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon the great city, be cast down, and can be found no more.

22. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and flute-players, and trumpeters, shall no more be heard in thee; and every artificer of every art shall no more be found in thee; and the sound of the mill shall no longer be heard in thee;

23. and the light of a candle shall no more shine in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall no longer be heard in thee: because thy merchants were the great men of the earth; because by thy sorcery all nations were deceived,

24. truly in her is found the blood of prophets, and saints, and all those who have been slain upon the earth. 

## Revelation 19

1. After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a vast multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation, and glary, and power, belong to our God:

2. because his judgments are true and righteous; because he has judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth by her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his servants from her hand.

3. And a second time they said, Hallelujah! and her smoke is going up unto the ages of the ages.

4. And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sitteth upon the throne, saying Amen; Hallelujah!

5. And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, ye who fear him, small and great.

6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! because the Lord our God Omnipotent reigned.

7. Let us rejoice and be glad, and give glory to him! because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.

8. And it was given unto her that she should be clothed in linen, bright and clean. For the linen is the righteous acts of the saints.

9. And he says to me, Write, Blessed are they who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And He says to me, These are the true words of God.

10. And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he says to me; See that you do it not: I am your fellow-servant, and one of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

11. And I saw the heaven open, and behold a white horse; and one sitting on him called, Faithful and True, in righteousness he both judges and wages war.

12. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems; having a name written, which no one knows, but himself,

13. and being clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name has been called, The Word of God.

14. Armies in the heaven follow him on white horses, clothed in linen, white and clean.

15. And out of his mouth goes forth a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations; and he will shepherdize them with an iron rod: and he treads the winepress of the wrath of the indignation of God Almighty.

16. And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.

17. And I saw one angel standing on the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds which fly in the midst of heaven, Come, gather yourselves to the great banquet of God;

18. in order that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chiliarchs, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all free men and slaves also, both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, assembled to make war with the one sitting on the horse, and with his army.

20. And the beast, and the false prophet along with him, who wrought miracles in his presence, by which he deceived those having received the mark of the beast, and those worshiping his image; and the two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.

21. And the rest were slain with the sword proceeding out from the mouth of him, the one sitting on the horse: and all the birds were filled with their flesh. 

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain on his hand.

2. And he laid hold on the dragon, who is the old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

3. and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and put his seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years may be fulfilled: after these it behooves him to be loosed a little season.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God, who did not worship the beast, nor his image, and they did not receive his mark on their forehead, and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

5. The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years were fulfilled. This is the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy is the one having part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years may be fulfilled, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

8. and he will go forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of them being as the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed about the camp of the saints, even the city which is beloved: and fire came down out of the heaven, and devoured them;

10. and the devil, the one deceiving them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also, and they shall be tormented day and night unto the ages of the ages.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and him sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

12. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead who are in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them; and they were judged each according to their works.

14. And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

15. And if any one was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire. 

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth passed away; and the sea is no more.

2. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride is adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a great voice speaking from the throne, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with the people, and he will tabernacle with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them:

4. and he will wipe every tear out of their eyes; and there will be no more death, neither will there be any more sorrow, nor crying, nor pain: because the former things have passed away.

5. And the one sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says, Write: that these words are faithful and true.

6. And he said to me, They are done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.

7. The one conquering shall inherit all things; and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me a son.

8. But to the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and the murderers, and the fornicators, and the sorcerers, and the idolaters, and all liars, shall be their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

9. And one of the seven angels having the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.

10. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,

11. having the glory of God: and her light was like a stone most precious, as a crystalline, jasper stone;

12. having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written upon them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. From the east, three gates; and from the north, three gates; and from the south, three gates; and from the west, three gates.

14. And the wall of the city having twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And the one speaking with me, had a measure, a golden reed, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.

16. And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; and the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.

17. And he measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of the man, that is of the angel.

18. And the building of the wall was jasper: and the city pure gold, like transparent glass.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedon; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx;

20. the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

21. The twelve gates are twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl. And the street of the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, is its temple.

23. And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may light it:

24. and the nations will walk about through its light: and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.

25. And the gates of it shall in no wise be shut in the day, for there will be no night there;

26. and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.

27. And nothing unclean, and the one doing abomination, and falsehood, can at all enter into it: none except those who are written in the Lamb's book of life. 

## Revelation 22

1. And he shewed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out from the throne of God and the Lamb.

2. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, is the tree of life, producing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

3. And there shall be no more curse. And the throne of God and the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

4. and they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.

5. And there shall be no more night; and they have no need of the light of a candle, nor the light of the sun; because the Lord God shines on them: and they shall reign until the ages of the ages.

6. And he said to me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his servants the things which it behooves quickly to come to pass.

7. Behold, I indeed am coming quickly. Blessed is the one keeping the words of the prophecy of this book.

8. And I John am the one seeing and hearing these things; and when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel, the one showing me these things.

9. And he says to me, See that you do it not: I am your fellow-servant, and one of your brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this book: worship God.

10. And he says to me; Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the season is nigh.

11. Let the unrighteous one still continue to do injustice; and let the filthy one still be filthy; and let the righteous one still do righteousness; and let the holy one still be sanctified.

12. Behold, I am coming quickly; and my reward is with me, to give unto each one as his work is.

14. Happy are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city.

15. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and harlots, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one doing and loving falsehood.

16. I Jesus sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning-star.

18. I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this book. If any one may add to these things, God will add unto him the plagues which are written in this book:

19. and if any one may take from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take his part from the tree of life, and from the holy city, from the things which are written in this book.

20. The one testifying these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly. Amen, come Lord Jesus.

21. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all.
