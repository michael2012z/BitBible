# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1. Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one having blessed us with all spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ:

4. as he elected us in himself before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless in his presence.

5. in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of sons unto himself through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,

6. unto the praise of the glory of his grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved:

7. in whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of transgressions, according to the riches of his grace,

8. which he has abounded unto us in all wisdom and understanding,

9. having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his own good pleasure, which he purposed in himself

10. in the economy of the fulness of the times, to rehead all things in Christ, those in the heavens, and those upon the earth; in him,

11. in whom we were also chosen by lot, having been predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things within us according to the counsel of his own will;

12. that we should be unto the praise of his glory, who first exercised hope in Christ:

13. in whom you also, having heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom, also having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,

14. who is the earnest of our salvation, unto the redemption of the possession, unto the praise of his glory.

15. Therefore I also, having heard of the faith among you in the Lord Jesus, and your love which is toward all the saints,

16. I do not cease giving thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers;

17. in order that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may grant unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the perfect knowledge of himself;

18. the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance among the saints,

19. and what the excellent majesty of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of the power of his might

20. which he has wrought in Christ, raising him from the dead, and seating him on his right hand in the heavenlies,

21. above all government, and authority, and power, and lordship, and every name named, not only in this age, but in the age to come:

22. and has subordinated all things beneath his feet, and given him to be head over all things to the church,

23. which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all things in all. 

## Ephesians 2

1. You, who were dead in trespasses and in your sins,

2. in which at one time you walked about according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit which is now working in the sons of disobedience;

3. among whom we all indeed at one time lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and of the thoughts, and we were by nature the children of wrath, like the rest also:

4. but God, being rich in mercy, on account of his great love with which he loved us,

5. created life in us in Christ, who were dead in trespasses, by grace you have been saved,

6. and he has raised you up, and caused you to sit in the heavenlies, in Christ Jesus:

7. in order that he may show in coming ages the superabounding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

8. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9. not of works, in order that no one may boast:

10. for we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them.

11. Therefore remember, that when you were Gentiles in the flesh, called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, made in the flesh with hands;

12. because you were at that time without Christ, being alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers of the covenants of the promise, having no hope and being atheists in the world.

13. But now you are in Christ Jesus, who being at one time far off have been made nigh by the blood of Christ.

14. For he is our peace, the one having made both one, and having broken down the middle wall of partition,

15. having destroyed the law of commandments in ordinances, through his flesh, the enmity, in order that He might create the two in himself into one new man, making peace;

16. and that he may reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity on in.

17. And having come he preached the gospel of peace to you, who were far away, and peace to them who were nigh:

18. because through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

19. Then therefore you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and members of the household of God,

20. having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone,

21. in whom the entire edifice, being assimilated, increases into a holy temple in the Lord;

22. in whom also you are built together into a habitation of God in the Spirit. 

## Ephesians 3

1. Therefore I Paul, the prisoner of Christ for the sake of you Gentiles,

2. if indeed you have heard the economy of the grace of God which is given to me unto you;

3. that according to revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I formerly wrote to you briefly,

4. according to which you, reading, are able to know my understanding in the mystery of Christ;

5. which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit;

6. that the Gentiles are to be fellow-heirs, and the same body, and partakers of the promise of Christ Jesus through the gospel,

7. whose minister I became, according to the gift of the grace of God which was given unto me; according to the working of his power.

8. To me, the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

9. and to shine forth what is the economy of the mystery which has been hidden from the ages in God who created all things;

10. in order that the manifold wisdom of God through the church, may now be made known to the governments and authorities in the heavenlies,

11. according to the purpose of the ages which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord.

12. In whom we have boldness and access with confidence through the faith of him.

13. Therefore I ask that you faint not in my tribulations in your behalf, which is your glory.

14. For this cause I bow my knees to the Father,

15. of whom the whole family in heavens and upon earth is named,

16. in order that he may grant unto you, according to the riches of his glory, that you be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

17. that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;

18. being rooted and grounded in divine love, in order that you may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height,

19. and to know the divine love of Christ which transcends knowledge, in order that you may be filled with all the fulness of God.

20. And to him who is able to do exceedingly above all things which we ask or think, according to the power working in us,

21. to him be glory in the church indeed in Christ Jesus unto all the generations of the age of the ages: Amen. 

## Ephesians 4

1. Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to walk worthily of the calling with which you are called,

2. with all humility and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in divine love;

3. endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

4. There is one body and one Spirit, as ye indeed are called in one hope of your calling;

5. one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6. one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and above you all, and in all.

7. And to each one of you grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

8. Therefore he says, Having ascended upon high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to the people.

9. But what is that which ascended, except that which descended into the lower parts of the earth?

10. But the one having descended and the one having ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things, is the same.

11. And he gave some, apostles; some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

12. unto the perfection of the saints, in the work of the ministry, in the edification of the body of Christ:

13. until we may all come into the unity of the faith, and of the perfect knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect man, into the measure of the likeness of the fulness of Christ:

14. in order that we may be no longer infants, tossed by the waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, in the caprice of the people, in their craftiness, pursuant to their method of delusion;

15. but speaking the truth in divine love, let its grow up in him in all things, who is the head, Christ;

16. from whom the whole body, being assimilated and knitted together through every joint of the supply, according to the working in each several part, makes increase of the body in the edification of itself in divine love.

17. Therefore I say this, and witness in the Lord, that you no longer walk about as the Gentiles also walk about in the vanity of their mind,

18. being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance being in themselves, on account of the blindness of their heart;

19. who being past feeling have given themselves up to debauchery, unto the working of all impurity with greediness.

20. But you did not so learn Christ:

21. if indeed ye have heard him, and been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:

22. that with reference to your former life, you are to lay aside the old man, who is corrupt in the lusts of deception;

23. and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,

24. and to put on the new man, who has been created in harmony with God in the righteousness and holiness of the truth.

25. Therefore, having laid aside lying, speak the truth each one with his neighbors: because we are members of one another.

26. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your provocation:

27. neither give place to the devil.

28. Let the one stealing steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his own hands doing that which is good, that he may have to give to the one having need.

29. Let no corrupt communication go forth out of your mouth, but if anything is good unto edification of need, in order that he may give grace to those who hear.

30. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.

31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and blasphemy, depart from you, with all evil.

32. But be ye kind toward one another, merciful, forgiving one another, as indeed God in Christ forgave you. 

## Ephesians 5

1. Therefore be ye imitators of God, as beloved children;

2. and walk about in divine love, as Christ also loved you, and gave himself for you, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweet savor.

3. But all fornication, and uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be named among you, as it becomes saints;

4. and indecorum, or foolish talking, or indecent jesting, which is not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks:

5. for you are knowing this, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

6. Let no one deceive you with empty words: for through these the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.

7. Therefore be not partakers along with them.

8. For at one time ye were darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord: walk about as children of the light,

9. (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),

10. proving what is acceptable to the Lord;

11. and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather indeed convict them.

12. For it is disgraceful even to speak of those things which are done by them in concealment:

13. but all things being convicted by the light are made manifest; for everything made manifest is light.

14. Therefore he says, Awake, thou sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon thee.

15. Therefore see how you walk about circumspectly, not as unwise, but wise;

16. buying in the opportunity, because the days are evil.

17. Therefore be not unwise, but understand whatsoever is the will of the Lord.

18. Be not drunk with wine, in which there is riot, but be ye filled with the Spirit;

19. speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,

20. always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;

21. being submissive to one another in the fear of Christ.

22. Wives, be submissive to your own husbands, as to the Lord,

23. because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is also the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.

24. But as the church is submissive to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in everything.

25. Husbands, love your wives with divine love, as Christ also loved the church with divine love, and gave himself for her;

26. in order that he might sanctify her, having purified her by the washing of water through the word,

27. in order that he might present to himself the glorious church, having not spot or wrinkle or any of such things; but that she might be holy and blameless.

28. So the husbands ought to love their own wives with divine love as their own bodies. The one loving his own wife is loving himself:

29. for no one ever yet hated his own flesh; but he nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also the church;

30. because we are members of his body:

31. on account of this a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife: and they two shall be one flesh.

32. This is a great mystery: but I speak in reference to Christ and the church.

33. Moreover you also each one thus love his own wife with divine love as himself; and that the wife also reverence the husband. 

## Ephesians 6

1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

2. Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise,

3. that it may be well with you, and you may live long upon the earth.

4. And fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

5. Ye servants, obey those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in purity of your heart, as unto Christ;

6. not with eyeservice, as menpleasers, but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the soul;

7. serving with good will as the Lord, and not men:

8. knowing that if each one may do good, he will receive this with the Lord, whether bond or free.

9. And, ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that their Master and yours is in the heavens, and that there is no respect of persons with him.

10. Finally, be filled up with dynamite in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

11. Put on the panoply of God, that you may be able to stand against the methods of the devil,

12. because there is not to us fighting against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the heavenlies.

13. Therefore take the panoply of God, that you may be able to stand in the evil day, and having done all things, to stand.

14. Stand therefore, being girded about as to your loins with truth, and being invested with the breastplate of righteousness,

15. and being shod as to your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

16. in all things taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.

17. And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

18. praying with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit in every place, and watching unto this same thing in all perseverance and prayer for all the saints,

19. and for me that the word may be given unto me in opening of my mouth, boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,

20. for which I am an ambassador in chain; in order that in it I may preach boldly, as it behooves me to speak.

21. But in order that you may also know the things concerning me, how I am doing, Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you:

22. whom I sent to you unto this same thing, in order that you may know the affairs concerning us, and he may comfort your hearts.

23. Peace and divine love to the brethren, with faith, from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

24. Grace be with all who love the Lord Jesus Christ with divine love in purity.
