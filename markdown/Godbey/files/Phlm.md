# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, and brother Timothy, to Philemon the beloved also our fellow-laborer,

2. and to sister Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church in your house.

3. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I give thanks to my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,

5. hearing about your divine love, and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and all the saints;

6. in order that the fellowship of your faith may be efficient in the perfect knowledge of every good thing which is in you toward Christ.

7. For I had much joy and consolation over your divine love, because the affections of the saints have been refreshed by you, O brother.

8. Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to command you to that which is appropriate,

9. on account of the divine love, I the more exhort you, being such as Paul the aged, and now also the prisoner of Jesus Christ.

10. I exhort you concerning my son, whom I begat in my bonds, Onesimus,

11. him at one time unprofitable to you, but now profitable both to you and to me: whom I have sent back to you,

12. him, that is my own heart.

13. Whom I did wish to have with me, in order that he might minister unto me in your stead in the bonds of the gospel:

14. but without your consent I did not wish to do anything; in order that your good might not be by constraint, but by the free will:

15. for on this account he suddenly departed from you for an hour, that you might have him back forever;

16. no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, and much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord:

17. if then you have me a comrade, receive him as myself.

18. If he has wronged you as to anything, or owes you anything, charge this to me.

19. I Paul have written with my own hand, I will pay it: not that I may say to you that you even owe yourself to me.

20. Yea, brother, let me rejoice over you in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.

21. Having confidence in your obedience I have written to you, knowing that you will do even more than those things which I say.

22. And at the same time also prepare for me a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I will be consigned unto you.

23. Epaphras, my fellow-soldier in Christ Jesus;

24. Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers, salute you.

25. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
