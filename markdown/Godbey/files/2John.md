# 2 John

## 2 John 1

1. The elder to the elect Cyria, and to her children, whom in truth I love with divine love; and not I, but also those having known the truth;

2. on account of the truth which abides in us, and shall be with us forever.

3. Grace, mercy, peace, shall be with us from God our Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and in divine love.

4. I rejoice exceedingly because I have found some of thy children walking about in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.

5. And now I entreat thee, O Cyria, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another with divine love.

6. And this is the divine love, that we may walk about according to his commandments; this is the commandment, That, as you heard from the beginning, that you may walk about in it.

7. Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh; the same is the deceiver and the antichrist.

8. Take heed to yourselves, that you may not destroy those things which you have wrought, but may receive a full reward.

9. Every one going forth, and not abiding in the teaching of Christ, has not God; the one abiding in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.

10. If any one comes to you, and does not bring this doctrine; do not receive him into your house, and do not bid him God speed:

11. for the one bidding him God speed partakes of his evil deeds.

12. Having many things to write to you, I would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and mouth to mouth to speak to you, in order that our joy may be full.

13. The children of thy elect sister salute thee.
