# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as it is worthy, because your faith increases, and the divine love of each one of you all towards one another abounds more and more;

4. so that we ourselves rejoice over you in the churches of God, on account of your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which you endure;

5. the manifestation of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you indeed suffer:

6. if indeed it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them who are troubling you,

7. and to you who are troubled, rest with us, in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power

8. in the fire of flame, dispensing vengeance to those who know not God, and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus:

9. who shall suffer vengeance, eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,

10. when he may come to be glorified among his saints, and among all those who believe, to be wondered at in that day, because our testimony was believed by you.

11. Unto which indeed we are praying incessantly for you, in order that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and work of faith, with power;

12. in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and our Lord Jesus Christ. 

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. But we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering unto him;

2. that you be not suddenly shaken from your mind, nor disturbed, whether by a spirit, or through word, or a letter as by us, as that the day of the Lord has come.

3. Let no one deceive you in any way: because unless there may first be an apostasy and the man of lawlessness may be revealed, the son of perdition,

4. the one opposing and exalting himself above everything that is called God or divinity; so that he sits in the temple of God, showing himself off that he is God.

5. Do you not remember that still being with you, I told you these things?

6. And now you know that which hinders, that he should be revealed in his time.

7. For already the mystery of lawlessness is working: only there is one now hindering, until he may be taken out of the midst;

8. then indeed will the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will remove by the spirit of his mouth, and will exterminate by the brightness of his coming;

9. whose coming is according to the energy of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,

10. and in all the deception of unrighteousness to those who perish; because they did not receive the divine love of the truth, that they might be saved.

11. And on this account God sends to them the working of delusion, that they should believe a lie:

12. in order that they may all be condemned who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in unrighteousness.

13. But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth;

14. unto which He also called you through our gospel, unto the possession of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. Then therefore, brethren, stand, and hold fast the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or by our epistle:

16. and our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, the one having loved us and given eternal consolation and good hope through grace,

17. comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word. 

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Finally, brethren, pray for us in order that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, as even unto you:

2. and in order that we may be delivered from the ungodly and wicked men; for faith does not belong to all.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and keep you from the evil one.

4. And we have trusted in the Lord in your behalf, that you are doing, and will do whatsoever we command.

5. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and the patience of Christ.

6. And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks about disorderly, and not according to the teaching they received from us.

7. For you yourselves know how it behooves you to imitate us; because we were not disorderly among you;

8. neither did we eat bread with any one gratuitously, but with labor and toil, night and day working, that we might not burden any one of you:

9. not because we have not the right, but in order that we may give ourselves an example to you, that you may imitate us.

10. For indeed when we were with you, we proclaimed this to you, that if any one does not wish to work, let him not eat.

11. For we hear that there are certain ones walking about among you disorderly, doing nothing, but they are busybodies:

12. but we command such and exhort them in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietude working, they must eat their own bread.

13. But you, brethren, be not weary doing well.

14. But if any one does not obey our word through the epistle, note him; do not keep company with him; in order that he may be ashamed;

15. consider him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

16. The Lord of peace himself grant unto you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.

17. Salutation of me Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
