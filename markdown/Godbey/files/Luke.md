# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Inasmuch as many took it in hand to present a history concerning these things which have been fulfilled among us,

2. as those being eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word have delivered unto us;

3. it seemed good to me also, having followed carefully all things from the beginning, to write unto thee consecutively, O most noble Theophilus,

4. in order that thou mayest know the certainty of the words concerning which thou hast been instructed.

5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Ahijah, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.

7. And there was no child to them, as Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.

8. And it came to pass, while he was officiating in the order of his course before God,

9. (according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to offer incense), having gone into the temple of the Lord;

10. and all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense;

11. the angel of the Lord appeared unto him standing on the right hand of the altar of incense:

12. and Zacharias was troubled seeing him, and fear fell on him.

13. And the angel said to him; Fear not, Zacharias; because thy prayer has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bring forth a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name John.

14. And there shall be joy and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall not drink wine and strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from the womb of his mother.

16. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord, their God.

17. And he will go before Him in the spirit and Power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient unto the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people made ready for the Lord.

18. And Zacharias said to the angel: According to what shall I know this? for I am old and my wife advanced in her days.

19. And the angel responding said to him; I am Gabriel standing in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to you and to preach to you these things.

20. And behold thou shalt be dumb and unable to speak, unto the day upon which these things may take place; because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.

21. And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering because he tarries in the temple.

22. And having come out he was unable to speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was beckoning to them and remained dumb.

23. And it came to pass when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he went away to his own house.

24. And after these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,

25. That the Lord so hath done unto me, in the days in which He condescended to take away my reproach among men.

26. And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, to which was the name

27. Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man, to whom was the name Joseph of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.

28. And the angel having come to her said; Hail, thou blessed one; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women.

29. And she seeing was troubled over his word, and was reasoning what kind this salutation might be.

30. And the angel said to her; Fear not, Mary; for thou didst find favor with God.

31. And behold, thou shalt conceive and hear a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus.

32. He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David:

33. and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His Kingdom there shall be no end.

34. And Mary said to the angel; How shall this be, since I know not man?

35. And the angel responding said to her; The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore, indeed, that holy thing that is begotten shall be called the Son of God.

36. And behold Elizabeth thy kinswoman, indeed, herself having conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month, to her who is called barren.

37. Because no word shall be impossible with God.

38. And Mary said; Behold the handmaiden of the Lord; may it be done unto me according to thy word. And the angel went away from her.

39. And Mary, rising, departed into the mountainous land, with haste, into a city of Judah.

40. And she came into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; and she spoke with a loud voice and said;

42. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

43. And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord may come unto me?

44. For behold when the voice of your salutation came into my ears, the infant in my womb leaped with joy.

45. And blessed is she that believeth, because there shall be a perfection to those things having been spoken to her by the Lord.

46. And Mary said; My soul doth magnify the Lord,

47. and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,

48. because He looked upon the low state of his handmaiden.

49. For behold from now all generations call me blessed; because the Mighty One did great things unto me, and His name is holy;

50. and His mercy unto generation of generations to them that fear Him.

51. He wrought power by his own arm; he dispersed the proud in the thought of their heart.

52. He cast down the mighty from thrones and exalted the humble.

53. He filled the poor with good things, and sent away the rich empty.

54. He delivered his son Israel, to remember mercy,

55. as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever.

56. And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.

57. And the time of her parturition was fulfilled unto Elizabeth and she brought forth a son.

58. And the neighbors and her relatives heard, that the Lord was magnifying His mercy with her, and they continued to rejoice with her.

59. And it came to pass on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the little child; and they were calling him Zacharias, after the name of his father.

60. And his mother responding said; No, but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her; That there is no one among thy kindred who is called by this name.

62. And they were beckoning to his father, what he might wish to call him.

63. And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote saying; His name is John.

64. And all marveled. And his mouth immediately opened and his tongue loosed, and he continued to speak, praising God.

65. And fear came upon all of those dwelling around; and all these words were spoken abroad in all the mountainous regions of Judea.

66. And all those hearing placed them in their heart, saying; What then shall this little child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied saying;

68. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because He looked upon us and wrought redemption to His people, and raised up unto us a horn of salvation

69. in the house of David His son.

70. As he spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from the beginning;

71. salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all those who hate us,

72. to execute mercy with our fathers, and remember His holy covenant,

73. the oath which He swore to Abraham our father:

74. to grant unto us, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, to serve Him without fear,

75. in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.

76. And thou, little child, shall be called a prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,

77. to give knowledge of salvation to His people in remission of their sins,

78. through the bowels of mercy of our God, in which the dayspring from on high looked upon us,

79. to appear unto those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet in the way of peace.

80. And the little child continued to grow and waxed strong in spirit; and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel. 

## Luke 2

1. It came to pass in those days, a decree went out from Augustus Caesar, to enroll all the world.

2. This was the first enrollment, Cyrenius being governor of Syria.

3. And all were going forth to enroll, each one into his own city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city Nazareth, into Judea, into the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,

5. to enroll himself along with Mary, the wife having been betrothed to him, being in an advanced state of pregnancy.

6. And it came to pass while they were there the days of her parturition were fulfilled.

7. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

8. And the shepherds were in that country, tenting out and keeping guard over their flock by night.

9. And behold an angel of the Lord stood over them and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they feared with great fear.

10. And the angel said to them; Fear not; for behold, I preach unto you the gospel of great joy, which shall be to all people;

11. because this day a Savior is born unto you, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.

12. And this shall be the sign unto you; you shall find an infant lying in a manger, wrapped in swaddling clothes.

13. And immediately a multitude of the heavenly host was with the angel, praising God and saying;

14. Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth; good will among men.

15. And it came to pass, when the angels departed from them into heaven, indeed, the shepherds said to one another; Now let us go unto Bethlehem and see this word which has taken place, which the Lord made known to us.

16. They went making haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.

17. And seeing, they made known concerning the word which was spoken to them about this little child.

18. And all hearing wondered concerning the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.

19. And Mary kept all these words laying them up in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all things which they heard and saw, as it was spoken to them.

21. And when the eight days of circumcising Him were fulfilled, and His name was called Jesus, having been called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they carried him up into Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,

23. as it was written in the law of the Lord; That every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;

24. and to offer a sacrifice according to that which has been written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.

25. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and the same man was righteous and godly, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him;

26. and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord.

27. And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and while the parents are bringing in the little child Jesus, that they may do according to the provisions of law concerning Him,

28. he received Him into his arms and blessed God and said;

29. Now, O Lord, thou art letting thy servant depart, in peace according to thy word;

30. because mine eyes saw thy salvation,

31. which thou didst prepare before the face of all peoples;

32. a light unto the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

33. And His father and His mother were marveling at the words spoken concerning Him.

34. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, His mother; Behold, he is appointed unto the fall and rising of many in Israel, and unto a sign which is spoken against;

35. and a sword shall go through thy soul, in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And Anna was a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher, herself being advanced in many days, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity;

37. and she a widow of about fourscore years, who did not depart from the temple, worshiping night and day with fastings and prayers.

38. And she, at the same hour, standing up continued to praise the Lord, and speak concerning Him to all those awaiting the redemption in Jerusalem.

39. And when they finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee into their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child continued to grow and waxed strong in spirit, being full of wisdom; and the grace of God was on Him.

41. And His parents were going, according to custom, into Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.

42. And when He was twelve years old, they going up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,

43. and having completed the days, while they were returning the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem. And His parents knew it not.

44. And thinking that He is in the crowd, they came a day's journey, and were seeking Him among His relatives and acquaintances.

45. And not having found Him; they returned to Jerusalem seeking Him.

46. And it came to pass, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and asking them questions.

47. And all hearing Him were astonished at His wisdom and answers.

48. And seeing Him they were astonished, and His mother said to Him; Child, why did you thus do unto us? Behold, thy father and I were seeking thee, sorrowful.

49. And He said to them, Why were you seeking after me? Did you not know that it behooved me to be in the affairs of my Father?

50. And they did not understand the word which He spoke unto them.

51. And He went down with them and came to Nazareth; and was subject unto them. And His mother continued to keep all these words in her heart.

52. And Jesus continued to grow in wisdom and stature and favor with God and men. 

## Luke 3

1. And in the fifteenth year in the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituria and the Trachonitis country, and Lusanius tetrarch of Abilene, during the high-priesthood of Annas

2. and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3. And he came into all the region round about the Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto the remissions of sins,

4. as has been written in the book of Isaiah the prophet, saying; The voice of one roaring in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.

5. Every valley shall be filled up and every mountain and hill shall be cut down; and the crooked places shall be straight and the rough ways smooth.

6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

7. Then he said unto the multitudes coming out to be baptized by him; O generations of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves; We have Abraham our father.

9. But truly the ax is laid to the root of the trees; Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

10. And the multitudes asked him, saying; What then shall we do?

11. And responding he says to them, Let the one having two coats, give to him having none, and let the one having food do likewise.

12. And the publicans came also to be baptized, and said to him; Teacher, what shall we do!

13. And he said to them, Exact no more than that which has been appointed unto you.

14. And the soldiers were asking him saying; And what shall we do? And he said to them; Oppress no one, neither defraud; and be content with your wages.

15. And the people waiting and all reasoning in their hearts concerning John, lest he might be the Christ.

16. John responded to all, saying; I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh One more powerful than I, the latchet of His sandals I am not worthy to loose; He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.

17. Whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purify His threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into His garner, and will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

18. Then indeed exhorting them as to many other things he continued to preach the gospel to the people.

19. And Herod the tetrarch, being convicted by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, and concerning the wickedness which Herod did,

20. added also this to all, and shut up John in prison.

21. And it came to pass while all the people were being baptized, and Jesus having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

22. and the Holy Spirit in bodily appearance like a dove descended on Him; and there was a voice from heaven, saying; Thou art my beloved Son, I am delighted in Thee.

23. And Jesus was beginning to be about thirty years old, being as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,

24. Matthat, Levi, Melchi, Janna, Joseph:

25. Mattathios, Amos, Naum, Esli, Naggai,

26. Mattathios, Semei, Josech, Joda,

37. of Methusalah, Enoch, Jared, of Mahalaleel, Cainan,

38. of Enos, Seth, Adam, the Son of God. 

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus, full of the Holy Ghost, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, tempted by the devil forty days.

2. And He ate nothing during those days; and they having been completed, He afterward hungered.

3. And the devil said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, speak to this stone, in order that it may become bread.

4. And Jesus responded to him, saying; It has been written, That man shall not live upon bread alone, but upon every word of God.

5. And the devil leading Him up, he showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the devil said to Him, I will give all the authority and glories of these to thee: because it has been given unto me: and I give it to whom I may wish;

7. then if thou mayest worship before me all shall belong to thee.

8. And Jesus responding said to him; It has been written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.

9. And he led Him into Jerusalem, and placed Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down from thence;

10. for it has been written, That He will give His angels charge concerning thee, in order to guard thee,

11. and they will bear thee upon their hands, lest at any time thou mayest dash thy foot against a stone.

12. And Jesus responding said to him; That it has been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

13. And the devil having perfected every temptation, departed from Him for a season.

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee.And the fame concerning Him went throughout the whole country.

15. And He was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16. And He came into Nazareth, where He was brought up: and according to the custom to Him, He came into the synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and stood up to read.

17. And the Book of Isaiah the prophet was given to Him; and having opened the book, He found the place where it was written,

18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor: hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised,

19. to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.

20. And having closed the book, and giving it back to the officer, He sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.

21. And He began to say to them; This day has this Scripture been fulfilled in your ears.

22. And they all continued to witness to Him, and wonder at the words of grace proceeding out from His mouth: and say, Is not this the son of Joseph?

23. And He said to them, You truly speak to me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: so many things as we heard having been done in Capernaum, do also here in thy own country.

24. And He said, Truly I say unto you, that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.

25. And in truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. When the heaven was shut up three years and six months, how the famine was great over all the land;

26. and Elijah was sent to none of them, except to a widow woman in Sarepta of Sidon.

27. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with wrath.

29. And rising up, they cast Him out of the city, and were leading Him to the brink of the mountain on which their city was built, to hurl Him down;

30. and He having passed through the midst of them went away.

31. And He came down into Capernaum, a city of Galilee,And He was teaching them on the Sabbath.

32. And they were astonished at His teaching; because His word was with authority.

33. And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried with a great voice,

34. saying, Let me alone; what is there to us and to thee, O Jesus the Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

35. Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent and come out from him; and the demon having thrown him down in the midst came out from him, not having injured him.

36. And fear came upon them all, and they were talking together to one another, saying, What word is this? because with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.

37. And the report concerning Him was going out into every place in the surrounding country,

38. Having arisen up from the synagogue, He came into the house of Simon. And the mother-in-law of Simon was afflicted with a great fever; and they asked Him concerning her.

39. And He, standing over her, rebuked the fever; and dismissed it; and immediately, having stood up, she continued to minister unto them.

40. And the sun having gone down, all so many as had people afflicted with various diseases continued to lead them to Him; and He having put His hands on each one of them, healed them.

41. And the demons continued to go out from many, crying, and saying, Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And rebuking them, He did not suffer them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.

42. And it being day, having come out, He departed into a desert place: and the multitudes continued to seek Him; and they came unto Him, and they constrained Him not to depart from them.

43. And He said to them, That, it behooveth me to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to many other cities: because unto this I have been sent.

44. And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. 

## Luke 5

1. And it came to pass, while the multitude is pressing on Him to hear the word of God, and He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;

2. and He saw two ships standing by the lake: the fishermen, having gone from them, were washing their nets.

3. And having come into one of the ships, which belonged to Simon, He asked him to lead out a little from the land, and sitting down He was teaching the multitudes from the ship.

4. When He ceased speaking He said to Simon, Lead out into the deep, and spread your nets for a draught.

5. And Simon responding said to Him, Master, having toiled all night, we caught nothing: but at thy word I will spread the net.

6. And having done this, they caught a great multitude of fishes; and their net was breaking;

7. and they beckoned to their comrades in another ship, having come to assist them, And they came, and filled both ships, so as to sink them.

8. And Simon Peter, seeing, fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying; Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man,

9. For fear took hold of him, and all of those with him, at the draught of fishes which they received.

10. And likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were companions to Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now you shall be catching men.

11. And drawing up their ships to the land, having left all things, they followed Him.

12. And it came to pass, while He was in one of the cities, and behold, there is a man full of leprosy: and seeing Jesus, having fallen on his face, he prayed to Him, saying, Lord, if you may will it, you are able to cleanse me.

13. And reaching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And He commanded him to tell no one: but having gone away, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

15. And the word concerning Him was going abroad: and many multitudes continued to come, and be healed of their diseases by Him.

16. And He was out in the deserts, and praying.

17. And He was in one of the cities, and was teaching; and there were many Pharisees and theologians, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

18. And behold, men carrying a man on a couch, who was paralyzed; and were seeking to bring him in, and place him before Him.

19. And not having found by what way they may bring him in on account of the crowd, going upon the house, they let him down through the tiles along with the bed in their midst in the presence of Jesus.

20. And seeing their faith, He said to him; Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

21. And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, Who is this one who speaketh blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except God only?

22. And having responded He said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?

23. Which is the easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven unto thee; or, to say. Arise and walk about?

24. But in order that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (He said to the paralyzed), I say unto thee, Arise, and having taken thy bed, go into thy house.

25. And immediately having arisen before them, taking the bed on which he was lying down, he went away to his own house, glorifying God.

26. And rapture seized them all, and they continued to glorify God; and they were filled with fear, saying, that, We have seen the paradoxical this day.

27. And after these things He came out, and saw a publican, by name Levi, sitting at the toll, and He said to him, Follow me.

28. And having left all things, rising up, he followed Him.

29. And Levi made a great feast for Him in his own house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and others who were sitting along with Him.

30. And their scribes and the Pharisees were murmuring to His disciples, saying, Wherefore do you eat and drink with publicans and, sinners?

31. And Jesus responding said to them, They that are whole have not need of a physician, but they that are sick;

32. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

33. And they said to Him, Wherefore do the disciples of John fast, and make supplications; likewise also those of the Pharisees; but thy disciples eat and drink?

34. And He said to them, Whether are you able to make the sons of the bridechamber to fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come when the bridegroom must indeed be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.

36. He also spoke a parable to them; Let no one put a piece of new cloth on an old garment; lest the new shall tear it, and the piece from the new will not fit the old.

37. And no one puts new wine into old bottles; lest the new wine shall break the bottles, and it shall be poured out, and the bottles shall perish:

38. but the new wine is to be put into new bottles, and both will be preserved.

39. No one drinking the old immediately wishes the new; for he says, The old is better. 

## Luke 6

1. And it came to pass on the second Sabbath, He was going through the cornfields; and His disciples were plucking the ears, and eating, shelling them out with their hands.

2. And certain ones of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you doing that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?

3. Jesus responded and said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those being with him?

4. How he entered into the house of God, and how he took the shewbread, and ate it, and gave it to those with him; which is not lawful to eat, except the priests only?

5. And He said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath also.

6. And it came to pass on another Sabbath, that He came into the synagogue and taught, and a man was there, whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and Pharisees were watching Him, if He will heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they may find accusation against Him.

8. But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man having the withered hand, Rise up, and stand in the midst; and he having arisen stood.

9. And Jesus said to them, I will ask you; What is lawful on the Sabbath; to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy?

10. And looking around upon them all, He said to him, Reach forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored.

11. And they were filled with rage; and they were talking one to another what they might do to Jesus.

12. And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into the mountain to pray; and was there through the night in the prayer of God.

13. And when it was day, He called His disciples to Him: and having chosen twelve from them, whom He also named apostles;

14. Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John. Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealot;

16. and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became His betrayer.

17. And having come down with them, He stood upon a level place, and a great multitude of His disciples, and a great crowd of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and Tyre and Sidon by the sea, who came to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases;

18. and those troubled by unclean spirits; and they were getting healed.

19. And the whole multitude sought to touch Him: because power was going out from Him, and was healing all.

20. And He lifting up His eyes to His disciples, said, Blessed are ye poor: because the kingdom of God is yours.

21. Blessed are ye who hunger now: because ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye who weep now: because ye shall laugh.

22. Blessed are ye, when the people may hate you, and when they may separate you, and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.

23. Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for behold your reward in heaven is great: for according to these things were their fathers accustomed to do to the prophets.

24. Moreover woe unto you rich! because you exhaust your reward.

25. Woe unto you who are full! because you shall hunger. Woe unto you who are now laughing because you shall weep and mourn.

26. Woe unto you when all the people may speak well of you! because according to the same things their fathers were accustomed to do to the false prophets.

27. But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies with divine love, and do good to those that hate you,

28. bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.

29. To the one smiting thee on the cheek turn the other also; and from the one taking away thy cloak do not withhold even the coat.

30. Give to every one asking thee, and turn not away from the one taking thy possessions,

31. And as you wish that the people may do unto you, do ye unto them even likewise.

32. If you love those who love you, what grace is there to you? for even sinners love those who love them.

33. And if you may do good to those doing good to you, what grace is there to you? for sinners also do the same.

34. And if you may lend to those from whom you may hope to receive, what grace is there to you? for sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive back the equivalent.

35. Moreover love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest: because He is good to the ungrateful and wicked.

36. Therefore be ye merciful, as your Father is indeed merciful.

37. And criticise not, and you can not be criticised. Condemn not, and you can not be condemned.

38. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, heaped up, and shaken down, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For with the same measure, which you measure, it will be measured unto you.

39. And He spoke a parable unto them, Whether is the blind able to lead the blind? will they not both fall into the ditch?

40. The disciple is not above his teacher; but every one having been made perfect shall be as his teacher.

41. But why do you see the mote which is in the eye of your brother, and do not recognize the beam which is in your own eye?

42. Or how are you able to say to your brother; Brother, permit me, I will cast out the mote which is in thine eye, yourself not seeing the beam which is in your own eye? O hypocrite, first cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote which is in the eye of your brother.

43. For there is no beautiful tree producing corrupt fruit, nor corrupt tree producing beautiful fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its own fruit: for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather the grape-bunch from the bramble.

45. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good; and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure of his heart brings forth that which is wicked: for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.

46. But why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

47. Every one coming to me, and hearing my words, and doing the same, I will show you to whom he is like.

48. He is like unto a man building a house, who dug and went down deep, and laid the foundation upon the rock: and there being a flood, the river broke against that house, and it was not able to shake it; for it was founded on the rock.

49. But the one hearing and not doing, is like unto a man building his house upon the ground without a foundation; against which the river broke, and it fell immediately, and great was the fall of that house. 

## Luke 7

1. When He completed all His words in the ears of the people, He came into Capernaum.

2. And the servant of a certain centurion, being sick, was about to die, who was precious to him.

3. And hearing about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, asking Him that having come He may save his servant.

4. And they, having come to Jesus, continued to entreat Him earnestly, saying, That he to whom He will do this is worthy:

5. for he loves our race, and himself built for us a synagogue.

6. And Jesus went along with them. And already He being not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, be not troubled: for I am not worthy that you may come in under my roof:

7. Therefore I did not count myself worthy to come to thee; but speak the word, and my servant shall be healed.

8. For I am also a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

9. And Jesus, having heard these words, was astonished at him, and turning to the multitude following said, I say unto you, I did not find so great faith in Israel.

10. And those having been sent, returning to the house, found the servant well.

11. And it came to pass consecutively, He departed into a city called Nain; and His many disciples and a great multitude went along with Him.

12. And when He drew nigh unto the gate of the city, behold, a dead man, an only born son to his mother, and she a widow, was indeed being carried out: and a great multitude of the city was along with her.

13. And the Lord seeing her, was moved with compassion towards her, and said to her, Weep not.

14. And having come forward He touched the bier: and the pall-bearers stood still: and He said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

15. And the dead man sat up, and began to talk, and Ile gave him to his mother.

16. And fear seized them all: and they continued to glorify God, saying that, A great prophet has arisen among us: and, God has looked upon His people.

17. And that word about Him went out in all Judea, and all the country round about.

18. And His disciples proclaimed to John concerning all these things.

19. And John calling certain two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou the one coming, or must we expect another?

20. And the men having come to Him, said; John the Baptist sent us to thee, saving; Art thou the one coming, or must we expect another?

21. And at that hour He healed many of their diseases and ailments and evil spirits; and He conferred on many blind people the power to see.

22. And Jesus responding said to them, Having gone, proclaim to John those things which you saw and heard; that the blind are seeing, the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, the poor are having the gospel preached unto them;

23. and happy is he whosoever may not be offended in me.

24. And the messengers of John having gone away, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?

25. But what went you out into the wilderness to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold those who are in gaudy apparel and luxury, are in royal palaces.

26. But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, and I say unto you even more than a prophet.

27. This is he concerning whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.

28. I say unto you, among those having been born of women no prophet is greater than John the Baptist; nevertheless the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

29. And all the people hearing and the publicans justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and theologians rejected the counsel of God, against themselves, not having been baptized by him.

31. Then to whom shall I liken the men of this generation, and to whom are they like?

32. They are like unto little children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, We piped unto you, and you did not dance; we mourned unto you, and you did not weep.

33. For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a demon.

34. The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous wine-drinking man, a friend of publicans and sinners.

35. Truly wisdom is justified by her children.

36. And a certain one of the Pharisees, asked Him, that He would eat with him, and having come into the house of the Pharisee, He sat down to the table.

37. Behold, a woman who was a sinner, in the city, also having learned that He is dining in the house of the Pharisee, breaking an alabaster box of myrrh,

38. and standing behind by His feet, weeping, began to moisten His feel with tears, and she wiped them with the hairs of her head, and she continued to copiously kiss His feet, and to anoint them with the myrrh.

39. And the Pharisee, having invited Him, seeing, spoke within himself, saying, If He were a prophet, He would know who and what kind the woman is, who touches Him, because she is a sinner.

40. And Jesus responding said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, Speak, Teacher.

41. There were two debtors to a certain creditor: the one owed him five hundred denaria, and the other fifty.

42. And they not being able to pay, he forgave them both. Then which one of them will love him the more?

43. Simon responding said, I perceive, that he, to whom he forgave the more. And He said to him, You answered correctly.

44. And turning to the woman He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hairs.

45. Thou gavest me no kiss: she, from the time I came in, did not cease copiously kissing my feet.

46. Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she anointed my feet with myrrh.

47. Therefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.

48. And He said to her; Thy sins are forgiven.

49. And those sitting along with Him began to say among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?

50. And He said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved them; go in peace. 

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass consecutively, that He was going through city and village, proclaiming and preaching the gospel of God, and the twelve along with Him.

2. And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,

3. and Joanna the wife of Chuzas the steward of Herod, and Susanna, and many other women, who were accustomed to minister unto Him from those things belonging to them.

4. A great multitude being with Him, and coming to Him throughout every city, He spoke in a parable:

5. A sower went out to sow his seed. And while he was sowing, some fell by the way, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And other fell on the rock; and springing up, withered away, because it had no moisture.

7. And other fell in the midst of thorns, and the thorns growing together, choked it out.

8. And other fell into good ground, and springing up, produced fruit, a hundredfold. Speaking these things, He cried out, Let the one having ears to hear, hear.

9. And His disciples asked Him saying, What might this parable be?

10. And He said; To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

11. And this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.

12. And there are those who hear by the wayside; then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, lest they believing may be saved.

13. And those on the stones are they who, when they may hear, receive the word with joy; and they have no root in them, who believe for a time, and in time of temptation they fall away.

14. And that which falleth among thorns, there are those who hear, and going forward, by the cares and riches and pleasures are choked out, and bring forth no fruit to perfection.

15. And that which is in the good ground, are those whosoever hearing the word in a beautiful and good heart, retain it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

16. But no one having lighted a candle covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but he places it on a candlestick, in order that those coming in may see the light.

17. For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; neither is there any thing concealed, which may not be made known and come into the light.

18. Therefore see how you hear: for whosoever may have, it shall be given unto him; and whosoever may not have, it shall be taken from him, even that which he seems to have.

19. And His mother and His brothers came to Him, and were not able to reach Him on account of the crowd.

20. And it was told Him, Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, wishing to see thee.

21. And He responding said to them, My mother and my brothers are the ones hearing the word of God, and doing it.

22. And it came to pass on one of the days, He and His disciples went into a ship. And He said to them, Let us go to the other side of the lake. And they were embarked.

23. And they sailing, He was asleep: and a storm of wind came down into the lake; and they were being filled, and imperiled.

24. And they having come to Him, awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we perish. And He having arisen, rebuked the wind and the wave of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid were astonished, saying to one another, Who then is this, because He commands the winds and the water, and they obey Him?

26. And they sailed into the country of the Gergesenes, which is over against Galilee.

27. And a certain man from the city, who a long time had demons, and did not wear clothing, and did not remain in the house, but in the tombs; met Him having come to the land.

28. And seeing Jesus, and crying out, he worshiped Him, and said with a loud voice; What is there to me and to thee, O Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I pray thee torment me not.

29. For He commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for since a long time he had possessed him, and he was frequently bound, secured with chains and fetters, and smashing his bonds, was driven by the demons into the desert.

30. And Jesus asked him saying, What is thy name? And he said Legion; because many demons entered into him.

31. And he continued to intreat Him that He should not command them to depart into the abyss.

32. And there was a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain: and they continued to intreat Him that He should permit them to go into them. And He permitted them.

33. And the demons having come out from the man, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and were strangled.

34. And the herders seeing that which took place, fled, and proclaimed it in the city and in the country.

35. And they came out to see that which had happened; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons had gone, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.

36. And those seeing reported to them how the demonized man was saved.

37. And all the multitudes of the surrounding country of the Gergesenes, asked Him to depart from them; because they were seized with great fear. And He having come Into the ship, returned.

38. And the man out of whom the demons had gone prayed to be with Him. And Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. Return to thy own house, and relate, how many things God has done unto thee. And he departed throughout the whole city, preaching how many things Jesus did unto him.

40. And it came to pass when Jesus returned, the multitude received Him; for they were all looking for Him.

41. Behold, a man to whom was the name Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and falling at the feet of Jesus, he continued to intreat Him to come into his house;

42. for there was an only daughter to him, of twelve years, and she was dying. And while He was going the multitudes were thronging Him.

43. And a woman being in an issue of blood twelve years, who having expended all her living with physicians, was not able to be healed by any of them,

44. and having come to Him behind, she touched the hem of His garment: and immediately the issue of blood ceased.

45. And Jesus said, Who is the one having touched me? And all denying, Peter and the disciples with Him said, The multitudes crowd thee and press upon thee, and dost thou say, Who is the one having touched me?

46. And Jesus said, Some one touched me: for I know the power went out from me.

47. And the woman seeing that she was not concealed, came trembling, and falling down before Him, proclaimed on account of what cause she touched Him, in the presence of all the people, and how she was healed immediately.

48. And He said to her, Be of good cheer, daughter; thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

49. And He yet speaking, a certain one comes from the house of the chief ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher:

50. and Jesus hearing, responded to him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be saved.

51. And having come to the house, He did not suffer any to enter except Peter, John, and James, and the father and mother of the child.

52. And they were all weeping, and wailing over her: and He said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.

53. And they hooted at Him, knowing that she was dead.

54. And having put all out, taking her by the hand, He spoke, saying, Child, arise.

55. And her spirit returned, and she stood up immediately. And He commanded that something should be given to her to eat.

56. And her parents were delighted: and He commanded them to tell no one that which had taken place. 

## Luke 9

1. And calling the twelve, He gave to them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.

2. And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

3. And He said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither staff, nor valise, nor bread, nor silver; nor to have two coats.

4. And into whatsoever house you may eaten there abide, and go out from thence.

5. And so many as may not receive you, going out from that city, knock off the dust of your feet for a testimony against them.

6. And going out, they continued to go through the villages, everywhere preaching the gospel, and healing.

7. And Herod the tetrarch heard all things which were wrought by Him; and was at a loss, because it was said by some, that John is risen from the dead;

8. and by some that Elijah has appeared; and by others that one of the old prophets is arisen.

9. And Herod said, I beheaded John: but who is this, concerning whom I hear these things? And he was seeking to see Him.

10. And the apostles having returned, expounded unto Him how many things they did. And taking them He departed privately into a desert place, belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

11. And the multitudes having found out, followed Him And receiving them, He spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those having need of healing.

12. And the day began to decline; and the twelve coming to Him, said, Send away the multitude, in order that having gone into the surrounding villages and countries, they may lodge, and find food: because we are here in a desert place.

13. And He said to them, You give them to eat. And they said, There is not to us more than five loaves and two fishes; if not having gone we must purchase victuals for all this people.

14. For the men were about five thousand. And He said to His disciples, Have them sit down in companies, about fifty.

15. And they did thus, and made all sit down.

16. And taking the five loaves and two fishes, looking up to heaven, He blessed them; and He broke, and gave to the disciples to dispense to the multitude.

17. And they all ate and were filled: and that which remained to them of the fragments, were taken up, twelve baskets.

18. It came to pass, while He was praying alone, His disciples came to Him. And He asked them, saying, Whom do the multitudes say that I am?

19. They responding said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen.

20. And He said to them, But whom do you say that I am? And Peter responding said, The Christ of God.

21. And having charged them, He commanded them to tell it to no one.

22. Saying, That it behooved the Son of man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be killed, and to rise the third day.

23. And He spoke to all, If any one wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

24. For whosoever may wish to save his soul shall lose it; and whosoever may lose his soul for my sake, he shall save it.

25. For what is a man profited, gaining the whole world, and losing or forfeiting himself?

26. For whosoever may be ashamed of me and my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of him, when He may come in His glory, and that of the Father, and that of the holy angels.

27. And truly I say unto you, There are some of those standing here, who may not taste of death, until they may see the kingdom of God.

28. And it came to pass after these discourses, about eight days, and taking Peter and John and James, He went up into the mountain to pray.

29. And it came to pass while He was praying, the appearance of His countenance was changed, and His raiment shining white.

30. And behold two men were talking with Him, who were Moses and Elijah:

31. who being seen in glory, was speaking of His departure which He was about to perfect in Jerusalem.

32. And Peter and those who were along with Him, were burdened with sleep. And having watched through the night, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with him.

33. It came to pass when they departed from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he says.

34. And he speaking these things there was a cloud, and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid while they were entering into the cloud.

35. And there was a voice from the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear ye Him. And while the voice is heard, Jesus is found alone.

36. And they were silent, and they told no one during those days any of those things which they had seen

37. And it came to pass, on the following day, they having come down from the mountain, a multitude met Him.

38. And behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I pray thee look upon my son, because he is to me an only child:

39. and behold, the spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; and he convulses him with foam, and scarcely departs from him, contorting him.

40. And I besought thy disciples, that they should cast him out; and they were not able.

41. And Jesus responding said, O ye faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring your son hither.

42. And he yet coming, the demon dashed him down and convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child, and gave him to his father.

43. And all were astonished at the majesty of God.And all being astonished at all things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,

44. You place these words in your ears: for the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.

45. And they did not understand this word, and it was hidden from them, in order that they should not understand it: and they were afraid to ask Him concerning this word.

46. And a dispute came in among them, as to which one of them might be the greater.

47. And Jesus seeing the dispute of their heart, taking a little child, He placed it by Himself,

48. and said to them, Whosoever may receive this little child in my name receives me; and whosoever may receive me receives him that sent me. For he who is least among you all, the same shall be great.

49. And John responding said, Master, we saw one casting out the demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.

50. And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for whosoever is not against us is on our side.

51. And it came to pass while the days of His taking up were being fulfilled, and He turned His face to go to Jerusalem,

52. and He sent messengers before His face. And they going forward, entered into a city of the Samaritans, in order to prepare for Him;

53. and they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.

54. And the disciples James and John, seeing, said, Lord, do you wish that we may command fire to descend from heaven and consume them?

55. And He turning, rebuked them.

56. And they went into another village.

57. And they going on the way, a certain one said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee wheresoever thou mayest go.

58. And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven nests; but the Son of man has not a place where He may recline His head.

59. And He said to another, Follow thou me. And he said, Lord, permit me first having gone away to bury my father.

60. And Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead; but thou having gone away proclaim the kingdom of God.

61. And another said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee; but first permit me to bid adieu to those at my own home.

62. And Jesus said to him, No one putting his hand to the plow, and looking back, is worthy of the kingdom of God. 

## Luke 10

1. After these things the Lord chose seventy others also, and sent them out two by two before His face, into every place and city, where He was about to come.

2. And He said to them, The harvest is indeed great, but the laborers are few: therefore pray you the Lord of the harvest, that He may send forth laborers into His harvest.

3. Go: behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Take neither purse, nor valise, nor sandals: salute no one by the way.

5. Into whatsoever house you may enter, first say, Peace be unto this house.

6. And if the son of peace may be there, your peace shall rest upon it: but if not, it shall return unto you.

7. Abide in the same house, eating and drinking those things which are with them: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.

8. Into whatsoever city you may enter and they may receive you, eat those things which are placed by you:

9. and heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.

10. And into whatsoever city you may enter, and they may not receive you, having come out into the streets of the same, say,

11. Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, do we wipe off against you: but know this, that the kingdom of God is at hand.

12. For I say unto you, that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.

13. Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which were wrought in you had been in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting down in sackcloth and ashes.

14. Moreover it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, art thou not exalted up to heaven? thou shalt be cast down to Hades.

16. He that heareth you heareth me; he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth Him that sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subordinated to us in thy name.

18. And He said to them, I saw Satan having fallen as the lightning from heaven.

19. Behold I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.

20. Moreover do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens.

21. At the same hour He rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I praise thee, O Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes: yea, Father, because it was thus pleasing in thy sight.

22. And turning to His disciples, He said, All things have been delivered to me by my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, except the Father; and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whom He may wish to reveal Him.

23. And turning to His disciples, privately He said, Happy are your eyes, seeing those things which you see.

24. For I say unto you, that many kings and prophets desired to see those things which you see, and saw them not; and to hear those things which you hear, and heard them not.

25. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up tempting Him, saying, Teacher, having done what shall I inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him, What has been written in the law? how do you read it?

27. And he responding said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with divine love from all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.

28. And He said to him, You answered correctly: do this, and you shall live.

29. But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30. Jesus responding said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and fell among thieves, who indeed having stripped him of his raiment, administered blows, went away, leaving him half dead.

31. And by chance a certain priest came down that way: and seeing him, passed by on the other side.

32. And likewise also a Levite, being at the place, coming and seeing, passed by on the other side.

33. And a certain Samaritan, on a journey, came near him: and seeing, had compassion on him,

34. and having come to him, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and having mounted him on his own beast, carried him to a tavern, and cared for him.

35. And on the morrow, taking out two denaria, gave them to the host, and said, Care for him; and whatsoever you expend in addition, on my return, I will pay you.

36. Which one of these three seems to you to have been the neighbor of him who fell among the thieves?

37. And he said, The one having done mercy with him. And Jesus said to him, Go, thou, and do likewise.

38. And it came to pass while they were going round, He also came into a certain village: and a certain woman by name Martha received Him into her house.

39. And there was a sister to her called Mary, who indeed sitting down at the feet of the Lord, continued to hear his word:

40. and Martha was very busy about much serving. And standing over Him, she said, Lord, is there no care to thee that my sister has left me to serve alone? then say to her that she must assist me.

41. And the Lord responding said to her, Martha, Martha, you are solicitous and encumbered concerning many things:

42. but there is need of one thing: for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her. 

## Luke 11

1. And it came to pass, that He was in a certain place praying; when He ceased, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. And He said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father, let thy name be hallowed: let thy kingdom come:

3. give unto us this day our daily bread:

4. and forgive us our sins; for we also do forgive every one owing us: and lead us not into temptation.

5. And He said to them, Which one of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

6. since my friend came to me from the road, and I have nothing which I may place before him.

7. And he responding from within, said, Do not give me trouble: the door has already been closed, and my children are in bed with me; I am not able rising to give unto thee.

8. I say unto you, If indeed having risen he will not give unto him, because he is his friend, yet on account of his shamelessness, rising he will give him as much as he needs.

9. And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

10. For every one asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened.

11. And which father of you shall if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? or indeed a fish, will he instead of a fish give him a serpent?

12. Or indeed shall he ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. If then you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, then how much more will your Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?

14. And He was casting out a demon, and he was dumb: and it came to pass, the demon having gone out, the dumb spoke; and the multitudes were astonished.

15. And certain ones of them said, He casts out the demon through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.

16. And others tempting, continued to seek with Him a sign from heaven.

17. And He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself, comes to desolation, and house falls upon house.

18. And if Satan were indeed divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I am casting out demons through Beelzebul.

19. But if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges:

20. but if I through the finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.

21. When the strong man armed may keep his palace, his goods are in peace:

22. but when one stronger than he, having come, may conquer him, he takes away his panoply in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.

23. The one not being with me is against me; and the one not gathering with me scatters abroad.

24. When the unclean spirit may go out from the man, he goes through dry places; seeking rest, and finding none, he says, I will return into my own house, whence I came out.

25. And having come he finds it swept and beautified.

26. Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having come in he dwells there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

27. And it came to pass, while He is speaking these words, a certain woman lifting up her voice from the crowd, said to Him, Blessed is the womb having borne thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.

28. And He said, Truly blessed are those hearing the word of God, and keeping it.

29. And the multitudes being assembled, He began to say, This is a wicked generation: it seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man also be a sign to this generation.

31. The queen of the south will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn them; because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold a greater than Jonah is here.

33. No one, having lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, nor under a bushel, but on a candlestick, in order that those coming in may see the light.

34. The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye may be clear, truly thy whole body is lighted; but when it may be had, truly thy body is dark.

35. See then that the light which is in thee is not darkness.

36. If then thy whole body is lighted, having no part dark, all will be lighted, as when a lamp may light thee with its brightness.

37. And while He was speaking, a Pharisee asked Him, that He would dine with him: and having come in, He sat up at the table.

38. And the Pharisee seeing, was astonished because He was not first baptized before dinner.

39. And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees purify the outside of the cup and the plate, but the interior is full of extortion and wickedness.

40. Ye fools, did not the One having made the outside also make the inside?

41. Therefore give alms of your substance; and behold all things are pure unto you.

42. But woe unto you, Pharisees! because you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and you pass by judgment and the love of God: it behooveth to do these things, and not to omit those.

43. Woe unto you, Pharisees! because you love the front seat in the synagogues, and salutations in the forums.

44. Woe unto you! because you are like tombs unseen, and men walking over them do not know it.

45. And a certain one of the theologians responding says to Him, Teacher, speaking these things yon indeed insult us.

46. And He said, Woe unto you, theologians! because you lay burdens on the people difficult to be borne, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe unto you! because you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Therefore you are witnesses and you consent unto the works of your fathers: because they slew them, and you build.

49. Therefore the wisdom of God said, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will slay and persecute.

50. In order that the blood of all the prophets poured out from the foundation of the world, may be required from this generation;

51. from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the house; yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.

52. Woe unto you, theologians! because you have taken away the key of knowledge: you did not come in, and you prohibited those who were coming in.

53. And He having come out from thence, the scribes and Pharisees began vehemently to press on Him, and mouth after Him concerning many things;

54. laying in wait, to catch something from His mouth. 

## Luke 12

1. In the meantime, myriads of the multitude having gathered together, So that they trode on one another, He began to speak to His disciples first; Take heed unto yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. But there is nothing hidden, which shall not be revealed: and concealed, that shall not be made known.

3. Therefore so many things as you spoke in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and whatsoever you spoke in the ear in the secret chambers shall be proclaimed upon the houses.

4. And I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these things, having nothing more to do.

5. But I will show you whom you must fear: Fear him, who after he kills has power to cast into hell. Yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? and one of them is not forgotten before God.

7. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are more important than many sparrows.

8. But I say unto you, that every one who may confess me before the people, the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.

9. But the one denying me before the people will be denied before the angels of God.

10. And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him having blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.

11. But when they may carry you into the synagogues, and tribunals, and authorities; do not be solicitous as to what you may apologize, or what you may say:

12. for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour the things which it behooveth you to speak.

13. And a certain one from the multitude said to Him, Teacher, speak to my brother, to divide the inheritance with me.

14. And He said to him; Man, who established me judge or a divider over you?

15. And He said to them, See, and beware of all covetousness: because his life is not in that which aboundeth to any one, from those things belonging to him.

16. He spake a parable to them, saying, The farm of a certain rich man was very productive:

17. and he was reasoning in himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no place where I shall store my fruits?

18. And he said, I will do this: I will take down my barns, and build greater, and there I will gather all my fruits and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.

20. But God said to him, Thou fool, this night they are demanding thy soul from thee; and to whom shall those things which thou hast prepared, belong?

21. So is every one laying up treasure for himself, and not rich toward God.

22. And He spoke to His disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not solicitous for your soul, what you may eat; nor for your body, what you may put on.

23. The soul is more than food, and the body more than raiment.

24. Observe the ravens, because they neither sow nor reap; to which there is no storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them; are you not much better than the fowls?

25. And which one of you being solicitous is able to add one moment to his existence?

26. If then you are powerless in the smallest matter, why are you solicitous about other things?

27. Observe the lilies, how they toil not, neither do they spin: and I say unto you, That Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these.

28. And if God so clothes the verdure flourishing in the fields to-day, and to-morrow cast into the oven; how much more are you, O ye of little faith?

29. And do not seek what you may eat, and what you may drink, and with what you are clothed;

30. for the heathens of the world are seeking after all these things: but your Father knows that you have need of these things.

31. Moreover seek His kingdom and these things shall be added unto you.

32. Fear not, little flock; because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell your possessions and give alms; make for yourselves purses that will not get old, and treasure in the heavens which can not be stolen, where the thief does not draw nigh, nor the moth corrupt.

34. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be.

35. Let your loins be girted, and your lamps burning;

36. and be you like unto men waiting for their lord, when he may rise up from the marriage feast; in order that, coming and knocking, they may open unto him immediately.

37. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord having come will find watching: truly I say unto you, that he will gird himself, and have them sit down, and having come will serve them.

38. If at the second, and third, watch he may come, happy are ye.

39. Know this, that if the landlord knew at what hour the thief cometh, he would not have permitted his house to be broken into.

40. Be ye also ready: because at an hour you do not think the Son of man cometh.

41. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or to all?

42. The Lord said, Who then is the faithful, wise steward, whom the lord will establish over his house-hold, to give them their food in season?

43. Happy is that servant, whom his lord having come shall thus find watching.

44. Truly I say unto you, that he will establish him over all his possessions.

45. But if that servant may say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming, and may begin to smite the servants and handmaidens, and to eat and drink, and be drunken;

46. the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he does not expect, and in an hour in which he does not know, and will cut him off, and will appoint his part with the unbelievers.

47. But that servant knowing the will of his lord, and not preparing or doing according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

48. But the one not knowing, and doing things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. But to every one to whom much is given, much will be required of him: and to whom they commit much, of him they will ask the more.

49. I have come to send fire on the earth; and what do I will, if it is already kindled?

50. And I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it may be perfected!

51. Do you think that I have come to give peace on the earth? I say unto you, Nay, but division.

52. For from now, there shall be five in one house divided, three shall be divided against two, and two against three:

53. the father against the son, and the son against the father; and the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.

54. And he also spoke to the multitudes, When you may see a cloud rising from the west, you immediately say, that the rain cometh; and it is so:

55. and when the south wind is blowing, you say, that it will be hot; and it is so.

56. You hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the earth and the firmament; and how do you not discern this time?

57. Why do you not judge righteous judgment, even with reference to yourselves?

58. For as you go with your adversary to the ruler, give attention on the way that you be reconciled with him; lest he may deliver you to the judge, and the judge shall turn you over to the officer, and the officer will cast you into prison.

59. I say unto you, You can by no means come out thence, till you have even paid the last mite. 

## Luke 13

1. And there were certain ones at that time announcing to him concerning the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices.

2. And responding to them He said, Do you think that those Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered these things?

3. T say unto you, Nay: but unless you may repent, you shall all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Saloam fell, and killed them, do you think that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?

5. I say unto you, Nay: but unless you may repent, you will all likewise perish.

6. And He spoke this parable, A certain one had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and came seeking fruit on it and found none;

7. and he said to the vinedresser, Behold, three years from which I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and I find none: cut it down; why indeed does it cumber the ground?

8. And responding he says to him, Lord, let it alone also this year, until I shall dig about it, and cast manures:

9. and if it may bear fruit in the future; and if not you shall cut it down.

10. And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

11. And behold, a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and not at all able to straighten up.

12. And Jesus seeing her, called to her, and said, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity:

13. and He placed His hands on her: and immediately she straightened up, and continued to glorify God.

14. And the chief ruler of the synagogue, responding, being grieved because Jesus healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which it behooveth us to work: therefore during these, coming, be healed, and not on the Sabbath-day.

15. And the Lord responded to him, and said, Ye hypocrites, does not each one of you loose his ox or his donkey from the stall, and leading him away, give him water on the Sabbath?

16. Did it not behoove this one, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bondage on the Sabbath-day?

17. And He speaking these things, all opposing Him became ashamed: and the whole multitude rejoiced over all the illustrious works wrought by Him.

18. Then He said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man having taken, cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches.

20. And again He said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.

22. And He was journeying through cities and villages, teaching, and making His journey towards Jerusalem.

23. And one said to Him, Lord, are the saved few? And He said to them,

24. Agonize to enter in through the narrow gate: because many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.

25. When the landlord may rise up, and close the door, and you may begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying, Lord, open unto us; and responding he will say unto you, I know not whence you are.

26. Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou didst preach in our streets.

27. And he will say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.

28. And there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you cast out.

29. And they will come from the east and west, and the north and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.

30. And behold, the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.

31. At that hour certain Pharisees came to Him, saying; Depart, and go hence: because Herod wishes to slay thee.

32. And He said to them, Having gone, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perfect healings to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I am made perfect.

33. Moreover it behooves Me to travel to-day and to-morrow and the day following: because it does not behoove a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that have been sent unto thee! how frequently did I wish to gather thy children, in the manner in which a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye were not willing!

35. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. I say unto you, that you can see me no more, until it shall come to pass that you may say, Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord. 

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass when He entered into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching Him.

2. And, behold, a certain dropsical man was before Him.

3. And Jesus responding spoke to the theologians and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day, or not? and they were silent.

4. And taking him by the hand, He healed him, and sent him away.

5. And responding to them He said; Of which one of you shall his son or his ox fall into a pit, and will he not immediately lift him out on the Sabbath-day?

6. and they were not able to respond to these things.

7. And He spoke a parable to those whom He had called, warning them that they should not choose the first couches; saying to them,

8. When you may be called by any one to a marriage feast, do not sit down upon the first couch; lest one more worthy than thee may have been called by him,

9. and the one having called thee and him, having come in shall say to thee, Give place to him; and then thou shalt with shame begin to take the last place.

10. But when you may be invited, coming in sit down in the last place; in order that when the one having invited thee may come, he will say to thee, Friend, come up higher: then there will be glory to thee in the presence of all those sitting along with thee.

11. Because every one who shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

12. And He spoke to the one having also invited Him, When you may make a dinner or a supper, do not call your rich friends, nor your brothers, nor your kindred, nor your neighbors; lest they may also invite thee in turn, and there may be a recompense unto thee.

13. But when you may make a feast, invite the poor, maimed, lame, blind:

14. and thou shalt be happy; because they have nothing with which to recompense thee: and it shall be recompensed unto thee in the resurrection of the just.

15. And a certain one of those sitting together, hearing these things, said to Him, Happy is he whosoever eateth bread in the kingdom of God.

16. And He said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many;

17. and at the hour, of the supper he sent his servants to say to those who were invited, Come; because they are now ready.

18. And they all of one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a farm, and I have need having gone to see it: I pray thee have me excused.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove the same: I intreat thee have me excused.

20. Another said, I have married a wife, and on this account I am not able to come.

21. And the servant coming, announced these things to his lord. Then the land-lord being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and lead in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.

22. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou didst command, and yet there is room.

23. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, in order that my house may be filled:

24. for I say unto you, that no one of these men who have been invited shall taste of my supper.

25. And many multitudes were journeying along with Him, and turning He said to them,

26. If any one comes to me, and does not hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and even yet his own soul, he is not able to be my disciple.

27. Whosoever does not carry his cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.

28. For which one of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sitting down count the cost; if he has unto sufficiency?

29. Lest he having laid the foundation, and being unable to complete it, all who see it may begin to mock him,

30. saying, that this man began to build, and was not able to complete it.

31. Or what king, going forth to engage in war with another king, will not first sitting down counsel if he is able with ten thousand to meet him who is coming against him, with twenty thousand?

32. But if not, while he is yet a great way off, sending an embassy, he asks for those things which appertain to peace.

33. Thus then every one of you who does not consecrate all his possessions, is not able to be my disciple.

34. Therefore salt is good: but if the salt may lose its savor, with what shall it be salted?

35. It is neither good for the land nor for excrement: they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 

## Luke 15

1. And all the publicans and sinners were drawing nigh to Him to hear Him.

2. And the Pharisees and scribes were murmuring, saying, that, He receives sinners, and eats with them.

3. And He spoke this parable to them, saying,

4. What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the desert, and go after the lost one, until he may find it?

5. And having found it, places it on his shoulders, rejoicing:

6. and having come into the house, calls together the friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep which was lost.

7. I say unto you that so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, rather than ninety and nine just persons who have not need of repentance.

8. Or what woman having ten drachmae, if she may lose one drachma, does she not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she may find it?

9. And having found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, because I have found the drachma which I lost.

10. So, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

11. And He said, A certain man had two sons.

12. And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give to me the portion of the estate that falls to me. And he immediately divided unto them his living.

13. And not many days afterward the younger son gathering all together, departed into a far-off country; and there wasted his substance living riotously.

14. And he having expended all, a severe famine came into that country; and he began to be in want.

15. And having gone he joined himself to one of the citizens of that country: and he sent him into his fields to feed swine:

16. and he was desiring to fill his stomach from the pods, which the swine were eating: and no one gave unto him:

17. and having come to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread in abundance, but here I perish with hunger!

18. Having risen I will go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:

19. and I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.

20. And having risen, he came to his father. And he being yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and having run, fell upon his neck, and kissed him copiously.

21. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: and I am no more worthy to be called thy son.

22. And the father said to his servants, Bring hither the first robe, and put it on him; and give a ring to his hand, and sandals to his feet:

23. and bring hither the fatted calf, slay him, and eating, let us be merry:

24. because this my son was dead, and is alive again; was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

25. And his elder son was in the field: and while coming he drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And calling one of the servants, asked him what these things might be.

27. And he said to him, Because thy brother has come; and thy father has slain the fatted calf, because he received him sound.

28. And he was angry, and did not wish to come in: and his father having gone out, continued to intreat him. And responding he said to the father,

29. Behold, I serve thee so many years, and have never transgressed thy commandment: and thou hast never given me a kid, that I may rejoice with my friends:

30. but when this thy son, the one devouring thy living with harlots came, thou hast slain for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all mine are thine:

32. and it behooved me to be glad and rejoice; because this thy brother was dead, and is alive; was lost, and is found. 

## Luke 16

1. And He also spoke to His disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he was slandered to him as wasting his goods.

2. And having called him, he said to him, What is this which I hear concerning thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou art not able to be steward any longer.

3. And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my lord takes away my stewardship from me? I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what I shall do, in order that when I am deposed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

5. And calling each one of the debtors of his lord, he said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?

6. And he said; A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your accounts, and sitting down quickly write fifty.

7. Then he said to another one, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your account, and write fourscore.

8. And the lord praised the steward of unrighteousness because he acted shrewdly: because the sons of this age are wiser in their generation than the sons of the light.

9. And I say unto you, Make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, in order that, when it may fail, they may receive you into eternal tabernacles.

10. He that is faithful in the least is also faithful in much: and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous in much.

11. If therefore you were not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust to you the true?

12. If you were not faithful in the interest of another, who will give you your own?

13. No servant is able to serve two masters: for he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon.

14. And the Pharisees, being avaricious, were hearing all these things, and murmuring against Him.

15. And He said to them, Ye are those who justify yourselves before the people; but God knows your hearts: because that which is exalted among the people is abomination in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one presses into it.

17. And it is easier that heaven and earth pass away, than one tittle fall from the law.

18. Every one sending away his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery; and the one marrying her who has been sent away by her husband commits adultery.

19. There was a certain rich man, and he was habitually clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day.

20. But a certain beggar, Lazarus by name, was laid at his gate, full of sores,

21. and desiring to be fed by the crumbs falling from the table of the rich man; but the dogs also coming continued to lick his sores.

22. And it came to pass that the beggar died, and himself was carried by the angels into the bosom of Abraham: and the rich man also died, and was buried.

23. And in Hades lifted up his eyes, being in torment, sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And he calling said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, because I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Child, remember that you received your good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.

26. And in addition to all these things, there is a great gulf fixed between us and you, in order that those wishing to go hence to you may not be able, neither can they come thence to us.

27. And he said, Moreover I intreat you, father, that you may send him to the house of my father:

28. for I have five brothers; in order that he may testify to them, that they may not also come to this place of the torment.

29. But Abraham says, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

30. But he said, No, father Abraham: but if one may go to them from the dead, they will repent.

31. But he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded if one may rise from the dead. 

## Luke 17

1. And He spoke to His disciples, It is impossible for offenses not to come: but woe unto him, through whom they come;

2. it is good for him if a millstone is hung around his neck, and he is cast into the sea, rather than that he may offend one of these little ones.

3. Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother may sin, rebuke him; if he may repent, forgive him.

4. But if he may sin against thee seven times a day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.

6. And the Lord said, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed. you should say to this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up, and planted in the sea; and it would obey you.

7. But which one of you, having a servant plowing or serving a shepherd, who will say to him, having come in from the field, Coming hither sit down immediately?

8. But will he not say to him, Prepare what I may sup, and girding thyself, minister unto me, until I may eat and drink; and after these things you eat and drink?

9. Whether does he thank the servant because he did the things which were commanded?

10. Likewise also, when you may do those things which are commanded you, say that, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.

11. And it came to pass, while He was journeying to Jerusalem, and He was going through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. He coming into a certain village, ten lepers met Him, who stood afar off;

13. and lifting up their voice, saying, Thou, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

14. And seeing, He said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priest. And it came to pass while they were going, they were cleansed:

15. and one of them, seeing that he was healed, returned, with a loud voice glorifying God,

16. and he fell upon his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him: and he was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus responding said, Were not the ten cleansed?

18. Where are the nine? And they were not found returning to give thanks to God, except this one foreigner.

19. And He said to him, having arisen, go: thy faith hath saved thee.

20. Then being interrogated by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God is coming, He responded to them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:

21. neither will they say; Lo, here! or, there! for behold, the kingdom of God is among you.

22. And He said to the disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and will not see it.

23. And they will say to you, Lo, here! lo, there! go not away, nor follow them.

24. For as the lightning, flashing out of the one part under the heaven, gleams into the other part under heaven, so shall be the Son of man in His day.

25. But it behooves Him first to suffer many things and to be set at nought by this generation.

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of man.

27. They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were getting married, until the day on which Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;

29. and on the day on which Lot went out from Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from heaven and destroyed them all.

30. According to these things it will be in the day the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day, let not him who is on the house, and his goods in the house, come down to take them: and likewise let not him who is in the field turn back.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whosoever may seek to save his soul shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it shall find it.

34. I say unto you, on that night two men shall be on one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left.

35. Two women shall be grinding at the same mill; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

36. Responding they say to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Where the body is, there the eagles will also be gathered together. 

## Luke 18

1. And He spoke a parable to them that it behooves them to pray always, and not to faint;

2. saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city, fearing not God, and regarding not man.

3. And there was a widow in that city; and she continued to come to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

4. And he was not willing for a time: but after these things he said in himself, Though I fear not God nor regard man,

5. yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, lest coming forever she may smite me in the face.

6. But the Lord said, I fear what the unjust judge says.

7. And shall not God avenge His elect, crying to Him day and night, and He is long-suffering over them?

8. I say unto you, that He will avenge them speedily. Moreover the Son of man having come, will He then find faith upon the earth?

9. And He spoke this parable to certain ones having confidence in themselves that they are righteous, and despising the rest.

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

11. The Pharisee standing was praying in these words, God, I thank thee because I am not like the rest of the men, extortioners, unjust, adulterous, or even as this publican:

12. I fast twice per week; I give tithes of all things so many as I possess.

13. But the publican, standing a great way off, did not wish even to lift up his eyes to the heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me the sinner.

14. I say unto you, He went down to his house justified rather than the other: because every one exalting himself shall be abased; and the one humbling himself shall be exalted.

15. And they were indeed bringing the infants to Him, that He should touch them: but the disciples seeing rebuked them.

16. And Jesus calling them to Him, said, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Truly I say unto you, whosoever may not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, can not enter into it.

18. And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good, except One, God.

20. You know the commandments, thou must not commit adultery, thou must not murder, thou must not steal, thou must not bear false witness, honor thy father and mother.

21. And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.

22. And Jesus hearing these things, said to him, Still one thing is lacking to thee: Sell all things whatsoever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

23. And hearing these things, he went away very sorrowful; for he was exceedingly rich.

24. Jesus seeing him said, How hardly will those having riches enter into the kingdom of God!

25. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of God.

26. And those hearing said, And who is able to be saved?

27. And He said, Those things which are impossible with men are possible with God.

28. And Peter said, Behold, we have left all things, and followed thee.

29. And He said to them, Truly I say unto you, that there is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who may not receive a hundredfold in this time, and in the coming age eternal life.

31. And taking the twelve aside, He said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things which have been written by the prophets shall be perfected to the Son of man.

32. For He will be delivered to the Gentiles; and be mocked, and insulted, and spat upon:

33. and having scourged Him, they will kill Him; and He will arise the third day.

34. And they understood none of these things; and this word was hidden from them, and they did not know the things spoken.

35. And it came to pass, while He was drawing nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the wayside begging.

36. And hearing the multitude passing by, he inquired what it might be.

37. And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene is going along.

38. And he cried out saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

39. And the passersby continued to rebuke him, that he should keep silent: but he continued to cry out much more, O thou son of David, have mercy on me.

40. And Jesus standing, commanded him to be led to Him; and he drawing nigh, He asked him,

41. What do you wish that I shall do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may look up.

42. And Jesus said to him, Look up: thy faith hath saved thee.

43. And immediately he looked up, and followed Him, glorifying God: and all the people, seeing, gave praise to God. 

## Luke 19

1. And having come in He passed through Jericho.

2. And behold, a certain man by name called Zaccheus; and he was chief of the publicans, and he was rich.

3. And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He is; and was not able on account of the multitude, because he was small in stature.

4. And having run forward in advance, he went up in a sycamore-tree in order that he might see Him: because He was about to pass that way.

5. And when He came to the place, Jesus looking up, saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, hastening, come down; for it behooveth me to abide in thy house this day.

6. And hastening, he came down, and received Him rejoicing.

7. And all seeing, murmured, saying, that He is come in to abide with a sinner man.

8. And Zaccheus standing, said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any one fraudulently, I restore fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;

10. for the Son of man came to seek and to save that which is lost.

11. And they hearing these things, proceeding, He spoke a parable, because he is nigh unto Jerusalem, and they think the kingdom of God is about to be made manifest immediately.

12. Then He said, A certain nobleman went to a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and return.

13. And calling his ten servants, he gave to them ten pounds, and said to them, Operate till I come.

14. But his citizens continued to hate him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We do not wish this man to rule over us.

15. And it came to pass, when he returned, having received the kingdom, and he said, that those servants should be called, to whom he had given the money, in order that he might know what each one had gained by their merchandise.

16. And the first came, saying, Lord, thy pound has gained ten pounds.

17. And he said to him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in the least, have thou authority over ten cities.

18. And the second one came, saying, Lord, thy pound has gained five pounds.

19. And he also said to him, Be thou over five cities.

20. And the other one came, saying, Lord, behold, thy pound, which I had laid away in a napkin:

21. for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou hadst not laid down, and thou reapest that which thou hast not sown.

22. And he says to him, Out of thine own mouth I will judge thee, thou wicked servant. Didst thou know that I am an austere man, taking up what I have not laid down, and reaping what I have not sown?

23. Wherefore indeed didst thou not put my money in the bank? and having come I would have received the same with the product.

24. And he said to the bystanders, Take the pound from him, and give it to the one having ten pounds.

25. And they said to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.

26. I say unto you, that to every one having it shall be given; and from every one not having, it shall be taken away even that which he hath.

27. Moreover bring these my enemies, not wishing me to rule over them, hither, and slay them before me.

28. And speaking these things, He was journeying before them, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass, when He drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the Mount of Olives, and He sent away two of His disciples,

30. saying, Go into the village over against you; in which entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men ever sat: loosing, lead him hither.

31. And if any one may ask you, Why do you loose him? thus say to him, that the Lord hath need of him:

32. and those having been sent, departing, found as Jesus told them.

33. And they loosing the donkey, his master said to them, Why do you loose the donkey?

34. And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

35. And they led him to Jesus: and casting their garments on the colt, they mounted Jesus on them.

36. And He going forward, they were strewing their garments in the road.

37. And He already drawing nigh to the descension of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God with a loud voice for all those miracles which they saw; shouting,

38. saying, Blessed is the King coming in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

39. And certain ones of the Pharisees from the multitude said to Him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples:

40. and He responding said to them, I say unto you, that if these may keep silent, the rocks will cry out.

41. And when He drew near, seeing the city He wept over it,

42. saying, If thou indeed hadst known, truly in this thy day, the things appertaining to thy peace! but now they are hidden from thy eyes.

43. Because the days will come upon thee, and thine enemies will cast a fortification about thee, and surround thee, and press in on thee from all directions,

44. and will slay thee, and thy children in thee; and will leave in thee not a stone upon a stone; because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.

45. And having come into the temple, He began to cast out those buying and selling,

46. saying to them; It has been written, My house shall be a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves.

47. And He was teaching daily in the temple, and the chief priests and scribes and the first men of the people were seeking to destroy Him.

48. And they were not finding what they might do; for all the people hung on Him, hearing Him. 

## Luke 20

1. And it came to pass, on one of those days, He teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the priests, and scribes, along with the elders stood up against Him;

2. and they spoke to Him, saying, Tell us by what authority you are doing these things? Who is the one having given you this authority?

3. And responding He said to them, I will ask you one word; and you tell me:

4. Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men?

5. And they reason among themselves saying, If we may say it is from heaven; He will say, Why did you not believe on him?

6. And if we may say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

7. And they responded, We do not know whence it is.

8. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

9. And He began to speak to the people this parable, A man planted a vineyard and gave it out to husbandmen, and went away a long time.

10. And in season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard, and the husbandmen beating him, sent him away empty.

11. And he proceeded to send to them another servant, and they beating and dishonoring him sent him away empty.

12. And he proceeded to send a third: and wounding him, they cast him out also.

13. And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my own beloved son: perchance seeing, they will reverence him.

14. And the husbandmen, seeing him, reasoned among themselves saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, in order that the inheritance may be ours.

15. And casting him out from the vineyard they slew him; what then will the lord of the vineyard do?

16. He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And hearing, they said, Let it not be so.

17. And looking upon them, He said, What is that which has been written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same has come to be the head of the corner.

18. Every one having fallen on that stone will be dashed to pieces; and on whomsoever it may fall, it will grind him to powder.

19. And the chief priests and scribes sought to lay hands on Him at this hour, and feared the people; for they knew that He spoke this parable against them.

20. And laying in wait for Him, they sent sharpers, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might catch his word, in order to turn Him over to the government and authority of the proconsul.

21. They asked Him saying, Teacher, we know that thou dost speak and teach correctly; and thou dost not receive the face; but thou dost teach the way of God in truth:

22. is it lawful for us give tribute to Caesar, or not?

23. And He knowing their rascality, said to them, Why tempt ye me?

24. Show me the denarion. Whose image and superscription has it? And they responding said, Caesar's.

25. And He said to them, Therefore render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.

26. And they were not able to criticise His word before the people: and being astonished at His answer, they were silent.

27. And certain ones of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, coming forward asked Him,

28. saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if the brother of any one may die having a wife, and the same may die childless, that his brother must take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.

29. Then there were seven brothers; and the first receiving a wife died childless.

30. And the second

31. and the third received her, and likewise also the seven; they left no children and died.

32. Last of all the woman also died.

33. Therefore in the resurrection of which one of them is she the wife? for the seven had her a wife.

34. And responding Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,

35. but those counted worthy to attain that age and the resurrection, which is from the dead,

36. neither marry nor are given in marriage; for they are not able yet to die; for they are like the angels, and sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

37. But that the dead are raised, Moses also mentioned at the Bush, when he says; The Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live unto Him.

39. And certain of the scribes responding said; Teacher, you spoke beautifully.

40. And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.

41. And He said to them; How do they say that the Christ is the son of David?

42. And David himself says in the Book of the Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

43. until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.

44. Therefore David calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?

45. And all the people hearing, He said to His disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and loving salutations in the forums, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers,

47. Who devour the houses of the widows, and pray long through pretext; they shall receive the greater judgment. 

## Luke 21

1. And looking up, He saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And He also saw a certain poor widow, casting in thither two mites.

3. And He said; Truly I say unto you, That this poor widow cast in more than all.

4. For they all of that which abounds unto them cast into the gifts of God: but she out of her scarcity cast in all her living which she had.

5. And certain ones speaking concerning the temple, that it was ornamented with beautiful stones and offerings, He said,

6. These things which you see, the days will come, in which stone will not be left upon stone, which shall not be thrown down.

7. And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, when then shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when these things may be about to come to pass?

8. And He said, See that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am He; and The time is at hand: go ye not after them.

9. And when ye may hear of wars and commotions, be not affrighted: for it behooveth these things first to take place; but the end is not immediately.

10. Then He said to them, Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:

11. and there shall be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in divers places; and there shall be great terrors and signs from heaven.

12. And before all of these things, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you into their synagogues and prisons, led before kings and governors on account of my name.

13. And it shall come to pass to you for a testimony.

14. Place it in your hearts, not to premeditate your defense:

15. for I will give to you mouth and wisdom, which all who are opposed to you will not be able to gainsay nor resist.

16. And you shall be delivered up also by your parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and they will kill some of you.

17. And you shall be hated by all, on account of my name:

18. and not a hair from your head shall perish.

19. In your patience gain your souls.

20. And when you may see Jerusalem shut up by the armies, then know that her desolation is nigh.

21. Then let those in Judea fly to the mountains; and let those in the midst of it depart out; and let not those in the country come into it.

22. Because these are the days of vengeance, to fill up all things which have been written.

23. But alas to those in gestation and nursing in those days! For there shall be great distress upon the earth, and wrath to this people.

24. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles may be fulfilled.

25. And there will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and commotion of the nations of the earth in their perplexity, the sea and the wave roaring;

26. the souls of men failing from fear, and expectation of those things coming upon the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

27. And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. And these things beginning to take place, straighten up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption is nigh.

29. And He spoke a parable to them: Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees:

30. when they may already put forth, seeing, know for yourselves that summer is nigh.

31. So you also, when you see these things take place, know that the kingdom of God is nigh.

32. Truly I say unto you, that this race may not pass away, until all these things shall be fulfilled.

33. But heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word can not pass away.

34. But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts may be burdened with luxury, and drunkenness, and worldly cares, and that day may come on you unanticipated.

35. For as a lasso it will come upon all the people who are sitting down upon the face of the whole earth.

36. Therefore watch, praying all the time, that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things which are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. And He was teaching in the temple during the days; and during the nights going out, He was lodging in the mountain called Mount of Olives.

38. And all the people gathered in the temple to hear Him. 

## Luke 22

1. And the feast of the unleavened bread, called the passover, was nigh.

2. And the chief priests and scribes were seeking how they might kill Him; for they feared the people.

3. And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

4. And having gone away, he spoke with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray Him to them.

5. And they rejoiced, and promised to give him money.

6. And he promised them, and was seeking an opportunity to deliver Him unto them in the absence of the multitude.

7. And the day of the unleavened bread came, in which it behooved to slay the passover.

8. And He sent Peter and John, saying, Going prepare for us the passover, in order that we may eat it.

9. And they said to Him, Where do you wish that we may prepare it?

10. And He said to them, Behold, you having come into the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he is going.

11. And say to the landlord, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there prepare.

13. And having gone away, they found as He told them; and prepared the passover.

14. And when the hour arrived, He sat down and the apostles along with Him.

15. And He said to them, I desired with desire to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say to you,

16. I eat this no more, until it may be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And receiving the cup, having given thanks, He said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves;

18. for I say to you, I shall from now drink no more from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God may come.

19. And taking bread, blessing it, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body given for you: do this in remembrance of me.

20. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out in your behalf.

21. Moreover behold, the hand of the one betraying me is with me at the table.

22. Indeed the Son of man goes, according to that which has been appointed: but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!

23. And they began to inquire among themselves, who then of them is the one of them about to do this.

24. And there was a contention among them, which one of them seems to be the greater,

25. And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles domineer over them; and those exercising authority over them are called Benefactors.

26. But you are not thus: but let the greater among you be as the younger; and the leader as the waiter.

27. For which is the greater, he that sitteth at the table, or the waiter? is not the one sitting? but I am in the midst of you as the waiter.

28. But you are those who have remained with me in my temptations.

29. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father appointed unto me,

30. in order that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. Simon, Simon, behold, Satan sought you out, to sift you as wheat:

32. but I prayed for you, that your faith may not fail you: and thou, when having turned, strengthen thy brethren:

33. but he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee to prison and to death.

34. And He said; I say unto thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

35. Then He said to them, When I sent you without purse, and valise, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said; Nothing.

36. And He said to them; But now, let the one having a purse, take it, likewise also valise: and let the one having no sword, sell his cloak and buy one.

37. For I say unto you, that it behooves that which has been written to be perfected in me, this, And He was numbered with the transgressors: for indeed that which is concerning me has an end.

38. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is sufficient.

39. And having gone out, He departed, according to custom, into the Mount of Olives; and His disciples followed Him.

40. He being at the place, He said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.

41. And He was separated from them about a stone's cast; and putting down His knees, continued to pray,

42. saying, Father, if this cup is willing to pass from me; moreover let not my will, but thine be done.

43. And an angel from heaven appeared unto Him, strengthening Him.

44. And being in agony He continued to pray the more earnestly. And His sweat was like drops of blood falling down upon the ground.

45. And having risen from prayer, having come to His disciples, He found them sleeping on account of weariness,

46. and He said to them, Why do you sleep? Arising pray, that you may not enter into temptation.

47. And He still speaking, behold, a multitude and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.

48. And Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?

49. And those around Him seeing what was coming on Him, said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

50. And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. And Jesus responding said, Hold on until this: and touching his ear, healed him.

52. Jesus said to the high priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders who were assembled to Him; You have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs.

53. I being daily with you in the temple, you reached not out your hands unto me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

54. And taking Him, they led Him away, and led Him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed Him a long way off.

55. And having lighted a fire in the midst of the court, and they sitting together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them.

56. And a certain maidservant, seeing him sitting at the fire, and fixing her eyes on him, said, This man was with Him.

57. And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I know Him not.

58. And after a brief interval another seeing him, said, Truly, thou art one of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And about one hour having elapsed, a certain other man accosted him, saying, He was truly with Him: for he is a Galilean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I know Him not. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock crew.

61. And the Lord turning, looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He said to him, that, Before the cock shall crow thou shalt deny me thrice.

62. And having gone out, he wept bitterly.

63. And the men having Him, began to mock, beating Him,

64. and covering Him, they continued to ask saying, Prophesy, who is the one smiting thee.

65. And blaspheming, they continued to speak many other things against Him.

66. And when it was day, the eldership of the people was convened, and the chief priests and scribes, and they led Him into their sanhedrim.

67. Saying, If thou art the Christ, tell us. And He said to them, If I may tell you, you will not believe:

68. and if indeed I will ask you, you will not respond to me, or release me.

69. And from now the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.

70. And all said, Art thou the Son of God? And He said to them, You say that I am.

71. And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we heard from His own mouth. 

## Luke 23

1. And all the multitude of them rising up, lead Him to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found Him perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that He is Christ, a King.

3. And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And responding to him, He said, Thou sayest it.

4. And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing criminal in this man.

5. And they became stronger and stronger, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee unto this place.

6. And Pilate hearing, asked if He is a Galilean man.

7. And learning that He is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent Him up to Herod, being himself in Jerusalem in those days.

8. And Herod seeing Jesus, rejoiced exceedingly: for from a long time, wishing to see Him, because He was hearing about Him; and he was hoping to see some miracle wrought by Him.

9. And he asked Him with many words; and He responded to him nothing.

10. But the high priest and scribes stood by, accusing Him vehemently.

11. But Herod along with his soldiers having indeed treated Him with contempt, and mocked Him, putting on Him a scarlet robe, sent Him back to Pilate.

12. And both Herod and Pilate on that day became friends with one another: for they were hitherto in enmity either to other.

13. Pilate having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. said to them, You have brought to me this man, as revolutionizing the people: and behold, I, judging Him before you, found nothing in this man criminal of those things which you accuse against Him.

15. But Herod did not: for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.

16. Therefore having scourged Him, I will release Him.

17. And they unanimously cried out, saying, Take Him away, and release unto us Barabbas:

18. who had been cast into prison on account of certain sedition made in the city, and murder.

19. Then Pilate again called to them, wishing to release Jesus.

20. And they continued to shout aloud, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him.

21. And he spoke to them the third time, For what evil hath He done? I found nothing in Him worthy of death: therefore having scourged Him, I will release Him.

22. And they continued to lay on with great voices, demanding that He should be crucified: and the voices of them and the high priests continued to grow stronger.

23. And Pilate decided that their request should be granted.

24. And released him who on account of sedition and murder had been cast into prison, and delivered up Jesus according to their wish.

25. And when they were leading Him away, taking a certain Simon, a Cyrenean, coming from the country, they placed the cross on him, to carry it after Jesus.

26. And a great multitude of people followed Him, and of women who were both weeping and bewailing Him.

27. And Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and your children.

28. Because behold, the days are coming, in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not bring forth, and the breasts that did not nurse.

29. Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Hide us.

30. Because if they do these things in the green tree, what may be done in the dry?

31. And two malefactors were also led away with Him, to be executed.

32. And when they came to the place called Calvary.There they crucified Him, and the malefactors, one on the right and one on the left.

33. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they were casting the lots.

34. The people stood looking: and the rulers were even mocking with themselves, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the elect of God.

35. And the soldiers were also mocking, coming and bringing the vinegar to Him,

36. and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.

37. And the superscription was also over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. And one of the malefactors having been hung up, continued to blaspheme Him, saying, If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.

39. But the other one responding, rebuked him saying, Do you not fear God, because you are in the same condemnation?

40. and we indeed justly; for we are receiving the deservings of the things we did: but this one has done nothing amiss.

41. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou mayest come in thy kingdom.

42. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say unto thee, This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.

43. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

44. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle.

45. And calling with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, He expired.

46. And the centurion seeing that which took place, glorified God, saying, Surely this was a righteous man.

47. And all the multitudes being present at that scene, seeing those things which took place, were going away beating their breasts.

48. And all His acquaintances stood a great way off and the women who having followed along with Him from Galilee, seeing these things.

49. And behold, there was a man by name Joseph, being a councilor, a good and righteous man,

50. (for he was not consenting unto their counsel and deed), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God.

51. He having come to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus.

52. And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a hewn sepulcher, where no one ever was laid.

53. And it was Preparation day, and the Sabbath was drawing nigh.

54. And the women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed down, saw the sepulcher, and where His body was placed.

55. And having returned, they prepared aromatics and myrrh: and they kept the Sabbath according to the commandment. 

## Luke 24

1. And on the first of the Sabbath, at the depth of the dawn, they came to the sepulcher, bearing the aromatics which they had prepared,

2. And they found the stone, having been rolled away from the sepulcher.

3. And coming in they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it came to pass, while they were at a loss concerning this, and behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

5. and they being afraid, and turning their face towards the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but He is risen. Remember how He spoke to you, being with you in Galilee,

7. Saying That it behooveth the Son of man to be delivered into the hands of sinners, and to be crucified, and to rise again on the third day.

8. And they remembered His words.

9. And having returned from the sepulcher, they proclaimed all these things to the eleven, and all the rest.

10. And Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them spoke these things to the apostles.

11. And their words appeared before them like a dream; and they doubted them.

12. And behold, two of them on that day were journeying to a village, distant from Jerusalem sixty furlongs, to which was the name Emmaus:

13. and they were conversing with one another concerning all those things which had transpired.

14. And it came to pass, while they are talking and making inquiry, Jesus Himself also having come nigh, journeyed along with them:

15. and their eyes were held so as not to recognize Him.

16. And He said to them, What speeches are these which you are interchanging to one another, walking along? And they stood still, looking sad.

17. And one, whose name was Cleopas, said to Him, Dost thou only sojourn at Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?

18. And He said to them, What? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet-man mighty in work and word before God and all the people.

19. How the chief priests and our rulers indeed delivered Him up to the condemnation of death, and they crucified Him.

20. But we were hoping that He is the one about to redeem Israel: but truly in addition to all these things, this is the third day from which these things took place.

21. But certain women from us truly surprised us, being early at the sepulcher;

22. and not seeing His body, came, saying, they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that He is alive.

23. And certain ones of those with us went away to the sepulcher, and found as the women also said: and they saw Him not.

24. And He said to them, O ye foolish, and slow in heart to believe in all those things which the prophet spoke!

25. Did it not behoove Christ to suffer, and to enter into His glory?

26. And beginning from Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning Himself.

27. And they drew nigh to the village, whither they were going: and He made as though He would go further:

28. and they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us: because it is at the evening, and the day has already declined. And He came in to abide with them.

29. And it came to pass, while He was reclining with them at the table, taking bread, He blessed it, and breaking it, He gave it to them:

30. and their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He vanished from them.

31. And they said to one another, Did not our heart bum within us, while He was talking to us on the way, as He was expounding the Scriptures to us?

32. And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those with them gathered together,

33. saying, The Lord indeed is risen, and was seen by Simon.

34. And they expounded those things on the way, and bow He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

35. And they speaking these things, He stood in their midst,

36. and they being affrighted and filled with fear, thought they saw a spirit.

37. And He said to them, Why are you excited, and why do reasonings arise in your heart?

38. See my hands and my feet, that I am He: feel me; and see, because a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me having.

39. And they still disbelieving from joy, and wondering, He said to them, Have you here any edible?

40. And they gave Him a piece of baked fish:

41. and taking it, He did eat in their presence.

42. And He said to them, These are my words which I spoke to you, being still with you, that it behooves all things which have been written concerning me in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms, to be fulfilled.

43. Then He opened their mind, that they might understand the Scriptures.

44. And He said to them, As it has been written, That Christ must suffer, and rise from the dead on the third day;

45. and repentance unto remission of sins is to be preached in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

46. You are witnesses of these things.

47. And I send the promise of the Father upon you: and you tarry in the city, until you may be endued with power from on high.

48. And He led them out even unto Bethany; and having lifted up His hands, He blessed them.

49. And it came to pass, while He was blessing them, He departed from them, and was carried up into heaven.

50. And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

51. and were constantly in the temple, praising God.
