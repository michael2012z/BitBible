# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God which is at Corinth, along with all the saints who are in all Achaia:

2. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation;

4. the one comforting us in all our tribulation, in order that we may be able to comfort those in all tribulation, through the consolation with which we ourselves are comforted of God,

5. because as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation through Christ also abounds.

6. But if we are troubled it is in behalf of your consolation and salvation; if we are comforted, it is in behalf of your consolation, working in you through the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.

7. And our hope is stedfast in your behalf; knowing that, as you are the partakers of the sufferings, so you are also of the consolation.

8. For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction taking place in Asia, because we were burthened exceedingly, above our power, so that we despaired even of living:

9. but we had the answer of death in ourselves, in order that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raised the dead:

10. who delivered us from so great a death, and will deliver: in whom he have hope that he will also yet deliver;

11. you also cooperating in our behalf in prayer; in order that, the gift which is bestowed upon us from many persons, may through many be a source of thanks given in our behalf.

12. For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and purity of God, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have sojourned in the world, and especially towards you.

13. For we do not write other things to you, but those things which you read and know, and I hope that you will know them perfectly:

14. as you have also known us in part, because we are your glorying, as you ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.

15. And in this confidence I wished to come unto you sooner, that you may have a second grace;

16. and through you to go unto Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent forward into Judea.

17. Then wishing this, whether did I use lightness of purpose? or the things which I counsel, do I counsel according to the flesh, in order that it may be with me yes yes and no no?

18. But God is faithful, that our word which is to you is not yes and no.

19. For Christ Jesus, the Son of God, the one being preached by us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but it was yes in him.

20. For so many promises of God, in Him are yes; therefore indeed through him they are Amen unto the glory to God through us.

21. But the one confirming us along with you unto Christ, and having anointed us, is God.

22. Who also having sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

23. But I call God to witness to my soul, that sparing you I did not yet come into Corinth:

24. not that we domineer over your faith, but we are fellow-workers of your joy: for by faith you stand. 

## 2 Corinthians 2

1. But I determined this to myself, not again to come unto you in sorrow.

2. For if I grieve you, who indeed is the one giving me joy, except the one being grieved by me?

3. And I wrote this same thing, in order that, having come, I may not have grief over those from whom it behooves me to rejoice; and having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

4. For out of much tribulation and anguish of heart, I wrote to you through many tears; not in order that you may be grieved, but that you may know the divine love which I have unto you exceedingly.

5. But if any one has grieved you all, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I may not burden you excessively.

6. This punishment which for many to such a one is sufficient;

7. so on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one may be swallowed up with excessive grief.

8. Therefore I exhort you to stir up your divine love for him:

9. for unto this also I wrote, in order that I may know your approval, if you are obedient in all things.

10. But to whom you forgive anything, I do also: for indeed whatsoever I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sakes in the face of Christ;

11. in order that we may not be gobbled up by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

12. And having come into Troas, for the gospel of Christ, and there being a door opened unto me in the Lord,

13. and I had no rest to my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus: but having bidden them adieu, I came away into Macedonia.

14. But thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and manifesting the fragrance of his knowledge through us in every place:

15. because we are a sweet savour of Christ unto God, among those who are saved, and among those who perish;

16. unto the latter a savour from death unto death; but unto the former a savour from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?

17. For we are not as many, corrupting the word of God: but as of purity, but as from God, we speak in Christ, in the presence of God. 

## 2 Corinthians 3

1. Do we again begin to commend ourselves? or whether have we need of commendatory letters to you or from you, as some do?

2. You are our letter, having been written in our hearts, known and read of all men,

3. being manifest that you are the letter of Christ, having been ministered by us, having been written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God: not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.

4. But we have such confidence through Christ towards God,

5. not that we are able of ourselves to think anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

6. who also rendered us able ministers of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit creates life.

7. But if the ministry of death, having been written in letters of stone, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look upon the face of Moses on account of the glory of his countenance; which was destined to be done away:

8. how will not the ministry of the spirit be more in glory?

9. For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, how much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.

10. For indeed that which was glorious, has ceased to be glorious in this respect on account of the transcendent glory.

11. For if that which was to be done away was through glory, much more is that which abides in glory.

12. Then having such hope, we use great boldness,

13. and not as Moses put the veil on his face, in order that the sons of Israel might not look forward to the end of that which was transitory.

14. But their minds were darkened. For until this day the same veil remains in the reading of the old covenant, remains, not lifted; because it is done away in Christ;

15. but until this day when Moses is read, the veil lies upon their heart:

16. but when they may turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.

17. But the Lord is a Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

18. But we all, with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 

## 2 Corinthians 4

1. Therefore having this ministry, as we have obtained mercy, we faint not;

2. but we lay aside the hidden things of disgrace, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but in the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men, before God.

3. But if indeed our gospel is hidden, it is hidden with those who are lost:

4. in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who believe not, in order that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, may not shine on them.

5. For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

6. Because God is the one, having said; Out of the darkness the light shall shine, which shone in our hearts, to the enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, in order that the excellency of the power, may be of God, and not of us;

8. in everything being troubled, but not in difficulties incorrigible; being at a loss, but not utterly at a loss;

9. being persecuted, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not destroyed;

10. always bearing about the dying of Jesus in our body, in order that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our bodies.

11. For we while living are always being delivered up to death for the sake of Jesus, in order that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

12. So that death works in us, but life in you.

13. But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which has been written, I believed, therefore I also spoke; and we believe, therefore we also speak;

14. knowing that the one having raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us along with Jesus, and present us with you.

15. For all things are for your sakes, in order that the grace, overflowing with thanksgiving through many, may abound unto the glory of God.

16. Therefore we faint not; but if indeed our external man perishes, yet our internal man is renewed day by day.

17. For the light burden of our affliction, which is evanescent, is working out for us an eternal weight of glory according to hyperbole unto hyperbole;

18. we not looking at the things which are visible, but the things which are invisible; for the visible things are temporary, but the invisible things are eternal. 

## 2 Corinthians 5

1. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle may be taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.

2. For in this we groan, longing to be invested with our house which is from heaven:

3. if indeed having been invested, we shall not be found unclothed.

4. For indeed being in this tabernacle we groan, being burdened; not that we wish to be divested, but invested, that mortality may be swallowed up of life.

5. But the one having wrought us out unto this same thing is God, the one having given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

6. Therefore we are always confident even knowing that, being present in the body, we are absent from the Lord;

7. (for we walk by faith, not by sight);

8. but we are confident and delighted rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.

9. Therefore we are truly ambitious, whether being present or absent, to be well pleasing unto him.

10. For it behooves us all to appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive according to those things which he has done through the body, whether good or evil.

11. Therefore knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we have been made manifest unto God; and I hope that we have indeed been made manifest in your consciences.

12. We are not commending ourselves to you, but giving you occasion of boasting in our behalf, in order that you may have response to those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.

13. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we have our right minds, it is for you.

14. For the love of Christ constrains us; having judged this, that one died for all; then were all dead;

15. and he died for all, in order that those living may not live unto themselves, but unto him who died for them and is risen.

16. So that we from now know no man after the flesh: if indeed we have known Christ after the flesh, but we now know him no more.

17. So if any one is in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.

18. All things are from God, the one having reconciled us unto himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,

19. as that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their transgressions to them, even having placed in us the word of reconciliation.

20. Therefore we are embassadors in behalf of Christ, as God is intreating you through us; we pray you in behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.

21. He made him sin in our behalf, who knew no sin; in order that we may become the righteousness of God in him. 

## 2 Corinthians 6

1. But working together we indeed intreat you not to have received the grace of God in vain:

2. (for he says, At a set time I heard you, and in the day of salvation I assisted you; behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation);

3. giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, in order that the ministry may not be blamed;

4. but in everything commending ourselves, as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in straits, in difficulties,

5. in stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in labors, in vigils, in fastings;

6. by purity, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

7. by the word of truth, by the power of God; through the arms of righteousness right and left,

8. through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and true;

9. as being unknown, and perfectly known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed;

10. as sorrowing, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.

11. Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.

12. Be not straitened in reference to us, but be straitened in your own affections.

13. But as I speak to children, you indeed receive this reward.

14. Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what participation is there to righteousness and unrighteousness? or what fellowship has light unto darkness?

15. What concord of Christ unto Belial? or what part has a faithful man with an infidel?

16. And what harmony has the temple of God with idols? for we are the temple of the living God; as God said; I will live in them, and walk about among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

17. Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be ye separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,

18. and I will be to you for a Father, and you shall be unto me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. 

## 2 Corinthians 7

1. Therefore having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all the filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

2. Receive us: we have injured no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.

3. I do not speak for castigation: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die with you and to live with you.

4. My boldness to you is great, my rejoicing over you is much: I have been filled with consolation, I superabound with joy in all our tribulation.

5. For we having come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but in everything being troubled; fightings without, fears within.

6. But God, the one comforting the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus;

7. and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted by you, proclaiming unto us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.

8. But if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret it, if indeed I did regret it; for I see that, if that letter indeed grieved you for an hour,

9. now I rejoice, not because you grieved, but because you grieved unto repentance: for you grieved toward God, in order that you may receive damage by us in nothing.

10. For a godly sorrow works repentance unto salvation not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world works out death.

11. For behold, how great enthusiasm, yes, how great apology, yes, how great clearing up, yes, how great fear, yes, how great longing, yes, how great zeal, yes, how great avenging, this same godly sorrow did work in you! In everything you have established yourselves to be pure in the matter.

12. Since then indeed I wrote to you, not on account of the one having done the wrong, nor on account of the one having suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal, which is in our behalf to you before God, might be made manifest.

13. Therefore we have been comforted. But we rejoiced the more exceedingly in our consolation over the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all:

14. because if I have gloried with him in anything over you, I wag not made ashamed; but as I spoke all things to you in truth, so our rejoicing over Titus was true.

15. And the affections of him, remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling, are the more abundantly towards you.

16. I rejoice because in everything I have confidence in you. 

## 2 Corinthians 8

1. But, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;

2. because in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

3. Because I witness, that according to their ability, and beyond their ability they were anxious,

4. with much exhortation praying our favor and the fellowship of the ministry which is to the saints:

5. and not as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God:

6. that we should exhort Titus, that as he formerly began it, he may indeed also complete this grace unto you.

7. But as in every thing you abound, in faith, and in word, and knowledge, and in all zeal, and in divine love from you in us, that you may also abound in this philanthropy.

8. I speak not according to commandment, but through the zeal of others also proving the sincerity of your divine love.

9. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, being rich, for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be made rich.

10. And herein I give my judgement: for this is profitable to you, who not only began to do, but to be anxious, a year ago:

11. but now indeed complete the work; in order that as there was a promptitude of willing, there shall also be a completion out of your ability.

12. For if there is first a willing mind, it is acceptable according to what one may have, and not according to what he has not.

13. For it is not that there may be relief to others, affliction to you, but that it may be according to equality: at this time your abundance may correspond to their deficiency,

14. that their abundance may correspond with your deficiency, in order that there may be equality:

15. as has been written, He that had much did not super-abound; and he that had little did not lack.

16. But thanks be unto God, who gives this same enthusiasm in your behalf in the heart of Titus;

17. because he indeed accepted our exhortation; and being the more enthusiastic, came unto you of his own accord.

18. But we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is through all the churches;

19. not only so, but having been elected by the churches our traveling companion with this philanthropy, administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and your promptitude:

20. and avoiding this, lest any one may blame us in this benefaction administered by us:

21. for we provide things honest, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also before the people.

22. And we sent our brother along with him to them, whom we have tried, being frequently zealous in many things, but now much more zealous, with great confidence towards you.

23. Whether in behalf of Titus, my companion and fellow-laborer towards you; or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.

24. Moreover manifesting the exhibition of your love, and our boasting to them in your behalf, in the face of the churches. 

## 2 Corinthians 9

1. For indeed concerning the ministry which is to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.

2. For I know your promptitude, of which I am boasting to the Macedonians in your behalf, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has aroused many.

3. But I sent the brethren, in order that our boasting which is in your behalf may not be in vain in this region; in order that, as I was saying, your were ready:

4. lest perhaps, if the Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we may be put to shame, in this confidence, (that we may say not, you).

5. Therefore I considered it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they may come to you beforehand, and perfect your preannounced benefaction, that it may be ready, as a benefaction, not as a stingy contribution.

6. But it is this, he that soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall also reap bountifully.

7. As each one has predetermined in his heart; not of reluctance, or of constraint: for God loves the hilarious giver.

8. But God is able to make all grace abound unto you; in order that, always having all sufficiency in every thing, you may abound unto every good work: as has been written,

9. He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.

10. But he that gives seed to the sower, will also give bread to the eater, and multiply your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:

11. in every thing being enriched in all purity, which works out through us thanksgiving to God.

12. Because the ministry of this free-will offering is not only supplying the deficiencies of the saints, but also superabounding through much thanksgiving to God;

13. through the approval of this ministry, glorifying God in the submission of your testimony to the gospel of Christ, and the purity of your fellowship unto them and unto all;

14. and through their prayer in your behalf, earnestly longing to see you on account of the grace of God superabounding unto you.

15. Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift. 

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. But I Paul exhort you through the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who before your face am indeed humble among you, but being absent am bold towards you:

2. but I pray, that being present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I consider myself bold towards certain ones who regard us as walking about according to the flesh.

3. For walking in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh;

4. for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God unto the pulling down of strongholds;

5. casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

6. and being ready to avenge every disobedience, when your obedience may be complete.

7. Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If any has trusted to himself that he belongs to Christ, let him again consider this in reference to himself, that as he belongs to Christ, so do we also.

8. For if I shall in any thing the more abundantly boast concerning our power which the Lord gave us for your edification, and not for your destruction, I will not be ashamed:

9. in order that I may not seem as it were to terrify you by my letters.

10. Because they say, His letters are indeed weighty and powerful; but the presence of his body is weak, and his speech contemptible.

11. Let such a one consider this, that, such as we are in word by our letters while absent, such we really are in work being present.

12. For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain ones of those who recommend themselves: but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, are not wise.

13. But we will not boast in things without measure, but according to the measure of the rule which measure God has measured to us, to reach even unto you.

14. For not as not reaching unto you do we stretch ourselves, for we have advanced in the gospel of Christ even unto you:

15. and not boasting in things without measure, in the labors of others, but having hope of your faith increasing among you, to be magnified according to our rule exceedingly,

16. to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to glory according to the rule of others in things made ready.

17. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord;

18. for he that commends himself is not approved, but whom the Lord commends. 

## 2 Corinthians 11

1. I would that you bear with me a little in my folly: yes indeed you do bear with me.

2. For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God: for I espoused you to one husband, to present you a pure virgin to Christ;

3. but I fear, lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.

4. For if indeed one coming preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive another spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel which you did not receive, well do you bear with him.

5. For I consider that I am not inferior to the chief of the apostles.

6. If indeed rude in speech, but not in knowledge; but in every thing making manifest unto you in all things.

7. Did I commit sin humbling myself that you may be exalted, because I preached unto you the gospel of God gratuitously?

8. I robbed other churches, having received support for your ministry, and being present with you and being destitute, I burdened no one;

9. for the brethren, having come from Macedonia, supplied my deficiency; and in everything I rendered myself not burdensome to you, and will so render.

10. The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not cease unto me in the regions of Achaia.

11. Why? because I do not love you with divine love? God knows.

12. But what I am doing, I indeed will do, in order that I may cut off occasion from those wishing occasion, in order that in whatsoever they may glory, they may be found even as we are.

13. For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

14. And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

15. Then it is no great wonder if his ministers are transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose, end shall be according to their works.

16. Again I say, Let no one consider me to be a fool; but if not, receive me as a fool, in order that I may indeed glory some little.

17. What I say, I am not saying according to the Lord, but as it were in folly, in this confidence of glorying.

18. Since many glory in the flesh, I will glory also.

19. For cheerfully do you, being wise, bear with the foolish:

20. for you bear with them, if any one enslaves you, if any one devours you, if any one captures you, if any one is exalted against you, if any one smites you in the face.

21. I speak according to disparagement, as that we are weak; but in whatsoever any one is bold, (I speak it in folly,) I am bold also.

22. Are they Hebrews? I am also. Are they Israelites? I am also. Are they the seed of Abraham? I am also.

23. Are they the ministers of Christ? (I speak as a mad man,) I am more; in labors more abundantly, in stripes more abundantly, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;

24. from the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one,

25. thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice was I shipwrecked, a day and a night I spent in the deep.

26. Often in journeys, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;

27. in labor and in toil, in vigils often, in hunger and in thirst, in fastings often, in cold and in nakedness.

28. Besides all these, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I do not burn?

30. But if it behooves me to glory, I will glory in those things appertaining to my infirmities.

31. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one being blessed forever, knows that I lie not.

32. In Damascus Areta the governor of the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to arrest me:

33. and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands. 

## 2 Corinthians 12

1. It behooves me to glory, indeed it is not profitable, I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.

2. I knew a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, whether in the body, I know not; whether out of the body, I know not, such a one having been caught up even to the third heaven.

3. And I knew such a man, whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not; God knows,

4. that he was caught up to Paradise, and heard unutterable words, which it is impossible for a man to speak.

5. Concerning such a one I will glory: but concerning myself I will not glory, except in my infirmities.

6. For if I shall wish to glory, I will not be a fool; for I speak the truth: but I fear, lest some one may consider with reference to me above what he sees me, or hears from me.

7. And that I may not be exalted by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given unto me in the flesh, the messenger of Satan that he may buffet me, in order that I may not be exalted.

8. Three times I called on the Lord concerning this, that it may depart from me.

9. And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore most delightfully I will glory the more in my infirmities, in order that the power of Christ may abide on me.

10. Therefore I delight in infirmities, in insults, in difficulties, in persecutions, and in tight places, for Christ's sake: for when I am without strength, then I am dynamite.

11. I have become a fool: you did compel me. For I ought to be commended by you: for I am not inferior to the very chief of the apostles, if indeed I am nothing.

12. For indeed the signs of the apostleship are wrought in me in all patience, in miracles and in wonders and in dynamites.

13. For what is that in which you are inferior to other churches, except that I did not burden you? forgive me this wrong.

14. Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not spare: for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the parents for the children,

15. But I will most delightfully spend and be spent for your souls. If the more abundantly I love you am I loved the less?

16. But let it he so, I did not burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.

17. Which one of those whom I sent unto you, did I fleece you through him?

18. I called Titus, and sent the brother along with him: whether did Titus defraud you? did we not walk by the same Spirit? did we not in the same tracks?

19. For a long time you were thinking that I am apologizing to you. We speak before God in Christ; but all things, beloved, are for your edification.

20. For I fear lest, having come, I may not find you as I wish, and may not be found by you as you wish; lest perhaps strife, jealousy, animosities, selfseekings, calumniations, eavesdroppings, inflations, outfallings, are among you;

21. lest, I again having come, my God will humble me before you, and I will mourn over many of those having previously committed sins, and not having repented over the uncleanness and the fornication and debauchery which they have done. 

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. This the third time I am coming to you: in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.

2. I have told you beforehand, and I am speaking to you in advance, as being present the second time, even now absent, that, if I may come to you again, I will not spare those who have previously sinned, and all the rest;

3. since you are seeking the approval of Christ, who is speaking in me, who is not weak towards you, bit mighty among you.

4. For indeed he was crucified from weakness, but he lives by the power of God: for we indeed are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God unto you.

5. Prove your own selves, if you are in the faith; examine yourselves; whether do you not know yourselves, that Christ Jesus is in you? unless indeed you are reprobates.

6. But I hope that you shall know that we are not reprobates.

7. But we are praying unto God, that he may do you no evil, not in order that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and we may be as disapproved.

8. For we are not able to do any thing against the truth, but for the truth.

9. For we rejoice when we may be weak, and you may be strong: we are praying for even this, your perfection.

10. Therefore being absent I write these things, in order that being present, I may not use severity, according to the power which the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction.

11. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect; be of good comfort; think the same thing, live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.

12. Salute one another with a holy kiss.

13. All the saints salute you.

14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
