# Galatians

## Galatians 1

1. Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,

2. and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.

3. Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,

4. who gave Himself for our sins, in order that he might redeem us from the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father:

5. To whom be glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.

6. I am astonished that you are so quickly removed from him who called you in the grace of Christ into another gospel;

7. which is not another: but there are certain ones who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the gospel of Christ.

8. But indeed if we, or an angel from heaven, may preach unto you any other gospel except that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

9. As we have before said, and now again I tell you, If any one preaches to you a gospel except that which you have received, let him be accursed.

10. For must I now believe men, or God? whether do I seek to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I would not be the servant of Christ.

11. But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel was preached to me, that it is not according to a man;

12. for I did not receive it from man, neither was I taught it, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ.

13. For you have heard of my life formerly in Judaism, that I was persecuting the church of God exceedingly, and destroying it:

14. and I was prominent in Judaism above many comrades in my race, being exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

15. When the one having separated me, from the womb of my mother, and called me through his grace, was pleased

16. to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

17. neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.

18. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and remained with him fifteen days;

19. but I saw no other of the apostles, except James the brother of the Lord.

20. Which things moreover I write unto you, behold, before God, that I lie not.

21. Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

22. But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.

23. But they were only hearing that The one persecuting us at one time is now preaching the faith which he was once desolating;

24. and they continued to glorify God in me. 

## Galatians 2

1. Then after fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus with me;

2. but I went up according to revelation; and I presented to them the gospel which I am preaching among the Gentiles, but privately to the prominent ones, lest perhaps I am running, or did run, in vain.

3. But neither was Titus the one with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised:

4. but on account of the false brethren having crept in, who came in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they shall bring us into bondage:

5. to whom I rendered not submission for an hour; in order that the truth of the gospel may abide with you.

6. But of those seeming to be something what they were at that time makes no difference to me: God does not receive the face of man: for those seeming to me to be prominent added nothing extra:

7. but on the contrary, seeing that I am intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, like Peter of the circumcision,

8. for the one having wrought with Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision also wrought with me unto the Gentiles:

9. and having known the grace of God which was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, who seem to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;

10. only that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.

11. And when Cephas came into Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to blame.

12. For before certain ones came from James, he was eating along with the Gentiles: but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.

13. And the rest of the Jews also reciprocated with him; so that even Barnabas was led away by their dissimulation.

14. But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, If you being a Jew are living like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how do you compel the Gentiles to judaize?

15. We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

16. knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus, and we have believed into Christ Jesus, in order that we may be justified by faith of Christ, and not by works of law, because by works of law no flesh shall be justified.

17. But if seeking to be justified in Christ, we may also be found sinners, then is Christ the minister of sin? it could not be so.

18. For if I again build the things which I have destroyed, I constitute myself a transgressor.

19. For I through law died to law, in, order that I may live unto God.

20. I am crucified along with Christ; and I live no longer, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

21. I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness was through law, then Christ died gratuitiously. 

## Galatians 3

1. O foolish Galatians, who has been bewitching you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was set forth having been crucified?

2. I only wish to learn this from you, Did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by hearing of faith?

3. Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect in the flesh?

4. Have you suffered so many things in vain? if indeed in vain.

5. Then did the one imparting to you the Spirit, and working miracles, among you, do it by works of law, or by hearing of faith?

6. As Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

7. Then know that those who are of faith, the same are the sons of Abraham.

8. But the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, That in thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.

9. Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

10. For so many as are of works of law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who does not abide in all things which have been written in the book of the law, to do the same.

11. But that no one is justified by law in the sight of God, is evident: because, The just shall live by faith:

12. though the law is not of faith; but the one having done these things shall live in them.

13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: because it has been written; Cursed is every one having been hung on the wood:

14. in order that the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus may come to the Gentiles; in order that we may receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

15. Brethren, I speak according to a man, nevertheless no one disannuls, or adds to, the covenant of a man which has been confirmed.

16. But the promises were spoken to Abraham and his seed. He does not say, And unto seeds, as of many; but as of one; And thy seed, which is Christ.

17. And I say this; The law which was given after four hundred and thirty years, does not disannul the covenant which had been before confirmed of God, so as to make the promise of none effect.

18. For if the inheritance were by law, it is no more by promise: but God gave it to Abraham through the promise.

19. Then what is the law? It was added on account of the transgressions, until the seed to whom the promise was made should come; being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

20. A mediator is not of one; but God is one.

21. Then was the law against the promises of God? it could not be so. For if the law was given being able to create life, truly justification would have been by law:

22. but the scripture has shut up all things unto sin, in order that the promise through faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those who believe.

23. But before faith came, we were kept under law, being shut up to the faith about to be revealed.

24. Therefore the law became our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be justified by faith;

25. but faith having come, we are no longer under the schoolmaster.

26. For you are all the sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus;

27. for so many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

28. There is no longer Jew nor Greek, nor bond nor free, nor male and female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

29. But if you belong to Christ then you are the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. 

## Galatians 4

1. But I say, so long as the heir is an infant, he differs not from a slave, being lord of all things,

2. but he is under nurses and stewards until the adoption of the father.

3. So also we, when we were infants, were enslaved under the elements of the world:

4. but when the fulness of time came, God sent forth his own Son, having been born of a woman, having been born under law,

5. in order that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive the adoption of sonship.

6. But because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his own Son into our hearts, crying, Father, Father.

7. So you are no longer a servant but a son; and if a son, truly an heir through God.

8. But you indeed, not knowing God, at that time served those who by nature are not gods:

9. but now having known God, and rather having become known of God, how do you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements which you wish to serve again as formerly?

10. Do you keep days, and months, and times and years?

11. I fear lest I have labored unto you in vain.

12. Be ye as I am, because I am as you are, brethren, I am praying for you.

13. You have not injured me: you know that through weakness of the flesh I formerly preached the gospel unto you:

14. and you did not despise, nor spit upon, your temptation in my flesh; but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.

15. Where then is your happiness? for I testify to you that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, you would have given them to me.

16. Therefore have I become your enemy, telling you the truth?

17. They zealously seek you in no good way; but they wish to exclude you, in order that you may zealously seek them.

18. It is good always to be zealous in a good thing, and not only in my coming to you.

19. My children, for whom I again travail in pain until Christ may be formed in you,

20. but I wish to come unto you now, and change my voice; because I am at a loss in reference to you.

21. Tell me, you wish to be under law, do you not hear the law?

22. For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one by a bond-maid and one by a freewoman.

23. But the one indeed of the bond-maid was born according to the flesh, and the one of the freewoman through the promise.

24. Which things are allegorized: for these are the two covenants; the one indeed from mount Sinai, generating children into bondage, which is Hagar.

25. For this mount Sinai is in Arabia, and corresponds with Jerusalem which now is: for she is in bondage with her children.

26. But Jerusalem who is above is free, who is our mother:

27. for it is written, Rejoice, thou barren one who does not bring forth; break forth and cry aloud, thou that dost not travail: because many more are the children of the barren than of her having a husband.

28. But you, brethren, are the children of Isaac, according to the promise.

29. But as the one at that time having been born according to the flesh persecuted the one according to the Spirit, even so it is now.

30. But what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not inherit with the son of the free.

31. Therefore, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free. 

## Galatians 5

1. Christ has set you free with freedom, Therefore stand, and be not again entangled with the yoke of bondage.

2. Behold I Paul say unto you, that, if you may be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

3. And again I witness to every man who is circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.

4. You have been divorced from Christ, whosoever are justified by law: you have fallen from grace.

5. For we through the Spirit do await the hope of righteousness through faith.

6. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision or uncircumcision avails anything; but faith working through divine love.

7. You were running well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?

8. The persuasion is not of the one calling you.

9. A little leaven leavens the whole lump.

10. I have confidence in reference to you in the Lord, that you shall be none otherwise minded: but the one troubling you shall bear the judgment, whosoever he may be.

11. But I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? then the offence of the cross would be done away.

12. I would that those troubling you shall indeed cut themselves off.

13. For you were called unto liberty, brethren; only use not the liberty unto an occasion to the flesh, but through divine love serve one another.

14. For the whole law has been fulfilled in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor with divine love as thyself.

15. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you may not be consumed one of another.

16. And I say, Walk about in the Spirit, and do not perfect the lust of carnality.

17. For carnality wars against the Spirit, and the Spirit against carnality; for these are antagonistical to one another; so that you may not do the things which you may wish.

18. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.

19. But the works of carnality are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, debauchery,

20. idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, animosities, selfseekings, divisions, heresies,

21. envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and things like unto these: which I tell you beforehand, as I did previously say to you, that those doing such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

22. But the fruit of the Spirit is divine love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,

23. meekness, holiness; against such things there is no law.

24. But those belonging to Christ Jesus have crucified carnality with the passions and lusts.

25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

26. Let us not be fond of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. 

## Galatians 6

1. Brethren, if indeed a man may be overtaken in some transgression, you who are spiritual, perfect such an one in the spirit of meekness; watching yourself, lest you may also be tempted.

2. Bear the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

3. For if any one seems to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.

4. But let each one prove his own work, and then he shall have rejoicing to himself alone, and not to another;

5. for each one shall bear his own responsibility.

6. But let the one who is taught the word communicate to the one teaching in all good things.

7. Be not deceived; God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man may sow, that shall he also reap:

8. because the one sowing to his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but the one sowing to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.

9. But let us not get weary doing that which is good: for in due time we will reap, fainting not.

10. Then therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.

11. You see with how large letters I have written unto you with my own hand.

12. So many as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised; only that they do not suffer persecution on account of the cross of Christ.

13. For neither do those who are circumcised keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, in order that they may glory in your flesh.

14. But it would be impossible for me to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world:

15. for neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

16. And so many as shall walk by this rule, peace and mercy be unto them, and unto the Israel of God.

17. Finally let no one give me troubles: for I bear in my own body the marks of Jesus.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren: Amen.
