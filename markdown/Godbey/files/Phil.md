# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.

2. Grace and peace unto you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I thank my God for every mention of you,

4. always in all my prayer with joy making supplication,

5. for your fellowship in the gospel from the first clay until now;

6. having confidence as to this same thing, that the one having begun a good work in you will perfect it unto the day of Jesus Christ:

7. as it is righteous for me to think in behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, that you are all my fellow-partakers of the grace.

8. For God is my witness, how I long after you in the affections of Jesus Christ.

9. And I pray this, that your divine love may yet more and more abound in perfect knowledge and all understanding;

10. in order that you may distinguish those things which differ; that you may be pure and without offence in the day of Christ;

11. being filled with the fruit of righteousness, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

12. But I wish you, brethren, to know that the affairs appertaining to me have turned out rather unto the promotion of the gospel.

13. So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the pretorian army, and to all the rest;

14. and many of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are bold to speak the word of God more fluently without fear.

15. Some indeed through envy and strife, and some through good will, are preaching Christ:

16. the latter from divine love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel:

17. the former from self-seeking are proclaiming Christ insincerely, thinking that they will add affliction to my bonds.

18. For what is it? moreover that in every place, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and I rejoice in this, yes, and I will rejoice.

19. For I know that this will turn out to me unto salvation, through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

20. according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.

21. For Christ is my life, and death is my gain.

22. But if to live in the flesh, this shall be to me the fruit of the work, indeed I know not what I shall ask.

23. But I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ; for this is far better:

24. but to remain in the flesh is safer on account of you.

25. And having confidence in this, I know that I shall abide with you all, unto your promotion and the joy of your faith;

26. in order that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may abound in me through my coming again unto you.

27. Only live worthily of the gospel of Christ: in order that, whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I hear those things concerning you, that you are standing in one spirit, with one soul contending for the faith of the gospel;

28. and not being intimidated in anything by the adversaries: which is to them the manifestation of destruction, but of your salvation, and this is from God;

29. because the blessing is conferred on you in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but indeed to suffer for him:

30. having the same conflict as you saw in me, and now hearing me. 

## Philippians 2

1. If then there is any consolation in Christ, if there is any comfort of divine love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercies,

2. fill my joy, that you may think the same thing, having the same divine love, being like-minded, thinking this one thing;

3. that nothing is to be according to self-seeking nor according to vain glory, but in humility esteeming one another better than yourselves;

4. looking not each after your own interests, but each after that of others.

5. Think the same thing among yourselves, which is also in Christ Jesus:

6. who, being in the form of God, thought it not usurpation to be equal with God,

7. but he humbled himself, having taken the form of a servant, being in the likeness of men; and having been found in fashion like a man;

8. he humbled himself, being obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.

9. Therefore God has indeed exalted him, and given him a name above every name;

10. that at the name of Jesus every knee must bow, of things in heaven and things upon the earth and things beneath the earth,

11. and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, unto the glory of God the Father.

12. So, my beloved brethren, as you have always harkened, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;

13. for God is the one working in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.

14. Do all things without murmurings and disputatious;

15. in order that you may be blameless and pure, the children of God, irreproachable, amid a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,

16. having the word of life; unto my boasting in the day of Christ, because I did not run in vain, neither did I labor in vain.

17. But if indeed I am poured out for a sacrifice and an offering for your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice along with you all;

18. but you also rejoice in this same thing, and rejoice along with me.

19. But I hope in the Lord Jesus, speedily to send unto you Timothy, in order that I may also be delighted, having learned the things concerning you.

20. For I have no one like-minded, who will nobly remember the things concerning you;

21. for all are seeking after their own, and not the things of Jesus Christ.

22. But you know his integrity, that, as a child a father, he served along with me in the gospel.

23. Indeed then I hope to send him, so soon as I may learn the things concerning myself:

24. but I trust in the Lord that I myself will come speedily.

25. But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-laborer and fellow-soldier, and apostle and the minister of my necessity;

26. since he was longing after you all, and grieving, because you heard that he was sick.

27. For he was indeed nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not only him, but me also, in order that I may not have sorrow upon sorrow.

28. Therefore I the more diligently, in order that, seeing him, you may rejoice again, and I may not be without sorrow.

29. Then receive him in the Lord with all joy, and have such in honor:

30. because he was nigh unto death on account of the work of Christ, having jeoparded his life, in order that he might fulfill your deficiency of ministry towards me. 

## Philippians 3

1. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you indeed is not burdensome to me, but it is safe to you.

2. Beware of dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the counterfeit circumcision.

3. For we are the circumcision, who serve the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, also having no confidence in the flesh:

4. even though also having confidence in the flesh. If any other one seems to have confidence in the flesh, I the more:

5. in circumcision the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

6. in reference to zeal, persecuting the church, according to righteousness which was in the law being blameless.

7. Those things which were gained to me, these I counted loss for the sake of Christ.

8. Yes truly, I even counted all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I suffer the loss of all things, and I consider them but excrements, that I may gain Christ,

9. and may be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of law, but that which is through faith of Christ, the righteousness of God through faith:

10. to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;

11. if perchance I may attain unto the resurrection which is out from the dead.

12. Not that I already received it, or have already been made perfect: but I persevere, if I may receive that for which I have indeed been received by Christ Jesus.

13. Brethren, I do not consider that I have yet received it;

14. but there is one thing, indeed forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those which are before, I press toward the goal unto the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

15. Therefore let us, so many as are perfect, think the same thing: and if you think otherwise in any respect, God will also reveal this to you:

16. only, whereunto we have already attained, to walk by the same rule.

17. Be ye my imitators, brethren, and mark those thus walking about as you have us an example.

18. For many walk about, of whom I frequently spoke to you, and now I speak even weeping, the enemies of the cross of Christ:

19. whose end is destruction, whose God is their stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.

20. For our citizenship is in the heavens; whence we are indeed looking for our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

21. who will transform the body of our humility, similitudinous to the body of his own glory, according to the energy by which he is able indeed to subdue all things to himself. 

## Philippians 4

1. So, my beloved and longed for brethren, my joy and my crown, stand fast in the Lord, beloved.

2. I exhort, Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.

3. Yea, I also entreat thee, noble yoke-fellow, assist those women, whosoever labored with me in the gospel, both along with Clement, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord always: I say to you again, Rejoice.

5. Let your clemency be made known to all men; the Lord is nigh.

6. Be solicitous about nothing; but in all prayer and supplication, let your request be made known to God.

7. And the peace of God, that passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

8. Finally, brethren, so many things as are true, so many things as are noble, so many things as are righteous, so many things as are pure, so many things as are lovely, so many things as are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think on these things.

9. Whatsoever things you have indeed learned and received and heard and seen in me, do the same: and the God of peace will be with you.

10. But I greatly rejoice in the Lord, because indeed you have at length revived to think about me; in whatsoever you indeed were thinking, nevertheless you lacked opportunity.

11. Not that I speak concerning deficiency: for I have learned to be content with those things amid which I am.

12. I indeed know how to be poor, and I know how to abound: in every thing and in all things I learned both to flourish and to be poor, both to abound and to be destitute.

13. I can do all things through him who fills me up with dynamite.

14. Moreover you did beautifully, communicating with my tribulation.

15. And you indeed know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I came out from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in the word of giving and receiving, except you alone;

16. because also in Thessalonica both once and twice you sent to my need.

17. Not that I seek a gift; but I seek fruit abounding to your credit.

18. But I have all things, and I abound: I am full, having received from Epaphroditus those things from you, an odor of a sweet savor, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

19. But my God will supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

20. To God even our Father be the glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.

21. Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me salute you.

22. All the saints, and especially those from the house of Caesar, salute you.

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
