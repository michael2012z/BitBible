## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. The same was in the beginning with God.

3. All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made, that has been made.

4. In Him was life, and the life was the light of the men.

5. And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.

6. There was a man having been sent from God, whose name was John;

7. The same came for a witness, that he might bear witness concerning the light, in order that all through him might believe.

8. He was not the light, but came that he might bear witness concerning the light.

9. That was the true light, which lighteth every man, coming into the world.

10. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.

11. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.

12. But so many as received Him, to them gave He the right to become the children of God, to those believing on His name:

13. who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14. The Word was made flesh, and tented among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten with the Father), full of grace and truth.

15. John beareth witness concerning Him, and cried out saying; This is He of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me has been before me:

16. because He was my Creator. And of His fullness we all received grace upon grace.

17. Because the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, the one being in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared him.

19. This is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, that they might ask him,

20. Who art thou? and he confessed and denied not, and confessed that, I am not the Christ.

21. They asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he says, I am not. Art thou that prophet?

22. And he responded, No. Then they said to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those having sent us. What do you say concerning yourself?

23. I am the voice of one roaring in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord as Isaiah the prophet said.

24. And those having been sent were of the Pharisees.

25. And they asked him, and said to him, Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that prophet?

26. John responded to them, saying, I baptize with water: There standeth One in your midst whom you do not know,

27. the One coming after me, of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the latchet of His sandal.

28. These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29. On the following day he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.

30. This is He concerning whom I spoke, A man cometh after me who has been before me: because he was my Creator.

31. And I did not know Him, but in order that He may be made manifest to Israel, on this account I came baptizing with water.

32. And John testified saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and remained on Him.

33. And I did not know Him, but the One having sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whom you may see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, He is the one baptizing with the Holy Ghost.

34. And I have seen, and testified that He is the Son of God.

35. On the following day John again stood, and two of his disciples,

36. and looking upon Jesus walking about, says, Behold, the Lamb of God.

37. And the two disciples heard him speaking and followed Jesus.

38. Jesus turning and seeing them following, says to them, What are you seeking? and they said to Him, Doctor, (which is said, being interpreted, Teacher), where dwellest thou?

39. He says to them; Come and see. Then they came and saw where He dwelleth, and they abode with Him that day: it was about the tenth hour.

40. Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two hearing from John, and follows Him;

41. he first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found Messiah, which is being interpreted, Christ.

42. He led him to Jesus. Jesus looking upon him said; Thou art Simon the Son of Jonah, thou shalt be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).

43. On the following day he wished to depart into Galilee, and he finds Philip. And Jesus says to him; Follow me.

44. Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip finds Nathanael and says to him, We have found Him, of whom Moses and the prophets, in the law, did write, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.

46. Nathanael said to him, Is any good thing able to come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and says concerning him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.

48. Nathanael says to Him, Whence do you know me? Jesus responded and said to him, Before Philip called you, I saw you, being under the fig-tree.

49. Nathanael responded, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel.

50. Jesus responded and said to him, Because I said to thee, that I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.

51. And He says to him, Truly, truly, I say unto you, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. 

## John 2

1. On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

2. and Jesus and His disciples were invited to the marriage.

3. And they had no wine, because the wine of the marriage was exhausted. Then the mother of Jesus says to Him, There is no wine.

4. And Jesus says to her, What is that to me and to thee? O woman, my hour is not yet come.

5. His mother says to the servants, Do whatsoever He may say to you.

6. And there were six waterpots of stone sitting there according to the purification of the Jews, containing about two or three firkins. Jesus says to them,

7. Fill the waterpots with water. They filled them to the brim.

8. And He says to them, Now draw out and carry to the chief ruler of the feast,

9. and they brought it to him. And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water, having been made wine, and did not know whence it is (but the servants having drawn the water knew), the ruler calls the groom,

10. and says to him, Every man first sets forth the good wine; and when they have drunk freely, the inferior: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

11. Jesus did this, the beginning of miracles, in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed on Him.

12. After this He and His mother, and His brothers and His disciples went down into Capernaum, and abode there not many days.

13. And the passover of the Jews were nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14. And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting:

15. and having made a scourge of cords, He cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the money of the exchangers, and over-turned the tables.

16. And He said to those selling doves; Take these things hence, make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.

17. And His disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house doth eat me up.

18. Then the Jews responded and said to Him, What sign do you show us, because you do these things?

19. Jesus responded and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will rear it up.

20. Then the Jews said, Forty and six years was this temple being built, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

21. But He spoke concerning the temple of His body.

22. Then when He arose from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said these things, and believed the Scripture and words which Jesus spoke.

23. And when He was in Jerusalem at the feast, during the passover, many believed on His name, seeing His miracles which He was doing;

24. and Jesus did not intrust Himself to them because He knows all men,

25. and because He had no need that any one should witness concerning man; because He was knowing what was in man. 

## John 3

1. There was a man of the Pharisees, the name to him Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;

2. the same came to Him by night, and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God; for no one is able to do these miracles, which thou art doing, unless God may he with him.

3. Jesus responded and said to him, Truly, truly, I say unto thee, unless any one may be born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus says to him; How is a man able to be born, being old? whether he is able to enter the second time into the womb of his mother, and be born?

5. Jesus responded, Truly, truly, I say unto thee, Unless any one may be born of water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

6. That which has been born of the flesh is flesh; and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.

7. Be not astonished because I said to thee; It behooveth you to be born from above.

8. The Spirit breathes on whom He willeth, and thou hearest His voice, but dost not know whence He cometh and whither He goeth; so is every one who has been born of the Spirit.

9. Nicodemus responded and said to Him, How are these things able to he?

10. Jesus responded and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not these things?

11. Truly, truly, I say unto thee, that we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and you received not our testimony.

12. If I spoke to you things upon the earth, and you do net believe, how will you believe, if I speak to you of things in heaven?

13. No one hath ascended up into heaven, but the one having come down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.

14. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so does it behoove the Son of man to be lifted up:

15. that every one believing in Him may have eternal life.

16. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one believing on Him may not perish but have eternal life.

17. For God sent not His Son into the world that He may condemn the world; but that the world through Him may be saved.

18. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not, has already been condemned, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light; for their works are evil.

20. For every one doing evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be convicted;

21. but every one doing the truth comes to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they have been wrought in God.

22. After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the Judean country; and there He was tarrying with them and baptizing.

23. And John was also baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there were many waters there: and they came and baptized.

24. For John was not yet cast into prison.

25. And there was a disputation of the disciples of John, concerning purifying.

26. And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, He who is with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all are coming to Him.

27. John responded and said, No man is able to receive anything, unless it may have been given unto him from heaven.

28. You are witnessing to me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him.

29. The one having the bride is the Bridegroom: but the friend of the Bridegroom is the one standing and hearing him, rejoiceth with joy on account of the Bridegroom: This, my joy has been made complete.

30. It behooveth Him to increase, and me to decrease.

31. He that cometh from above is above all;

32. the one being of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. The one coming from heaven witnesses what He has seen and heard, and no one receives His testimony.

33. The one having received His testimony hath set his seal, that God is true.

34. For whom God sent speaketh the words of God: for He does not give His spirit by measure.

35. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things in His hands.

36. He that believes on the Son has eternal life; but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. 

## John 4

1. Thus when the Lord knew when the Pharisees heard that Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John

2. (truly Jesus himself was not baptizing, but His disciples),

3. He left Judea and came again into Galilee.

4. And it behooved Him to go through Samaria.

5. Then He comes into a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the place which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. And the well of Jacob was there. Then Jesus having become weary from the journey, was sitting thus by the well: it was about the sixth hour.

7. A woman comes from Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.

8. For His disciples had gone into the city, that they might purchase food.

9. A Samaritan woman says to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask to drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?

10. And Jesus responded and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and the one who is speaking to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.

11. The woman says to Him, Sir, thou hast no windlass, and the well is deep: whence hast thou living water?

12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself and his sons, and his herds, drank of it?

13. Jesus responded and said to her, Every one drinking of this water shall thirst again:

14. but whosoever may drink of the water that I shall give to him shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give to him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.

15. Then the woman says to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.

16. He says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

17. The woman responded and said, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Well didst thou say, I have no husband:

18. for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: thou hast spoken this truly.

19. The woman says to Him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where it behooveth to worship.

21. Jesus says to her, Believe me, woman, that the hour cometh, you will worship the Father neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.

22. You worship, you know not what: we worship that which we know: because salvation is of the Jews.

23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such worshiping Him.

24. God is a Spirit, and it behooveth those who worship Him to worship in spirit and in truth.

25. The woman says to Him, I know that Messiah cometh (who is called Christ): when He may come, He will proclaim to us all things.

26. Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am He.

27. And at this time His disciples came, and were wondering because He was speaking with the woman; no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why do you speak with her?

28. Then the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and says to the men,

29. Come hither, see the man who told me all things which I did: Is not He the Christ?

30. They came out from the city, and came to Him.

31. Meanwhile His disciples were asking Him, saying, Master eat.

32. He said to them, I have meat to eat, which you know not.

33. Then His disciples were speaking to one another, Whether has any one brought Him something to eat?

34. Jesus says to them, My food is that I may do the will of Him that sent me, and finish His work.

35. Do you not say, That it is yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and see the fields, because they are white unto the harvest

36. already. He that reapeth receiveth reward, and gathereth fruit unto eternal life; in order that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.

37. For in this the word is true, that there is one sowing, and another reaping.

38. I have sent you to reap that upon which you have never labored: others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.

39. But many of the Samaritans from that city believed on Him through the word of the woman, testifying that, He told me all things which I did. Then when the Samaritans came to Him they asked Him to abide with them:

40. and He remained there two days:

41. and many more believed on Him through His word;

42. and they continued to say to the woman, We no longer believe through your talk; for we have heard and we know that He is truly the Savior of the world.

43. And after two days He departed thence into Galilee.

44. And Jesus Himself witnessed, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.

45. And when He came into Galilee, Galileans received Him, having seen all things which He did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also came to the feast.

46. Then He came again into Cana of Galilee, where He turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royalist, whose son was sick in Capernaum;

47. he having heard that Jesus has come out of Judea into Galilee, came away to Him, and continued to ask Him that He may come down and heal his son; for He was about to die.

48. Then Jesus said to him, Unless you may see signs and wonders, you can not believe.

49. The nobleman says to Him, Lord, come down before my little child dies.

50. Jesus says to him, Go; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus spoke to him, and departed.

51. And he already coming down, the servants met him, and reported, that the child lives.

52. Then he inquired the hour at which he began to improve; and they said to him, The fever left him at the seventh hour yesterday.

53. Then the father knew that it was at that hour at which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth: and he and all his house believed.

54. Jesus, having again come out of Judea into Galilee, wrought this second miracle. 

## John 5

1. After these things was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up into Jerusalem.

2. And there is a pool at the sheep-market, called in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches.

3. In them a multitude of the sick, blind, lame, withered, were lying down.

4. And a certain man was there, being thirty-eight years in his infirmity;

5. Jesus seeing him lying down, and knowing that he already has much time, says to him; Do you wish to be whole?

6. The sick man responded to Him, Lord, I have no man that may put me in the pool, when the water may be troubled: and while I come, another goes down before me.

7. And Jesus says to him, Arise, take thy bed, and walk about.

8. And the man was made whole, and he took up his bed and continued to walk about. And it was the Sabbath on that day.

9. Then the Jews were saying to the healed man, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

10. He responded to them, the one having made me whole, He said to me, Take thy bed, and walk about.

11. They asked him, Who is the man who said to thee, Take thy bed, and walk about?

12. And the sick man did not know who He is: for Jesus went out, the crowd being in the place.

13. And after these things, Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou hast been made whole: sin no more, lest something worse may come on thee.

14. And the man departed, and said to the Jews, that Jesus is the one having made him whole.

15. And on account of this the Jews continued to persecute Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.

16. And He responded to them, My Father worketh until now, and I work.

17. Therefore the Jews the more sought to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but said that God was His Father, making himself equal to God.

18. Then Jesus responded and said to them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, The Son is not able to do anything Himself, unless He may see the Father doing it: for whatsoever He may do, the Son likewise also doeth the same.

19. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things which He doeth; and will show Him greater things than these, in order that you may be astonished.

20. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and createth life in them, so the Son also createth life in whom He will.

21. For the Father judgeth no one, for He hath given all judgment to the Son;

22. in order that all may honor the Son, as they may honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father who sent Him.

23. Truly, truly, I say unto you, that every one hearing my word, and believing on Him that sent me hath eternal life, and doth not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.

24. Truly, truly, I say unto you, that the hour cometh and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and having heard will live.

25. For as the Father hath life in Himself, so also He has given to His Son to have life also in Himself.

26. And He hath given Him authority to execute the judgment, because He is the Son of man.

27. Do not be astonished at this: because the hour cometh, in which all who are in their graves will hear His voice,

28. and come forth; those having done good, unto the resurrection of life; and those having done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.

29. I am not able to do anything of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the One having sent me.

30. If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.

31. There is another who testifieth concerning me; and you know that the testimony which He testifies concerning me is true.

32. You sent to John, and he witnessed to the truth:

33. but I do not receive the witness with man: but I speak these things that you may be saved.

34. He was a bright and shining light: and you were willing to rejoice for an hour in that light.

35. But I have a testimony greater than that of John: for the works that the Father hath given me that I may perfect them, these works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.

36. And the Father having sent me, He hath testified concerning me: never have you heard His voice, neither have you seen His face:

37. and you have not His word abiding in you: because you do not believe Him whom He has sent.

38. Search the Scriptures, because in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify concerning me;

39. and you do not wish to come unto me, in order that you may have life.

40. I do not receive glory with men;

41. but I know you that you have not the love of God in you.

42. I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me: if another may come in his own name, you will receive him.

43. How are you able to believe, receiving glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is with God only?

44. Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one accusing you, in whom you have hoped.

45. For if you were believing Moses, you were believing me; for he wrote concerning me.

46. For if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words? 

## John 6

1. After these things Jesus went beyond the Sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.

2. And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw the miracles He was doing in behalf of the sick.

3. And Jesus came into the mountain; and was sitting there with His disciples.

4. And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was nigh.

5. Therefore Jesus lifting up His eyes, and seeing that a great multitude is coming to Him, He says to Philip, Whence can we purchase bread, that these may eat?

6. He spoke this testing him; for He knew what He was about to do.

7. Philip responded to Him, The loaves of two hundred denaria are not sufficient for these, that each one may receive a little.

8. And one of His disciples, Andrew, the brother of Peter, says to Him,

9. There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fishes: but what are these among so many?

10. And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. And there was much grass in the place. However the men sat down in number about five thousand.

11. And Jesus took the bread; and gave thanks, and gave it to the disciples, and the disciples to the people sitting down; and likewise also of the fishes so much as they wished.

12. And when they were filled, He says to His disciples, Gather up the remaining fragments, that nothing may be lost.

13. Then they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets from the live barley loaves, which remained to those having eaten.

14. Then the people, seeing the miracle which Jesus did, were saying, that, This is truly the prophet who is coming into the world.

15. And Jesus knowing that they are about to come and take Him, that they may make Him king, departs again into the mountain Himself alone.

16. And when it was evening, His disciples went down to the sea;

17. and embarking in the ship, they were going to the other side of the sea into Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them;

18. and the sea wrought, a great wind blowing.

19. Then having gone about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and being near the ship; and were terrified.

20. And He says to them, I am here; fear not.

21. Then they wished to receive Him into the ship, and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were going.

22. On the following day the multitude standing beyond the sea saw that there was no other ship there, except one, and that Jesus did not go along with His disciples into the ship, but His disciples went away alone

23. (other ships came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread, the Lord having given thanks).

24. And when the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they went into ships, and came into Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

25. And having found Him beyond the sea, they said to Him, Master, when did you come hither?

26. Jesus responded to them and said, Truly, truly, I say unto you, You seek me not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.

27. Labor not for the food that perishes, but the food that abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man gives to you: for this God the Father hath sealed.

28. Then they said to Him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?

29. Jesus responded and said to them, This is the work of God, that you may believe on Him whom He hath sent.

30. Then they said to Him, Then what miracle do you perform, that we may see, and believe you, what you may do?

31. Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness; as has been written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

32. Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.

33. For the bread of God is the One coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.

34. Then they said to Him, Lord, evermore give to us this bread.

35. Then Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; the one coming unto me can never hunger, and the one believing on me shall never thirst.

36. But I said unto you, That you have seen, and you do not believe.

37. Everything which the Father giveth unto me shall come to me; and him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.

38. Because I have come down from heaven, not that I may do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.

39. And this is the will of the One having sent me, that everything that the Father has given unto me I shall lose nothing of it, but I shall raise it up in the last day.

40. For this is the will of my Father, that every one seeing the Son, and believing on Him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up in the last day.

41. Then the Jews were murmuring concerning Him, because He said, I am the bread having come down from heaven,

42. and they continued to say, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how does He now say; I have come down from heaven?

43. Jesus responded and said to them, Murmur not with one another.

44. No one is able to come unto me, unless the Father who sent me may draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.

45. It is written in the prophets, They shall all be taught of God; every one hearing and learning from the Father, comes to me.

46. No one has seen the Father, except the One who is with God, He hath seen God.

47. Truly, truly, I say unto you, the one believing has eternal life.

48. I am the bread of life.

49. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died;

50. this is the bread coming down from heaven, that any one may eat of it, and not die.

51. I am the living bread, having come down from heaven; if any one may eat of me the bread, he will live forever: and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.

52. Then the Jews were contending with one another, saying, How is this One able to give unto us His flesh to eat?

53. Then Jesus said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Unless you may eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.

54. The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood has eternal life; and I will raise him up in the last day.

55. For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink.

56. The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood abides in me, and I in him.

57. As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father; truly the one eating me, shall also live through me.

58. He is the bread having come down from heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died: the one eating this bread shall live forever.

59. And He spoke these things in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.

60. Then many of His disciples, hearing, said, This is a hard sermon; who is able to hear it?

61. And Jesus knowing in Himself that His disciples are murmuring concerning it, said to them, Does this offend you?

62. If then you may see the Son of man ascending up, where He was formerly?

63. The Spirit is the One who creates life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life.

64. But there are certain ones of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning that there are certain ones not believing, and there is one going to betray Him.

65. And He said, Therefore I have said unto you, that no one is able to come unto me, unless it may have been given unto him of the Father.

66. Moreover from this many of His disciples went back, and walked with Him no more.

67. Then Jesus said to the twelve, Do you also wish to go away?

68. Simon Peter responded to Him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life;

69. we have believed and we know that thou art the Holy One of God.

70. Jesus responded to them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is devilish?

71. But He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon, for he was going to betray Him, being one of the twelve. 

## John 7

1. After these things Jesus walked about in Galilee: for He was not willing to walk about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.

2. And the feast of the Jews, tabernacles, was nigh.

3. Then His brothers said to Him; Depart hence, and go into Judea; in order that thy disciples shall see thy works which thou art doing. For no one does anything in secret, and Himself seeks to be public.

4. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.

5. For His brothers were not believing on Him.

6. Jesus says to them, My time is not yet; but your time is always ready.

7. The world is not able to hate you; but it hates me, because I testify against it, that its works are evil.

8. You go up to the feast: I do not go to this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.

9. Saying these things He remained in Galilee.

10. And when His brothers went up to the feast, then Himself also went up, not openly, but in secret.

11. Then the Jews were seeking Him at the feast, and saying, Where is He?

12. And there was much murmuring in the crowd concerning Him: some indeed were saying, That He is good; others were saying, No, but He deceives the multitude.

13. No one indeed was speaking openly concerning Him on account of the fear of the Jews.

14. But the feast already being midway, Jesus came up into the temple, and was teaching.

15. Then the Jews marveled, saying; How does this one know letters, never having been taught?

16. Then Jesus responded to them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but of Him that sent me;

17. if any one may will to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak for myself.

18. He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: he that seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.

19. Did not Moses give you the law? and no one of you does the law. Why do you seek to kill me?

20. And the multitude responded, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?

21. Jesus responded and said to them, I did one work, and you were all astonished.

22. Moses gave you circumcision, not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers, and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.

23. If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, in order that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you mad at me, because I made a man entirely whole on the Sabbath?

24. Judge not according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.

25. Then certain ones of Jerusalemites were saying, Is not this He whom they wished to kill?

26. And behold He speaks publicly, and they say nothing to Him. Whether do the rulers truly know that He is the Christ?

27. But we know Him whence He is: but when Christ may come, no one knows whence He is.

28. Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You indeed know me, and know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but the one sending me is true, whom you do not know.

29. I know Him, because I am with Him, and He sent me.

30. Then they were seeking to arrest Him: and no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.

31. And many from the multitude believed on Him; and continued to say, When Christ may come, will He do more miracles than this one is doing?

32. The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers, that they should arrest Him.

33. Then Jesus said, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to Him that sent me.

34. You will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, you are not able to come.

35. Then the Jews said to themselves, Where is He about to go, that we shall not find Him? is He about to go into the Dispersion of the Greek, and teach the Greeks?

36. What is this word which He said, You shall seek me, and not find me: and where I am, you are not able to come?

37. And on the last great day of the feast, Jesus stood and continued to cry out, saying, If any one thirst, let him come and drink.

38. The one believing on me, as the Scripture said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.

39. And He spoke this concerning the Spirit, whom those believing on Him were about to receive: for the Spirit was not yet; because Jesus was not yet glorified.

40. Then those hearing these words from the multitude, were saying, This is truly the prophet;

41. others were saying, He is the Christ; others were saying, For whether does Christ come out of Galilee?

42. Did not the Scripture say, that Christ comes from the seed of David and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was?

43. Then there was a schism in the crowd on account of Him:

44. and some of them wished to arrest Him; but no one laid hands on Him.

45. Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why did you not bring Him?

46. The officers responded, Never did a man so speak, as this man speaks.

47. And the Pharisees responded to them; Are ye also deceived?

48. Whether has any one of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on Him?

49. But this crowd knowing not the law are accursed.

50. Nicodemus being one of them, says to them;

51. Whether does our law judge a man, until it may first hear from him and know what he does?

52. They responded and said to him, Whither art thou also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet rises out of Galilee. 

## John 8

1. Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world: the one following me can not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of the life.

2. Then the Pharisees said to Him, Thou art testifying concerning thyself; Thy testimony is not true. And Jesus responded and said to them,

3. If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go. You know not whence I come, or whither I go.

4. You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.

5. If I judge, my judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and the One having sent me.

6. And it has been written in our law, that the testimony of two men is true.

7. I am the one testifying concerning myself, and the Father having sent me, testifies concerning me.

8. Then they said to Him, Where is thy Father? Jesus responded; You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would also know my Father.

9. He spoke these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one arrested Him; because His hour had not yet come.

10. Then He again said to them, I go away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin: whither I go you are not able to come.

11. Then the Jews were saying, Whether will He kill Himself, because He says, Whither I go away, you are not able to come?

12. And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.

13. Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you may not believe that I am He, you shall die in your sins.

14. Then they said to Him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, Even that which I also speak to you from the beginning.

15. I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you; but the One having sent me is true; those things which I heard with Him, these I speak to the world.

16. They did not know that He spoke to them concerning the Father.

17. Then Jesus said, When you may lift up the Son of man, then you shall know that I am He, and I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me, I speak the same things.

18. Truly the One having sent me is with me; He has not left me alone; because I always do those things which are pleasing to Him.

19. He speaking these things, many believed on Him.

20. Then Jesus said to the Jews, who believed on Him, If you may abide in my word, you are truly my disciples;

21. and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

22. They responded to Him, we are the seed of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one: How do You say, that you shall be free?

23. Jesus responded to them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, That every one doing sin is the slave of sin.

24. But the slave abides not in the house forever; the Son abides forever.

25. If therefore the Son may make you free, you shall be free indeed.

26. I know ye are the seed of Abraham; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.

27. Whatsoever I have seen with the Father I speak: you therefore are doing the things which you heard with your father.

28. They responded and said to Him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.

29. But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard with God: Abraham did not this.

30. You are doing the works of your father. They said to Him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.

31. Jesus said to them; If God were your Father, you would love me: for I came out from God, and I return; for I have not spoken from myself, but He sent me.

32. Wherefore do you not understand my speech? Because you are not able to hear my word.

33. You are of your father the devil, and you wish to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there was no truth in him. When he may speak a lie, he speaks of his own: because he is a liar, and the father of the same.

34. And because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.

35. Which one of you convicts me concerning sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?

36. The one being of God hears the words of God: on account of this you do not hear, because you are not of God.

37. The Jews responded and said to Him, Do we not truly say that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?

38. Jesus responded, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.

39. But I do not seek my own glory: there is One seeking and judging.

40. Truly, truly, I say unto you, if any one may keep my word, he may never see death.

41. The Jews said to Him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham and the prophets are dead; and thou sayest, If any one may keep my word, he may never taste death.

42. Whether art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom do you make yourself?

43. Jesus responded, If I may glorify myself, my glory is nothing: my Father is the one glorifying me; whom you say, that, He is our God;

44. indeed you do not know Him: but I know Him. If I may say, I know Him not, I will be a liar like you: but I know Him, and I keep His word.

45. Abraham, our father, rejoiced that he might see my day; he saw it, and was glad.

46. Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?

47. Jesus said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

48. Then they took up stones that they might cast at Him: and Jesus was hidden, and departed out from the temple. 

## John 9

1. And passing along, He saw a man blind from his birth.

2. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned, this one, or his parents, that he was born blind?

3. Jesus responded, Neither did he nor his parents sin; but that the works of God may be made manifest in him.

4. It behooveth us to work the works of Him that sent us, while it is day: the night comes, when no one is able to work.

5. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

6. Saying these words, He spat on the ground, and made mortar out of the spittle, and besmeared the mortar on his eyes,

7. and He said to him; Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent). Then he went away, and washed, and came seeing.

8. Then the neighbors, and those seeing him previously, because he was a beggar, continued to say, Is not this the one sitting and begging?

9. Some said, That he is: others said, No, but he is like him: he said, I am he.

10. Then they said to him, How then were your eyes opened?

11. He responded, a man called Jesus made mortar and besmeared my eyes, and said, Go to Siloam, and wash. Then having gone away and washed, I looked up.

12. They said to him, Where is He? He says, I know not.

13. They lead him to the Pharisees, him formerly blind.

14. And it was the Sabbath on the day on which Jesus made mortar, and opened his eyes.

15. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he looked up. And he said to them, He placed the mortar on my eyes, and I washed, and see.

16. Then certain ones of the Pharisees said, This man is not with God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is a wicked man able to do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

17. Then they again say to the blind man, What do you say concerning Him, because He opened your eyes? And he said that, He is a prophet.

18. Then the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind, and looked up, until they called the parents of him that looked up,

19. and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?

20. Then his parents responded and said; We know that he is our son, and that he was born blind:

21. but how he now sees, we know not; nor who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he has majority; he will speak for himself.

22. And his parents said these things, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already stipulated, that if any one should confess Him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

23. Therefore his parents said that, He has majority, ask him.

24. Then they asked the man the second time who was blind, and said to him, Give God the glory: we know that this man is a sinner.

25. Then he responded, If He is a sinner, I know not: one thing I do know, that being blind I now see.

26. Then they said to him, What did He to you? how did He open your eyes?

27. He responded to them, I told you already, and you did not hearken: why do you wish to hear again? whether do you wish to become His disciples?

28. They railed on him, and said, You are His disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses:

29. we know that God spoke to Moses: but we do not know this One, whence He is.

30. The man responded and said to them; For in this it is wonderful, that you do not know whence He is, He truly opened my eyes.

31. We know that God hears not sinners: but if any one may be a worshiper of God, and do His will, He hears him.

32. It was never heard of from the beginning that any one opened the eyes of a man who was born blind:

33. if He were not with God, He would not be able to do anything.

34. They responded and said to him, Thou art altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

35. Jesus heard that they cast him out; and having found him, said, Do you believe on the Son of man?

36. He responded and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe on, Him?

37. Jesus said to him, Indeed you have seen Him, and the One speaking with you is He.

38. And He said, I believe, Lord: and he worshiped Him.

39. And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those not seeing may see; and those seeing may be made blind.

40. And those of the Pharisees being with Him heard, and said to Him, Whether are we also blind?

41. Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would not have sin: but now you say that, We see: your sin remaineth. 

## John 10

1. Truly, truly, I say unto you, the one coming not in through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbing up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.

2. And the one coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear His voice: and he calls His own sheep by name, and leads them out.

4. When He may put out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow Him: because they know his voice:

5. but they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him: because they know not the voice of strangers.

6. He spoke this parable to them: but they did not know what things He was speaking to them.

7. Then Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say unto you, that I am the door of the sheep.

8. All so many as came were thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

9. I am the door: if any one may enter in through me, he shall be saved; he shall go in and come out, and find pasture.

10. The thief does not come, but that he may steal, and slay, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and have it more abundantly.

11. I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.

12. The hireling, and the one not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees away, and the wolf seizes and scatters them:

13. because he is a hireling and there is not a care to him for the sheep.

14. I am the Good Shepherd; I know mine, and mine know me,

15. as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father; and I lay down My soul for the sheep.

16. And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: and it behooves me to bring them and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

17. Therefore my Father loves Me, because I lay down my soul, that I may take it again.

18. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and power to receive it again. I received this commandment from my Father.

19. Again there was a schism among the Jews on account of these words.

20. Then many of them were saying, He has a demon, and is gone mad; why do you hear Him? Others were saying,

21. These are not the words of a demonized man. Whether is a demon able to open the eyes of the blind?

22. And it was the feast of dedication in Jerusalem: and it was winter;

23. and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.

24. Then the Jews surrounded Him, and said to Him, How long do you take away our soul?

25. If thou art the Christ, tell us openly. Jesus responded, I told you, and you do not believe: the works which I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me.

26. But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.

27. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

28. and I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand.

29. The Father, who has given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them out of the hand of the Father.

30. I and the Father are one.

31. Again the Jews took up stones, that they might stone Him.

32. Jesus responded to them, I have shown unto you many beautiful works from the Father; on account of which of these do you stone me?

33. The Jews responded to Him, We do not stone Thee for good work, but for blasphemy; because Thou, being a man, art making Thyself God.

34. And Jesus responded to them, Is it not written in your law, that I said, Ye are gods?

35. If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture is not able to be broken),

36. whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, do you say; Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?

37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

38. If I do, believe not me, believe the works: that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.

39. They sought again to take Him: and He passed out of their hand.

40. And again He departed beyond the Jordan into the place where John was first baptizing; and remained there:

41. and many came to Hint, and said, that John indeed did no miracle; but all things so many as John spoke concerning this One are true.

42. And many believed on Him there. 

## John 11

1. And a certain one was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.

2. And Mary was the one anointing the Lord with myrrh, and wiping His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3. Then the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold the one whom thou lovest is sick.

4. And Jesus hearing said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.

5. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus, with Divine love.

6. Therefore when He heard that he was sick, He then remained two days in the place in which He was.

7. Then after this He says to the disciples, Let us go again unto Judea.

8. The disciples said to Him, Master, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; dost thou go hither again?

9. Jesus responded, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any one may walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world:

10. if any one may walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.

11. He spoke these things: and after this He says to them, Our friend Lazarus is asleep; and I go that I may awaken him.

12. Then the disciples said to Him, Lord, if he is asleep, he will be saved.

13. But Jesus spoke concerning his death: and they thought that He spoke concerning the rest of sleep.

14. Then however Jesus spoke to them openly, Lazarus is dead,

15. and I rejoice on account of you that I was not there, in order that you may believe; but let us go to him.

16. Then Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples; Let us go too, that we may die with Him.

17. Then Jesus having come, found him having four days in the sepulcher.

18. But Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs.

19. And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother.

20. Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus comes, went to meet Him: and Mary sat in the house.

21. Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

22. And now I know that, whatsoever things you may ask of God, God will give to you.

23. Jesus says to her, Thy brother will rise again.

24. Martha says to Him, I know he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.

25. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life; the one believing on me, though he may die, shall live: and

26. every one living and believing on me can never die: do you believe this?

27. She says to Him, Yes, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, come into the world.

28. And having said this, she departed, and called her sister Mary, speaking secretly, The Teacher is present, and calls you.

29. She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to Him:

30. Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was yet in the place where Martha met Him.

31. Then the Jews being with her in the house, and comforting her, seeing Mary, that she arose up quickly and went out, followed her, thinking that she goes to the tomb in order that she may weep there.

32. Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing Him, fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

33. Then when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews, having come with her, weeping, He groaned in spirit, and troubled Himself,

34. and said, Where have you laid him? They say to Him, Lord, come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. Then the Jews were saying, Behold, how He loved him as a friend!

37. And some of them said, Was not this One, having opened the eyes of the blind, able to bring it to pass, that he indeed should not die?

38. Then Jesus again groaning in Himself comes to the tomb; and it was a cave, and a stone was laid upon it.

39. Jesus says; Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to Him; Lord, already he smelleth: for he is dead four days.

40. Jesus says to her; Did I not tell thee, that, if thou canst believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?

41. Then they took away the stone; and Jesus lifted up His eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee, because Thou hast heard Me.

42. I know that Thou dost always hear Me; but on account of the multitude standing around I spoke, in order that they might believe that Thou didst send Me.

43. And speaking these things, He cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come forth.

44. And the dead came out, bound as to his feet and hands with graveclothes; and his face bound round with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him go.

45. Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary and seeing the things which He did, believed on Him:

46. but certain ones of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus did.

47. Then the chief priests and Pharisees assembled the Sanhedrin, and continued to say, What are we doing? because this man is doing many miracles.

48. If we thus let Him alone, all will believe on Him: and the Romans will come and take away our place and nation.

49. But one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them,

50. You know nothing, you do not consider that it is profitable to you, that one man may die for the people, and the whole nation perish not.

51. And he spoke this not of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation.

52. And not only for the nation, but that He may gather into one the children of God dispersed abroad.

53. Then from that day they passed the verdict, that they would kill Him.

54. Therefore Jesus walked no more publicly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, into a city called Ephraim; and there tarried with His disciples.

55. And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many came up out of the country into Jerusalem before the passover, in order that they might purify themselves.

56. Then they were seeking Jesus, and standing in the temple, they were saying one with another, What seems to you; that He may not come to the feast?

57. And both the high priests and Pharisees had given commandment, if any one should know where He is, he should communicate it, in order that they might arrest Him. 

## John 12

1. Then Jesus, six days before the passover came into Bethany, where Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead, was,

2. Then they made a supper for Him there: and Martha was serving; and Lazarus was one of those sitting at the table with Him.

3. Then Mary taking a pound of myrrh of spikenard, estimated very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the myrrh.

4. Then Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, the one about to betray Him, says:

5. Why was not this myrrh sold for three hundred denaria, and given to the poor?

6. And He spoke this, not because there was a care to him for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and was carrying those things cast in.

7. Then Jesus said, Let her alone; she hath reserved this unto the day of my burial;

8. for you have the poor always with you; but you have not me always.

9. then a great multitude of the Jews came not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead; because he was there.

10. But the chief priest passed an edict that they would also slay Lazarus;

11. because through him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.

12. On the following day a great multitude having come to the feast, hearing that Jesus comes into Jerusalem,

13. They took the branches of the palm-trees, and went out to meet Him, and continued to cry out, Hosanna: blessed is He that cometh, in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.

14. And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat upon him, as has been written,

15. Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting upon the colt of a donkey.

16. But His disciples at first did not understand these things: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written in reference to Him, and they did them to Him.

17. Then the multitude being with Him witnessed that He called Lazarus out of the sepulcher, and raised him from the dead.

18. Therefore the multitude also went to meet Him, because they heard that He had wrought this miracle.

19. Then the Pharisees said to one another, You see, that you are prevailing as to nothing: behold, the world has gone away after Him.

20. And there was certain Greeks of those having come up that they might worship at the feast:

21. then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and requested him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.

22. Philip comes and tells Andrew: Andrew and Philip go, and speak to Jesus.

23. And Jesus responds to them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man may be glorified.

24. Truly, truly, I say unto you, Unless the grain of wheat having fallen into the ground may die, it remains alone; but if it may die, it produces much fruit.

25. The one loving his soul shall lose it; but the one that hateth his soul in this world will preserve it unto eternal life.

26. If any one may minister unto me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my minister be: if any one may minister unto me, the Father will honor him.

27. Now my soul is troubled; and what do I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on this account I came to this hour.

28. Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have indeed glorified thee, and will glorify thee again.

29. Then the multitudes standing, hearing, said, That it was thunder; others said, An angel has spoken to Him.

30. Jesus responded and said, This voice was not on account of me, but on account of you.

31. Now is the judgment of this world: now the prince of this world shall be cast out.

32. And if I may be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men towards me.

33. And He spoke this, signifying by what death He was about to die.

34. Then the multitude responded to Him; We have heard from the law that Christ abideth forever; and how do You say, That it behooveth the Son of man to be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

35. Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk about as you have the light, in order that the darkness may not overtake you: and he that walketh about in darkness does not know where he is going.

36. While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may be the sons of light. And Jesus spoke these things, and having gone out was hidden from them.

37. And He having done so many miracles in their presence, they were not believing on Him,

38. in order that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

39. Wherefore were they not able to believe, because Isaiah again said,

40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; in order that they may not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and turn, and I shall heal them.

41. Isaiah said these things, because he saw His glory; and spoke concerning Him.

42. Nevertheless indeed many of the rulers also believed on Him; but they were not confessing Him on account of the Pharisees, in order that they might not be put out of the synagogues:

43. for they loved the glory of the people more than the glory of God.

44. But Jesus cried out and said; The one believing on me, believes not on me, but on Him that sent me,

45. and the one seeing me, sees the one that sent me.

46. I have come a light into the world, in order that every one believing on me may not abide in darkness.

47. And if any one may hear my words, and not keep them, I do not judge him: for I came not that I may judge the world, but that I may save the world.

48. He that rejects me, and receiving not my words, has one judging him: the word which I have spoken, it will judge him in the last day.

49. Because I have not spoken of Myself; but the Father Himself having sent me, gave me commandment, what I shall speak, and what I shall say.

50. And I know that His commandment is eternal life. Now whatsoever thing I say, as the Father has spoken unto me, so I say. 

## John 13

1. And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that the hour has come when He must depart out of this world to His Father, having loved His own who were in the world, with divine love, He loved them perfectly.

2. And the supper being on hand, the devil already having entered into the heart, that Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, should betray Him,

3. knowing that the Father has given all things into His hands, and He came out from God, and is going away to God,

4. He rises from the supper, and lays aside His garments, and taking a towel, girded Himself;

5. then He pours water into a bowl, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.

6. Then He comes to Simon Peter; he says to Him; Lord, do you wash my feet?

7. Jesus responded and said to him, What I do you know not now; but shall understand hereafter.

8. Peter says to Him, You may never wash my feet. Jesus responded to him, If I wash thee not, thou hast not part with me.

9. And Simon Peter says to Him, Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head.

10. Jesus says to Him, He that is bathed hath no need to wash his hands, but is altogether clean: and you are clean, but not all.

11. For He knew the one betraying Him. On this account He said, You are not all clean.

12. Then when He washed their feet, and took His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, Do you understand what I have done to you?

13. You call me Master and Lord, and you speak beautifully; for I am.

14. If then I, your Lord and Master, washed your feet, you ought also to wash the feet of one another.

15. For I have given unto you an example, that you may also do as I have done to you.

16. Truly, truly, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; nor the apostle greater than him that sent him.

17. If you know these things, happy are ye if you may do them.

18. I do not speak concerning you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.

19. Now I tell you before it takes place, in order that you may believe, when it may be done, that I am He.

20. Truly, truly, I say unto you, The one receiving the one whom I may send, receiveth me; and the one receiving me, receives Him that sent me.

21. Jesus saying these things, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said; Truly, truly, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

22. Then the disciples began to look to one another, being at a loss concerning which one He speaks.

23. And one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning on the bosom of Jesus.

24. Then Simon Peter beckons to him, to ask who he might be concerning whom He speaks.

25. And that one, falling toward the bosom of Jesus says to Him, Lord, who is he?

26. And Jesus responds, He is that one to whom, having dipped the morsel, I will give it. And having dipped the morsel, He takes it, and gives it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

27. And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus says to him; What thou art doing, do more quickly.

28. And no one of those sitting with Him knew what He said to him:

29. for some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus says to him, Purchase some of those things of which we have need at the supper; or something that he might give to the poor.

30. Then he having taken the morsel, went out immediately: and it was night.

31. Then when he went out, Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.

32. And if God is glorified in Him, God will indeed glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.

33. Children, I am still with you. You shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, you are not able to come; and now I say to you.

34. I give unto a new commandment, That you must love one another with divine love; as I have loved you with divine love, that you must also love one another with divine love:

35. in this shall all know that you are my disciples, if you may have divine love one with another.

36. Simon Peter says to Him; Lord, whither do you go? Jesus responded, Whither I go you are not able to follow me now; but shall follow me hereafter.

37. Peter says to Him; Lord, why am I not able to follow thee now? I will lay down my soul for thee.

38. Jesus responds to him, Wilt thou lay down thy soul for me? Truly, truly, I say unto thee, that the cock shall not crow, until thou shalt thrice deny me. 

## John 14

1. Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

2. Many mansions are in the house of my Father; but if it were not so, I would have told you; because I go to prepare a place for you.

3. And if I may go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; in order that you may also be where I am.

4. And whither I go, you know the way.

5. And Thomas says to Him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest: and how do we know the way?

6. Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh to the Father, but through me.

7. If you have known me, you shall also know my Father: and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.

8. Philip says to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

9. Jesus says to Him, Am I so long time with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? The one having seen me hath seen the Father: how do you say, Show us the Father?

10. Dost thou not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words which I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father who abideth in me doeth His own works.

11. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or if not, believe for the sake of the works themselves.

12. Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, shall also do the works which I am doing; and shall do greater works than these: because I go to the Father:

13. and whatsoever you may ask in my name, I will do it, in order that the rather may be glorified in the Son.

14. If you may ask anything of me in my name, I will do it.

15. If you love me, keep my commandments.

16. And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you always,

17. the Spirit of truth: which the world is not able to receive, because it does not see Him, nor know Him: you know Him: because He abideth with you, and shall be in you.

18. I will not leave you orphans: I am coming to you.

19. Vet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.

20. In that day you shall know that I am in the Father, you in me, and I in you.

21. The one having my commandments, and keeping them, he is the one loving me with divine love: the one loving me with divine love, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself unto him.

22. Judas. (not Iscariot), says to Him, Lord, and how is it that you are about to manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?

23. Jesus responded and said to him; If any one may love me with divine love, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our mansion with him.

24. The one not loving me with divine love does not keep my words: and the word which you hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me.

25. I have spoken these things to you, abiding with you:

26. but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things, which I spoke to you.

27. My peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor afraid.

28. You heard that I said to you, I go away, and I come to you. If you love me with divine love, you would rejoice, because I go to my Father: because the Father is greater than I.

29. And I have now told you before it takes place, in order that, when it may come to pass, you may believe.

30. I shall no longer speak many things with you, because the prince of the world comes: and he has nothing in me;

31. but in order that the world may know that I love the Father, and as He commanded, so I am doing. Arise, let us go hence. 

## John 15

1. I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

2. Every branch in me not producing fruit, He takes it away: and every one producing fruit, He purifies it, that it may produce more fruit.

3. So ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

4. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch is not able to produce fruit of itself, unless it may abide in the vine; so you are not able, unless you may abide in me.

5. I am the vine, and ye are the branches. The one abiding in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit: because you are not able to do anything without me.

6. If any one may not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch, and withered; and they gather it, and cast it into the fire, and it is burnt.

7. If you may abide in me, and my words may abide in you, ask whatsoever you may wish, and it shall be done unto you.

8. In this my Father is glorified, that you may bear much fruit; and ye shall be my disciples.

9. As the Father loved me, I also loved you: abide in my love.

10. If you may keep my commandments, abide in my love; as I have kept the commandments of my Father, and I abide in His love.

11. I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.

12. This is my commandment, that you may love one another, as I loved you.

13. No one has greater love than this, that he may lay down his soul for his friends.

14. You are my friends, if you may do those things which I command you.

15. No longer do I call you servants; because the servant knows not what his lord is doing: but I have called you friends; because all things which I heard with my Father, I made known unto you.

16. You did not choose me, but I chose you, and placed you in your position, that you may go forth and bear fruit, and your fruit may abide: in order that He may give you whatsoever you may ask in my name.

17. I command these things unto you, that you must love one another with divine love.

18. If the world hates you, know that it first hated me.

19. If you were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.

20. Remember the word which I spoke to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.

21. But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know Him that sent me.

22. If I did not come and speak to them, they had not sin: now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. The one hating me hates my Father also.

24. If I did not works among them which no other did: they had not sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.

25. But in order that the word having been written in their law may be fulfilled, That they hated me gratuitously.

26. When the Comforter, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, may come, He will witness concerning me,

27. but you indeed are witnesses, because you are with me from the beginning. 

## John 16

1. I have spoken these things to you, that you may not be offended.

2. They will put you out of the synagogues: but the hour is coming, that every one killing you may think he is offering service to God.

3. And they will do these things, because they did not know the Father, nor me.

4. But I have spoken these things to you, that when the hour may come, you may remember them, that I did say them to you. But I said not these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you.

5. But now I go to Him that sent me; and no one of you asks me, Whither goest thou?

6. But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.

7. But now I tell you the truth; it is profitable to you that I may go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I may go, I will send Him to you.

8. And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.

9. Concerning sin indeed, because they do not believe on me; and concerning righteousness;

10. because I go to the Father, and you see me no more;

11. and concerning judgment, because the prince of this world has been condemned.

12. I have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.

13. But when He, the Spirit of truth, may come, He will guide you in all truth: for He will not speak from Himself; but so many things as He hears, He will speak: and will proclaim to you the things which are coming.

14. He will glorify me: because He will receive from mine, and proclaim them unto you.

15. And all things whatsoever the Father has are mine: therefore I said, that He takes from mine, and will proclaim them to you.

16. A little while, and ye see me no more; again a little while, and ye shall see me.

17. Then some of His disciples were saying to one another, What is this which He speaks to us, A little while, and you see me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me? and that I go to the Father?

18. Then they were speaking, What is this, Little while, of which He speaks? and we know not what He is talking about.

19. Jesus knew that they wished to ask Him, and said to them, You are seeking with one another concerning this, because I said, A little while, and you see me no more, and again a little while, and you shall see me?

20. Truly, truly, I say unto you, that you will weep and mourn, and the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.

21. When a woman may bring forth she has sorrow, because her hour has come: but when the little child may be born, she remembers her suffering no more, for the joy that a man has been born into the world.

22. Therefore you indeed also now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one taketh your joy from you.

23. And in that day you will ask of me nothing. Truly, truly, I say unto you, Whatsoever you may ask the Father, He will give it to you in my name.

24. Until now you have asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, in order that your joy may be full.

25. I have spoken these things unto you in parables; the hour comes, when I shall no longer speak to you in parables, but openly will I proclaim to you concerning the Father.

26. In that clay you shall ask in my name: and I do not say, that I will ask the Father for you;

27. for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved me as a friend, and you have believed that I came out from God.

28. I came out from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

29. His disciples say; Behold, now you are talking openly, and speaking no parable.

30. Now we know that you know all things, and have no need that any one may ask you: in this we believe that you came out from God.

31. Jesus responded to them, Do you now believe?

32. Behold, the hour cometh, and is already come, that you must be scattered abroad, each one to his own place, and leave me alone: I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

33. I have spoken these things to you, in order that you may have peace in me. In the world you have tribulation: but take courage; I have conquered the world. 

## John 17

1. Jesus spoke these words; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, said, Father, the hour has come; glorify thy Son, in order that the Son may glorify thee:

2. as thou didst give Him authority over all flesh, in order that whatsoever thou hast given unto Him, He may give unto them eternal life.

3. But this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send.

4. I glorified thee upon the earth, having finished the work that thou hast given to me that I may do it.

5. And now, Father, glorify thou me with thyself with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

6. I have manifested thy name, to the men whom thou didst give me out of the world. They were thine, and thou didst give them to me; and they have kept thy word:

7. now they know that all things so many as thou hast given to me are with thee:

8. because the words which thou didst give me I have given unto them; and they received them, and they know truly that I came out from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.

9. I pray for these: I pray not for the world; but for those whom thou hast given me, because they are thine:

10. and all mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I have been glorified in them.

11. And I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them through my name whom thou hast given unto me, in order that they may be one, as we are.

12. When I was with them, I was keeping them in thy name whom thou hast given unto me. And I guarded them, and no one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the Scripture may be fulfilled.

13. And now I come to thee; and speak these things in the world, that they may have my joy complete in themselves.

14. I have given unto them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.

15. I do not pray that you may take them out of the world, but that you may keep them from the evil one.

16. They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.

17. Sanctify them through the truth: thy word is truth.

18. As thou didst send me into the world, I also sent them into the world:

19. and I sanctify myself in their behalf, in order that they may also be sanctified through the truth.

20. And I not only pray for these, but also for those believing on me through their word;

21. that they may all be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us; that the world may believe that thou didst send me.

22. And I have given unto them the glory which thou hast given unto me; in order that they may be one, as we are one;

23. I in them, and thou in me, in order that they may be perfected into one; in order that the world may know that thou didst send me, and didst love them, as thou didst love me.

24. Father, that which thou hast given unto me, I wish that they may also be with me, where I am, in order that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given unto me: because thou didst love me before the foundation of the world.

25. Righteous Father, indeed the world does not know thee, but I know thee, and they know that thou didst send me;

26. I made known thy name to them, and will make it known; in order that the love with which thou didst love me may be in them, and I in them. 

## John 18

1. Jesus saying these things, went out with His disciples beyond the brook of Kidron, where there was a garden, into which He and His disciples came.

2. And Judas, the one having betrayed Him; knew the place: because frequently Jesus with His disciples resorted thither.

3. Then Judas, having taken a band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and arms.

4. Then Jesus, knowing all things which are coming on Him, came out, says to them, Whom do you seek?

5. They responded to Him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them, I am He. And Judas also, the one having betrayed Him, stood with them.

6. Then when He said to them, I am He, they went back, and fell on the ground.

7. Then He again asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.

8. Jesus responded, I told you that I am He: if then you seek me, let these depart.

9. In order that the word which He spoke might be fulfilled, that, I have lost none of those whom thou hast given unto me.

10. Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name to that servant was Malchus.

11. Then Jesus said to Peter, Put thy sword in the scabbard: the cup which the Father gave me, shall I not drink it?

12. Then the band and chiliarch, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound Him.

13. And they led Him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

14. And Caiaphas was the one counseling the Jews, that it is profitable that one man die for the people.

15. And Simon Peter and the other disciples followed Jesus. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and came with Jesus into the court of the high priest.

16. And Peter stood without at the door. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came out and spoke to the porter, and led in Peter.

17. And then the maidservant porter says to Peter, Art thou not one of the disciples of this man? He says, I am not.

18. And the servants and officers, having made a fire; because it was cold; were standing by it, and warming. And Peter was standing with them, and warming.

19. Then the high priest asked Jesus concerning His disciples and concerning His teaching.

20. And Jesus said to him, I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.

21. Why do you ask me? ask those who have heard, what I said to them: behold, they know what I said.

22. And He speaking these things, one of the officers standing by gave Jesus a slap, saying, Do you thus answer the high priest?

23. Jesus responded to him, If I spoke wickedly, witness concerning the wickedness: but if beautifully, why do you smite me?

24. Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

25. And Simon Peter was standing and warming: and they said to him, Art thou not one of His disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.

26. And one of the servants of the chief priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did I not see thee in the garden with Him?

27. Then Peter again denied, and immediately the cock crew.

28. Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas to the judgment hall: and it was morning. And they did not come into the judgment hall, in order that they might not be polluted, but that they might eat the passover.

29. Then Pilate came out to them, and says, What accusation do you bring against this man?

30. They responded and said to him, If He were not an evil doer, we would not deliver Him to you.

31. Then Pilate said to them. You take Him, and judge Him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any one.

32. In order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying by what death He was about to die.

33. Then Pilate came again into the judgment hall, and asked Jesus, and said to Him, Art thou the King of the Jews?

34. Jesus responded, Do you speak this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?

35. Pilate responded, Whether am I a Jew? thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?

36. Jesus responded, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight for me, in order that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from thence.

37. Then Pilate said to Him, Then, art thou not a king? Jesus responded, Thou says that I am king. Unto this I was born, and unto this I have come into the world, in order that I may bear witness to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.

38. Pilate says to Him, What is truth? And saying this, again he went out to the Jews, and speaks to them, I find no crime in Him.

39. There is a custom to you, that I release unto you one during the passover. Then do you wish that I may release unto you the King of the Jews?

40. Then they all again cried out, saying, Not Him, but Barabbas. And Barabbas was a robber. 

## John 19

1. Then Pilate took Jesus, and scourged Him.

2. And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, placed it on His head, and put on Him a purple robe;

3. and came to Him and continued to say, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave Him slaps.

4. Again Pilate went out, and speaks to them, Behold, I lead Him out to you, in order that you may know that I find no fault.

5. Then Jesus came out, bearing the thorny crown and purple robe. And he says to them, Behold, the man!

6. Then when the high priest and officers saw Him, they cried out, Crucify Him, crucify Him. Pilate says to them, You take Him, and crucify Him: for I find nothing criminal in Him.

7. And the Jews responded, We have a law, and according to law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.

8. Then when Pilate heard this word, he feared the more;

9. then he went again into the judgment hall, and speaks to Jesus, Whence art thou? And Jesus gave him no answer.

10. Pilate says to Him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and I have power to crucify you?

11. Jesus responded, Thou hast no power against me, unless it was given to thee from above: on this account the one having betrayed me to thee has the greater sin.

12. After this Pilate still sought to release Him: but the Jews continued to cry out, saying, If you release Him, you are not the friend of Caesar: every one making himself king speaks against Caesar.

13. Then Pilate hearing these words, led out Jesus, and sat down on the tribunal, in the place called Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. And it was the preparation of the passover: and was about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Behold, your King!

15. Then they cried out, Take Him away, take Him away, crucify Him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? And the chief priests responded, We have no king but Caesar.

16. Therefore he then delivered Him to them that He should be crucified. Then they took Jesus and led Him away.

17. And He was bearing His cross. And He went out into a place called Calvary, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.

18. They crucified Him there, and two others with Him, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.

19. And Pilate also wrote His title, and placed it upon the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. Then many of the Jews read this title: because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Roman.

21. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, King of the Jews; but that He said, I am the King of the Jews.

22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

23. Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took His garments, and made them four parts, a part for each soldier; and the vesture. And the vesture was seamless, woven from the top throughout.

24. Then they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us gamble for it, whose it shall be. In order that the Scripture may be fulfilled, saying, They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast the lot. Then indeed the soldiers did these things.

25. And by the cross of Jesus stood His mother, and the sister of His mother, Mary the mother of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

26. Then Jesus seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved, standing by, said to His mother; Woman, behold, thy son.

27. Then He says to the disciple, Behold, thy mother. And from that hour that disciple received her into his own home.

28. After this, Jesus seeing that all things are already perfected, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.

29. Then a vessel was sitting by full of vinegar: and filling a sponge with vinegar and placing it on the hyssop, they brought it to His mouth.

30. Then when Jesus received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.

31. Then the Jews, in order that the bodies may not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, since it was the Preparation (for the day of that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate, that they might break their legs, and take them down.

32. Then the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first one, and of the other one being crucified along with Him.

33. But having come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs:

34. but one of the soldiers pierced His side through with the spear, and immediately blood and water came out.

35. And He having seen hath testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you also may believe.

36. For these things took place, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of Him shall not be broken.

37. Again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him, whom they have pierced.

38. After these things, Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but having been hidden on account of the fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.

39. And Nicodemus also, the one having come at first to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.

40. Then they received the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linens with aromatics, as is the custom to the Jews to embalm.

41. And there was in the place where He was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which no one was ever yet placed.

42. Then on account of the Preparation of the Jews (because the sepulcher was near), they placed Jesus there. 

## John 20

1. On the first of the Sabbaths Mary Magdalene comes to the sepulcher early in the morning, it being yet dark, and sees the stone having been rolled from the sepulcher.

2. Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have placed Him.

3. Then Peter and the other disciple came out, and they were coming to the sepulcher.

4. And the two were running simultaneously: and the other disciple was running before more rapidly than Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.

5. John looking in sees the grave-clothes lying; and did not come in.

6. Then Simon Peter, following him, he came into the sepulcher; and sees the grave-clothes lying,

7. and the napkin, which was on His head, not lying with the grave-clothes, but separate in one place, having been rolled up.

8. Then the other disciple also came in, the one having come first to the sepulcher, and saw, and believed;

9. for they did not yet understand the Scripture, That it behooved Him to rise from the dead.

10. Then the disciples departed again to their own comrades.

11. And Mary was standing at the sepulcher without, weeping: then while she was weeping, she looked into the sepulcher;

12. and sees two angels sitting in white robes, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus lay.

13. They say to her, Woman, why do you weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have placed Him.

14. Saying these words, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing, and did not know that He is Jesus.

15. Jesus says to her, Woman, why are you weeping? whom are you seeking? She, thinking that He is the gardener, says to Him, Sir, if you have taken Him away, tell me where you have placed Him, and I will take Him.

16. Jesus says to her, Mary: she turning, says to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which is called Teacher.

17. Jesus says to her, Cling not to me; for I have not ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and tell them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.

18. Mary Magdalene comes proclaiming to the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and He spoke these things to her.

19. Then it being evening, on that day, on the first day of the week, and the doors being shut where the disciples were assembled, on account of the fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace be unto you.

20. And saying this, He shewed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced, seeing the Lord.

21. And Jesus said to them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, I also send you.

22. And saying this, He breathed on them, and says to them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.

23. Whose sins you may remit, are remitted unto them; whose sins you may retain, have been retained.

24. And Thomas, one of the twelve, the one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. Then the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. And he said to them, Unless I may see the print of the nails in His hand, and thrust my finger into the place of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.

26. And after eight days His disciples were again within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.

27. Then He says to Thomas, Bring hither your finger, and see my hands, and bring your hand, and cast it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

28. Thomas responded and said to Him, My Lord and my God.

29. Jesus says to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed: happy are those not seeing, and believing.

30. Indeed then Jesus also did many other miracles in the presence of His disciples, which have not been written in this book;

31. and these have been written in order that you may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; and in order that believing you may have life through His name. 

## John 21

1. After these things, Jesus again manifested Himself to His disciples, at the Sea of Tiberias; and He thus manifested Himself.

2. Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael the one from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples, were together.

3. Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to Him, We also go along with you. They went out, and entered into a ship, and that night caught nothing.

4. And it being now morning, Jesus stood on the shore: the disciples did not know that He is Jesus.

5. Then Jesus says to them; Little children, whether have you any meat? They respond to Him, No.

6. He says to them, Cast the net to the right side of the ship, and you will find: then they cast it, and were not able to draw it on account of the multitude of the fishes.

7. Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, He is the Lord. Then Simon Peter hearing that He is the Lord, girded on his fishing-cloak (for he was unclothed), and cast Himself into the sea:

8. and the other disciples came in the ship (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits), drawing the net of the fishes.

9. Then when they came to the land, they see fire lying, and fish and bread lying on it.

10. Jesus said to them, Take from the fishes which you now caught.

11. And Simon Peter came up, and drew the net to the land, full of a hundred and fifty-three large fishes: and there being so many yet the net was not broken.

12. Jesus says to them, Come, take breakfast. But no one of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who art thou? knowing that He is the Lord.

13. Jesus comes, and takes bread, and gives it to them, and fish likewise.

14. And this third time Jesus was already manifested to His disciples, having risen from the dead.

15. Then when they took breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter; Simon, the son of Jonah, dost thou love me with divine love more than these? He says to Him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee as a friend. He says to him; Feed my lambs.

16. Again He says to him a second time, Simon, the son of Jonah, do you love me with divine love? He says to Him; Thou knowest that I love thee as a friend. He says to him; Shepherdize my sheeplings.

17. He says to him a third time; Simon, the son of Jonah, do you love me as a friend? Peter was grieved, because He said to him the third time, Do you love me as a friend? And he says to Him, Lord, thou knowest all things; and thou dost understand that I love thee as a friend. He says to Him, Feed my sheeplings.

18. Truly, truly, I say unto you, When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked about where you wished: but when you get old, you will reach forth your hands, and another will lead you, where you do not wish.

19. And He spoke this, signifying by what death he shall glorify God. And having spoken this, He says to him, Follow me.

20. And Peter turning sees the disciple, whom Jesus loved, following; who also leaned upon His breast in the supper, and said; Lord, who is the one having betrayed thee?

21. Then Peter seeing him says to Jesus; Lord, but what shall he do?

22. And Jesus says to him, If I wish him to tarry until I come, what is that to thee?

23. Then that word went out to the brethren that that disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die; but, If I wish him to tarry until I come.

24. This is the disciple witnessing concerning these things, and having written the same: and we know that his testimony is true.
