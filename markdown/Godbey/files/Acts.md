# Acts

## Acts 1

1. Truly, I made the first history, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,

2. from the day on which, having given commandment through the Holy Ghost to the apostles whom He had chosen, He was received up.

3. To whom He also, after He suffered, manifested Himself alive in many testimonials, being seen by them forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:

4. and being assembled together with them, He commanded them, Not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father which ye heard from me;

5. that John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

6. Therefore indeed having assembled, they asked Him saying, Lord, do you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. He said to them; It is not your province, to know the times or seasons, which the Father placed in His own authority.

8. But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost having come upon you, and shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and all Judea, and in Samaria, and into the extremity of the earth.

9. And having spoken these words, they looking, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him from their eyes.

10. And while they were gazing up into the heaven, He going, and behold, two men stood by them in white garments, who also said,

11. Ye Galilean men, why stand you looking up into the heaven? this same Jesus, the One having been received up into the heaven, will so come in the manner in which you saw Him going up into the heaven.

12. Then they returned into Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, being a journey of a Sabbath day.

13. And when they came in, they went up into the upper room, where Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James, were abiding.

14. They were all persevering of one accord in prayer along with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.

15. And during those days, Peter standing up in the midst of the brethren, said (and the number of names were about one hundred and twenty),

16. Men, brethren, it behooved the scripture which the Holy Ghost predicted through the mouth of David concerning Judas, the one becoming leader to those arresting Jesus, to be fulfilled;

17. because he was numbered among us and received the lot of this ministry.

18. Then indeed he purchased a field by the reward of iniquity, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels burst out;

19. which indeed was known to all those dwelling at Jerusalem, so that field, in their own dialect, is called Acheldamach; that is, field of blood.

20. For it has been written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let there be no one dwelling in it, and let another take his pastorate.

21. Therefore the men having come together with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in unto us and went out,

22. beginning from the baptism of John, until the day on which He was taken up from us, it behooveth one of these to be witness of His resurrection along with us.

23. And they nominated two, Joseph, called Barsabas who was called Justus, and Matthias.

24. And praying they said, Thou, O Lord, Heart-searcher of all, show up the one of these two, whom thou hast chosen

25. to receive the place of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas departed to go into his own place.

26. And they gave lots for them, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 

## Acts 2

1. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all of one accord in the same place.

2. And suddenly there was a sound from heaven as of a mighty, rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And there appeared unto them divided tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them;

4. and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5. And Jews were dwelling at Jerusalem, devout men from every nation, of those under the heaven;

6. and this report prevailing, the multitude came together and was confounded, because they were hearing them speaking each one in his own dialect.

7. And they were all astounded and marveled, saying, Are not all these who are speaking, Galileans?

8. And how do we hear each one in our own dialect in which we were born,

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those inhabiting Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

10. indeed Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya which is beyond Cyrene, and Roman sojourners, both Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking the mighty works of God in our own languages.

12. And all were astounded and bewildered, saying one to another, What does this wish to be?

13. And others mocking, continued to say, that these people are full of fermented wine.

14. And Peter standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke to them: Judean men and all ye dwelling at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and know my words.

15. For these are not drunken, as you suppose; for it is the third hour of the day;

16. but this is that which has been spoken by the prophet Joel;

17. And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;

18. and upon my servants and my handmaidens I will pour out of my Spirit on those days, and they shall prophesy.

19. And I will give wonders in the heavens above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire, and vapor of smoke.

20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great day of the Lord shall come.

21. And it shall come to pass, that every one who may call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

22. Israelitish men, hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man having been demonstrated unto you from God by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, as yourselves know;

23. Him by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, having been delivered, you having nailed up, slew through the hand of lawless men;

24. whom God raised up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was impossible that he should be held by it.

25. For David says in reference to him, I foresaw my Lord always before me, because he is on my right hand, in order that I may not be moved.

26. Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad, and my flesh shall indeed still rest in hope,

27. because thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.

28. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt fill me with gladness with thy countenance.

29. Men, brethren, it is lawful to speak to you with boldness concerning the patriarch David, because he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.

30. Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God swore with an oath, that from the fruit of his loins One should sit upon the throne;

31. foreseeing he spoke concerning the resurrection of Christ, that He was not left in Hades, neither did His flesh see corruption.

32. This Jesus God raised up, whose witnesses we are.

33. Therefore on the right hand of God exalted, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, has poured out this which you both see and hear.

34. For David hath not ascended into the heavens, but he says, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

35. until I may make thy enemies the footstool of thy feet.

36. Then let all the house of Israel assuredly know that God hath made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.

37. And hearing, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, Men, brethren, what must we do?

38. And Peter said to them, Repent, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all who are afar off, so many as the Lord our God may call.

40. And with many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying, Be saved from this wicked generation.

41. Then indeed having received his word they were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added unto them;

42. and they were persevering in the teaching of the apostles and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.

43. And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles in Jerusalem; and there was a great fear upon all.

44. And all those who believed were together and had all things common,

45. and they sold their possessions and personalities, and divided the same unto all, as each one had need.

46. And daily of one accord in the temple they were persevering; and breaking bread from house to house, they received their food with gladness and purity of heart,

47. praising God, and having favor unto all the people. And the Lord was daily adding to them those who were being saved. 

## Acts 3

1. And Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth.

2. And a certain man, being lame from his mother's womb was habitually carried, whom they placed daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those entering into the temple;

3. who seeing Peter and John about to come into the temple, asked to receive alms.

4. And Peter along with John, fixing his attention on him, said, Look unto us.

5. And he gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. Peter said, Silver and gold do not belong to me; but I give thee that which I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk about.

7. And taking him by the right hand he raised him up; and immediately the bottoms of his feet and his ankle-bones were strengthened.

8. And leaping out, he stood, and continued to walk around, and came into the temple with them, walking around and leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking round and praising God.

10. And they recognized him, that he was the one sitting for alms at Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with astonishment and delight at that which had happened to him.

11. And he holding on to Peter and John; all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon's, exceedingly astonished.

12. And Peter seeing them, responded to the people; Israelitish men, why are you astonished at this, or why do you look upon us as having by our own power or holiness, made this man to walk about?

13. The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Child, Jesus, who you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate having decided to release Him.

14. And you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and ask that a man who was a murderer should be delivered unto you,

15. and you slew the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, whose witnesses we are.

16. And through the faith of his name, his name hath made sound this one who you see and know, and through him faith has given unto him this soundness, in the presence of you all.

17. And now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance, as did your rulers also;

18. and those things which God proclaimed through the mouth of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer, he hath thus fulfilled.

19. Repent, therefore, and turn, that your sins may be blotted out, in order that seasons of soul-renewing may come from the presence of the Lord,

20. and he may send forth Jesus, who has been preached unto you as the Christ,

21. whom it behooves heaven indeed to receive until the times of the restitution of all things which God spoke through the mouth of all his prophets from the beginning.

22. Moses indeed said; The Lord our God will raise up to you from your brethren a prophet like unto me; Him you will hear concerning all things so many as he may speak to you.

23. And it shall come to pass, that every soul whosoever will not hear that prophet, shall be cut off from the people.

24. And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and consecutively, so many as spoke, also proclaimed these days.

25. Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, In thy seed shall the families of the earth be truly blessed.

26. To you God, having first raised up his Son, sent him blessing you, in turning each one from your sins. 

## Acts 4

1. And they speaking to the people, the priests and captain of the temple and the Sadducees rose up against them,

2. being grieved because they were teaching the people and preaching the resurrection of the dead through Jesus;

3. and they laid hands on them and put them in prison till the morrow; for it was already evening.

4. And many of those hearing the word believed, and the number of men was about five thousand.

5. And it came to pass on the morrow, the rulers and elders and scribes

6. assembled in Jerusalem, and Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and so many as were of the family of the high priest.

7. And having set them in the midst, asked them, By what power or in what name have you done this?

8. Then Peter being full of the Holy Spirit said to them, Ye rulers of the people and elders,

9. if we are this day judged for the benefaction of the impotent man, by whom he has been saved,

10. let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, through him this man now stands sound in your presence.

11. This is the stone rejected by your builders, which has become the head of the corner.

12. And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name given under heaven among men by which it behooveth us to he saved.

13. And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and apprehending that they are unlearned and ignorant men, they continued to be astonished, and recognized them, that they were with Jesus;

14. and seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

15. And having commanded them to depart out from the assembly, they conferred with one another,

16. saying, What can we do to these men? for that a notable miracle has been wrought by them is indeed manifest to all dwelling at Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it;

17. but that it may extend no further unto the people, let us threaten them to speak no more in this name to any one of men.

18. And having called them, they command them, not at all to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.

19. And Peter and John responding said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than God, judge ye;

20. for we are not able not to speak those things which we have seen and heard.

21. And they having threatened them, in addition sent them away, finding nothing to the end that they can punish them, on account of the people, because all continued to glorify God over that which had taken place;

22. for the man on whom this miracle of healing was wrought was more than forty years old.

23. And having been released they came to their own people, and proclaimed so many things as the chief priests and elders said to them.

24. And having heard, they unanimously lifted up their voice to God, and said, O Lord, thou having created the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things which are in them,

25. the One speaking through the mouth of David, thy child, our father through the Holy Ghost, Wherefore did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

26. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and his Christ.

27. For in truth they were assembled together in this city, against thy holy Child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint; both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,

28. to do so many things as thy hand and thy counsel did foreordain to come to pass.

29. And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to thy servants with all boldness to speak thy word,

30. while, reaching forth thy hand unto healings, both miracles and wonders are wrought through the name of thy holy child Jesus.

31. And they praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.

32. And of the multitude who believed there was one heart and soul, and no one was saying that any of those things which belonged to him were his own, but all things were common to them.

33. And with great power the apostles continued to give witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Lord; and great grace was upon them all.

34. For no one among them was in need; for so many possessions of lands or houses as belonged to them, selling, they were bringing the prices of the things having been sold,

35. and laying them at the feet of the apostles; and it was distributed to each as any one had need.

36. And Joseph called Barnabas by the apostles, which is interpreted, Son of consolation, a Levite, a Cyprian by race,

37. a farm belonging to him, having sold it, he brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles. 

## Acts 5

1. And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold an estate

2. and kept back a part from the price, his wife knowing it along with him; and having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, wherefore hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and keep back a part from the price of the land?

4. Remaining with thee did it not belong to thee; and having been sold, was it not still in thy control? why hast thou placed this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.

5. And Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, breathed out his soul. And great fear came on all hearing;

6. and the young men, rising up, took him, and having carried him out, buried him.

7. And an interval of about three hours supervened, and his wife, not having known what had taken place, came in.

8. And Peter responded to her, Tell me if you sold the place for so much? And she said; Yes, for so much.

9. And Peter said to her; Why has it been agreed with you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of those having buried thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out.

10. And immediately she fell at his feet, and breathed out her soul; and the young men having come in found her dead, and having carried her out, buried her with her husband.

11. And great fear came on all the church, and on all those hearing these things.

12. And many miracles and wonders were wrought by the hands of the apostles among the people. And they were all of one accord in Solomon's porch.

13. And no one of the rest dared to attach himself to them; but the people were magnifying them;

14. but believers were the more added to the Lord, a multitude both of men and women,

15. so that they were carrying the sick into the streets, and placing them on couches and beds, in order that the shadow of Peter passing along might cast a shadow on some one of them.

16. Then a multitude, of the cities around about Jerusalem, came together, carrying their sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed.

17. And the high priest and all those being with him, being the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with rage,

18. and laid hands on the apostles, and placed them in the public prison.

19. And the angel of the Lord, having opened the doors of the prison during the night, and leading them out said,

20. Go, and standing in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.

21. And hearing, they came into the temple at daydawn, and were teaching. And the high priest coming and those with him, called together the sanhedrim and all the eldership of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to bring them.

22. And the officers arriving found them not in the prison; and having returned, reported,

23. saying; We found the prison closed with all safety, and the guards standing at the doors, and having opened, we found no one within.

24. And when the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were at a loss concerning them, what this might be.

25. And a certain one coming announced to them, Behold, the men whom you placed in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.

26. Then the captain along with the officers, having gone away, led them, not with violence, for they feared the people lest they might be stoned.

27. And leading them, they placed them in the council, and the chief priests asked them, saying,

28. With commandment we commanded you not to teach in this name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching; and you are determined to bring upon us the blood of this man.

29. But Peter and the apostles responding said, It behooves us to obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you have slain, hanging him on the wood;

31. Him hath God exalted at His own right hand, a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.

32. And we are witnesses of these words, and the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to those who obey him.

33. And hearing, they were cut through and were minded to kill them.

34. But a certain Pharisee, Gamaliel by name, a teacher of the law, honorable to all the people, rising in the sanhedrim command them to put the men out for a short time,

35. and he said to them; Israelitish men, take heed to yourselves in reference to these men what you are about to do.

36. For before these days Theudas arose, saying that he was somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, adhered, who were slain, and all, so many as confided in him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.

37. After him Judas the Galilean arose, in the days of the enrollment, and led the people after him; he also perished, and all, so many as confided in him, were scattered abroad.

38. And I now say this to you: Stand aloof from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught;

39. but if it be of God, you will not be able to destroy them, lest perchance you may also be found fighting against God.

40. And they obeyed him, and having called the apostles, beating them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and sent them away.

41. Then they departed from the face of the sanhedrim, rejoicing indeed, because they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of his name.

42. And all day in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not teaching and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

## Acts 6

1. And during those days, the disciples multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, that their widows were being neglected in the daily ministration.

2. And the twelve calling to them the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not pleasing that we, leaving the word of God, serve tables.

3. But brethren, look out seven men from you of good report, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this interest;

4. and we will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.

5. And the word was pleasing before all the multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas,

6. the Antiochian proselyte, whom they placed before the apostles, and having prayed, they placed their hands on them.

7. And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied exceedingly in Jerusalem, and a great multitude of the priests were obedient unto the faith.

8. And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and miracles among the people.

9. And certain ones of the synagogues, called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up disputing with Stephen,

10. and they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit with which he was speaking.

11. Then they bribed men, saying, that we have heard him speaking words blasphemous against Moses and God.

12. And they excited the people and the elders and scribes, and coming upon him, seized him, and led him into the council,

13. and they raised up false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against this holy place and the law;

14. for we have heard him saying, that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.

15. And all sitting in the council, having fixed their eyes on him, saw his face as the face of an angel. 

## Acts 7

1. And the high priests said; Are these things so?

2. And he said, Men, brothers and fathers, hear ye; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he migrated into Haran, and He said to him;

3. Come out from thy country and from thy kindred, and come hither into the land which I will show unto thee.

4. And after his father died he migrated himself thence into this country in which you now dwell,

5. and God gave him no inheritance in it, not the step of his foot; and he promised to give it to him, and his seed after him, for an inheritance, there being no child to him.

6. And thus God spoke, that his seed shall sojourn in a strange land, and they will enslave it and oppress it four hundred years.

7. And the nation whom they shall serve I will judge, says God, and after these things they shall come out and serve me in this place.

8. And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac, Jacob; and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs, envying Joseph, sold him into Egypt:

10. and God was with him, and delivered him out of all his troubles, and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh the king of Egypt; and he placed him governor over Egypt and all his house.

11. And the famine came into all the land and Canaan, and great distress: and our fathers found no sustenance.

12. And Jacob hearing that there is food in Egypt, sent away our fathers first.

13. And the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren, and his race became manifest to Pharaoh.

14. And Joseph sending, called to him Jacob his father, and all the family, seventy-five souls.

15. And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he and our fathers died there.

16. And they were carried over into Shechem, and buried in a tomb which Abraham purchased from the sons of Emmor in Shechem with a sum of money.

17. When the time of the promise which God made with Abraham drew nigh, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,

18. until another king arose over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.

19. He dealing fraudulently with our race, afflicted our fathers, that they should expose their infants, so that they should not live.

20. During which time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God; who was kept three months in the house of his father.

21. And he being exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him, and adopted him for a son to herself.

22. And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and was mighty in his words and works.

23. And when the time of the fortieth year was fulfilled to him, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.

24. And seeing a certain one suffering affliction, he interposed, and executed vengeance in behalf of the oppressed one, slaying the Egyptian.

25. And he supposed that his brethren would understand that God through his hand is giving them salvation: but they did not recognize it.

26. On the following day, he appeared to them fighting, and undertook to reduce them to peace, saying, Men, you are brethren; therefore do not injure one another.

27. And the one injuring his neighbor thrust him away, saying, Who appointeth you a leader and a judge over us?

28. whether do you wish to kill me, in the manner in which you slew the Egyptian yesterday?

29. And at this word Moses fled, and became a sojourner in the land of Midia, where he begat two sons.

30. And forty years having passed away, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in the flame of fire of the bramble bush.

31. And Moses, seeing the sight, was astonished: and he coming nigh to investigate, the voice of the Lord came:

32. I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembling, did not dare to investigate.

33. And the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of thy feet: for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.

34. Seeing, I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groaning, and have come down to deliver them. And come now, I will send thee into Egypt.

35. And this Moses whom they denied, saying, Who hath established thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent a ruler and deliverer, with the hand of an angel having appeared unto him in a bush.

36. He led them out, doing wonders and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.

37. This Moses is the one having said to the sons of Israel, A prophet will God raise up to you of your brethren, like unto me.

38. And this is the one being in the church in the wilderness with the angel speaking to him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received the living oracles to give unto us;

39. to whom our fathers were not willing to be obedient, but thrust him away, and turned back in their hearts towards Egypt,

40. saying to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, who led us out from the land of Egypt, we know not what happened to him.

41. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

42. And God turned away, and gave them up to serve the host of the heaven; as has been written in the book of the prophets: Slain victims and sacrifices you have not brought unto me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel.

43. And ye took up the shrine of Moloch, and the star of the god Remphan, images which you made to worship them; and I will transport you beyond Babylon.

44. And the tabernacle of testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, as the one speaking to Moses commanded him to make it according to the example he had seen;

45. which our fathers receiving, brought in along with Joshua in the dispossession of the nations, whom God drove out, from the face of our fathers, until the days of David,

46. who found favor before God, and asked that he should build a tabernacle for the house of Jacob.

47. But Solomon built a house for him.

48. But the Most High dwelleth not in houses built with hands, as the prophet says,

49. Heaven is my throne, and earth the footstool of my feet: What house will you build for me? says the Lord; Or what shall be the place of my rest?

50. Hath not my hand made all of these things?

51. Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye.

52. Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? and they slew those proclaiming concerning the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you became:

53. who received the law in the administrations of angels, and did not keep it.

54. And hearing these words, they were cut through their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him.

55. But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, and looking up to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,

56. and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

57. And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears, and unanimously rushed on him,

58. and casting him out from the city, they began to stone him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, called Saul:

59. and continued to stone Stephen, calling upon the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And putting down his knees, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not impute this sin to them. And saying this, he fell asleep. 

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there was a great persecution in that day against the church in Jerusalem: and all were dispersed abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And godly men buried Stephen, and made great mourning over him.

3. But Saul was laying waste the church, entering into the houses, and arresting men and women, he committed them to prison.

4. Therefore indeed, being dispersed abroad, they went everywhere preaching the word:

5. and Philip, having gone down to the city of Samaria, was preaching Christ to them,

6. And the multitudes were unanimously giving heed to the things spoken by Philip, while they were hearing and seeing the miracles which he was performing.

7. For many of those having unclean spirits, roaring with a loud voice, went out: and many paralyzed and lame were healed;

8. and there was great joy in that city.

9. And a certain man, by name Simon, was formerly practicing magic in the city, and bewitching the nation of Samaria, saying that himself was some great man:

10. to whom all from small even unto the great gave heed, saying, This one is the power of God, called Great.

11. And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had deceived them with his magic arts.

12. But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13. But Simon himself also believed: and being baptized, was constantly with Philip, both seeing the miracles and the great dynamites performed, was astonished.

14. But the apostles in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria has received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John:

15. who, having come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.

16. For he had not yet fallen on any of them: but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

18. But Simon seeing that by the laying on of the hands of the apostles the Spirit was given, offered them money, saying,

19. Give me this power, that on whomsoever I may lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

20. And Peter said to him, Thy silver be unto destruction with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.

21. There is neither part nor lot to thee in this word: for thy heart is not right before God.

22. Therefore repent of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perchance the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee;

23. for I see thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.

24. And Simon responding said, You pray to the Lord for me, in order that none of these things of which you have spoken may come upon me.

25. Then indeed, witnessing and speaking the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.

26. And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go towards the south unto the way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza; the same is desert.

27. And rising up, he departed. And, behold, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, an officer of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury, had been to Jerusalem to worship,

28. and was returning, and sitting upon his chariot he was reading the prophet Isaiah.

29. And the Spirit said to Philip, Go, and join yourself to that chariot.

30. And Philip running forth, heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said; Whether do you understand what you are reading?

31. And he said, How could I, unless some one shall guide me? And he called upon Philip coming up, to sit with him;

32. and the place of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led like a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before the one shearing him is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.

33. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare His generation? because his life is taken from the earth.

34. And the eunuch responding to Philip, said, I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet speak this? concerning himself, or some other man?

35. Philip opening his mouth, and beginning from the same scripture, preached Jesus to him.

36. And while they were journeying along the road, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch says, Behold water; what doth hinder me from being baptized?

37. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both came down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

38. And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more: for he went on his way rejoicing.

39. And Philip was found at Azotus: and going through he preached the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea. 

## Acts 9

1. But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, having come to the high priest,

2. asked from him letters to Damascus against the synagogues, in order that if he should find any being of the way, both men and women, he might lead them bound to Jerusalem.

3. And it came to pass, while prosecuting the journey he drew near to Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven shone around him;

4. and falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord?

5. And He said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.

6. But stand up, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what it behooves thee to do.

7. And the men journeying along with him stood speechless, indeed hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

8. And Saul arose from the ground; and his eyes being open, he saw nothing: but leading him by the hand, they led him into Damascus;

9. and he was three days not seeing, neither did he eat nor drink.

10. And there was a certain disciple in Damascus, Ananias by name; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

11. And the Lord said to him, Arising, go to the street which is called Straight, and seek a Tarsean, by name Saul, in the house of Judas; for, behold, he is praying,

12. and he saw a man, Ananias by name, coming in, and putting his hands on him, in order that he may look up.

13. And Ananias responded, Lord I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem:

14. and he here has authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on thy name.

15. And the Lord said to him, Go: because he is a vessel of election to me, to bear my name both before the Gentiles, and kings, and sons of Israel:

16. for I will show him how many things it behooves him to suffer for my name's sake.

17. And Ananias departed, and came into the house: and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, Jesus, that appeared to you in the way in which thou didst come, hath sent me, that thou mayest look up, and he filled with the Holy Ghost.

18. And immediately there fell from his eyes as scales: and he looked up; and having stood up, was baptized,

19. and having received food, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples who were in Damascus some days;

20. and immediately he was preaching Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.

21. And all those hearing were astonished, and continued to say, Is not this the one laying waste those calling on this name in Jerusalem? and has come hither for this, that he may lead them bound to the chief priests.

22. And Saul continued to be the more filled up with dynamite, and he was confounding the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that Jesus is the Christ.

23. And when many days were being filled up, the Jews issued a verdict to kill him:

24. but their plot was made known to Saul. And they were keeping the gates both day and night in order that they might kill him:

25. and his disciples taking him, let him down through the wall in the night, lowering him in a basket.

26. And arriving in Jerusalem, he was endeavoring to join himself to the disciples: and all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas taking him, led him to the apostles, and related to them how he saw the Lord on the way, and that He spoke to him, and how he preached boldly in Damascus in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them going in and coming out in Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord;

29. and he was speaking and arguing against the Hellenists, and they undertook to kill him.

30. And the brethren, taking cognizance, led him to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.

31. Then indeed the church had peace throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, being edified and progressing in the fear of the Lord; and was being multiplied by the exhortation of the Holy Ghost.

32. And it came to pass, that Peter going through all parts, came down also to the saints living at Lydda.

33. And he found there a certain man, by name Eneas, lying on a bed eight years, who was paralyzed.

34. And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ heals thee: arise, and take up thy bed: and immediately he arose.

35. And all those dwelling at Lydda and Sharon, whosoever saw him, turned to the Lord.

36. But there was a certain disciple in Joppa, by name Tabitha, who being interpreted is called Dorcas: and she was full of good works and alms which she was doing.

37. And it came to pass during those days, she being sick, died: and washing her, they placed her in an upper chamber.

38. And Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter is in it, sent two men to him, entreating him, Do not delay to come unto us.

39. And Peter rising up came along with them; whom, on arrival, they led to the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing him the chitoons and himations, so many as Dorcas made, while with them.

40. And Peter having put them all out, and putting down his knees, prayed; and having turned toward the body, said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and seeing Peter sat up.

41. And having given her his hand, he raised her up, and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.

42. And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed on the Lord.

43. And it came to pass, that he remained some days in Joppa, with one Simon a tanner. 

## Acts 10

1. And a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian,

2. devout, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many alms to the people, and praying to God always;

3. saw openly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius.

4. And he looking upon him, and being afraid, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayer and thine alms have come up for a memorial before God.

5. And now send men to Joppa, and call for a certain Simon, who is called Peter:

6. he is lodging with a certain Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea.

7. And when the angel speaking to him went away, calling two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually;

8. and having related all things to them, he sent them away to Joppa.

9. And on the following day, they traveling, and drawing nigh the city, Peter went up on the house to pray about the sixth hour.

10. And he became hungry, and wished to eat: but they getting it ready, an ecstasy came on him,

11. and he saw the heaven open, and a certain vessel like a great sheet came down, and resting upon the earth with four rope ends:

12. in which were all quadrupeds, and creeping things of the earth, and birds of the heaven.

13. And a voice came to him, Arising, Peter, slay, and eat.

14. And Peter said, By no means, Lord, because I never was in the habit of eating anything unconsecrated and unclean.

15. And the voice again the second time came to him, Whatsoever things God has cleansed, do not count unclean;

16. and this took place the third time; and immediately the vessel was received up into the heaven.

17. And while Peter was at a loss within himself, as to what the vision he saw might be, behold, the men having been sent by Cornelius, making inquiry for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,

18. and having called, they were asking, if Simon, called Peter, lodges there.

19. And Peter meditating concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men are seeking thee;

20. but rising up, come down, and go with them, doubting nothing: because I have sent them.

21. And Peter having come down to the men, said, Behold, I am he whom you are seeking: what is the cause on account of which you are present?

22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a man righteous and fearing God, and being of good report by all the nation of the Jews, was warned by a holy angel to send for thee to come into his house, and to hear words with thee.

23. Then having called them in, he lodged them. And on the following day, rising up he went out with them, and certain ones of the brethren, who were from Joppa went along with him.

24. And on the following day they came into Caesarea; and Cornelius was expecting them, having called together his own relatives and near friends.

25. And when it came to pass that Peter was coming in, Cornelius meeting him, falling down at his feet, worshiped.

26. And Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I also am a man.

27. And conversing with him, he came in, and finds many having come together;

28. and he said to them, You know how it is an unlawful thing for a Jewish man to associate with, or come to one of another nation; and God has shown me not to call any man unconsecrated or unclean.

29. Therefore indeed, being sent for, I came unhesitatingly. Then I make inquiry for what word did you send for me?

30. And Cornelius said, From the fourth day until this hour, indeed the ninth, I was praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in shining apparel,

31. and says, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, and thine alms have been remembered before God.

32. Therefore send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.

33. Then I immediately sent for thee; and thou hast done well being present. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things which have been commanded thee of the Lord.

34. And Peter, opening his mouth, said, In truth I apprehend that God is no respecter of persons:

35. but in every nation the one fearing him, and working righteousness, is acceptable to him;

36. the word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ: he is Lord of all.

37. This word you know, which was throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;

38. Jesus, the one from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and power: who went about doing good, and healing all oppressed by the devil: because God is with Him.

39. And we are witnesses in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they even slew, hanging him on the wood.

40. God raised him on the third day, and gave him to be made manifest;

41. not to all the people, but to the witnesses having been chosen of God, to us, who ate and drank along with him after He arose from the dead:

42. and He commanded us to preach to the people, and to witness that He is the One ordained of God the Judge of the living and the dead.

43. And to Him give all the prophets witness, that every one believing on him receives the remission of sins through His name.

44. Peter yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all those hearing the word.

45. And the faithful ones who were of the circumcision, so many as came along with Peter, were astonished, because the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Gentiles also;

46. for they were hearing them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God.

47. Then Peter responded, Whether is any one able to forbid the water, that these shall not be baptized, whosoever received the Holy Ghost as we indeed?

48. And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to tarry some days. 

## Acts 11

1. But the apostles and brethren being throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also received the word of God.

2. And when Peter went tip to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision interviewed him, say

3. that, You went in unto men having uncircumcision, and ate with them.

4. And Peter beginning expounded unto them consecutively, saying,

5. I was praying in the city Joppa: and I saw a vision in an ecstasy, A certain vessel, like a great sheet, descending from the heaven, sitting down by four rope ends; and came even unto me:

6. into which looking, I was investigating, and I saw quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the birds of the heaven.

7. And I also heard a voice saying to me, Arising, Peter; slay and eat.

8. And I said, By no means, Lord: because nothing unconsecrated or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.

9. And a voice a second time was heard from heaven, Whatsoever things God has cleansed, consider thou not unconsecrated.

10. And this took place three times: and all things were again taken up into the heaven.

11. And, behold, immediately three men were standing at the house in which we were, having been sent to me from Cornelius.

12. And the Spirit said to me, to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brethren went along with me, and we entered into the house of the man.

13. And he proclaimed to us how he saw an angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is called Peter;

14. who will speak words to you, by which you and your whole family may be saved.

15. And when I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.

16. And I remembered the word of the Lord, as He said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

17. Since then God gave unto them the equal gift, as also unto us, believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, to be able to resist God?

18. And hearing these things, they acquiesced, and glorified God, saying, Then God has also given unto the Gentiles repentance unto life.

19. Then indeed those having been dispersed abroad on account of the persecution prevailing over Stephen came through even to Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.

20. And of them there were certain Cyprian and Cyrenean men, who, having come into Antioch, were speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number having believed, turned to the Lord.

22. And the word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem concerning them: and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

23. Who, coming, and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and continued to exhort all, with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord:

24. because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.

25. And he went away to Tarsus, to hunt up Saul: and having found him, led him to Antioch.

26. And it happened unto them, a whole year indeed they assembled in the church, and taught a great multitude: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

27. And during those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. And one of them by name Agabus, standing up, signified through the Spirit that there is about to be a great famine throughout the whole world: which took place under the reign of Claudius.

29. And they determined that each one of them should send to the ministry to the brethren dwelling in Judea, as each one of the disciples was prosperous;

30. and this they did, sending to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. 

## Acts 12

1. But at this time king Herod reached forth his hands to persecute some of those from the church.

2. And he slew James the brother of John with a sword.

3. And seeing that it is pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also: and those were the days of the unleavened bread:

4. whom having seized, he also put in prison, having committed him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; wishing to bring him out to the people after the passover.

5. Then indeed Peter was kept in prison: but prayer to God in his behalf was incessantly made by the church.

6. But when Herod was about to lead him forth, and Peter was sleeping that night between two soldiers, and bound with two chains; and the guards were keeping guard before the door.

7. And, behold, the angel of the Lord stood over him, and a light shone in the house; and having touched the side of Peter, he raised him up, saying; Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

8. And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and put on thy sandals. And he thus did. And he says to him, Throw thy cloak about thee, and follow me.

9. And having come out, he was following; and did not know that it is true which was done by the angel; but he was thinking that he saw a vision.

10. And having come through the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and having come out, they came on to the first street; and the angel immediately departed from him.

11. And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know truly, that the Lord sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, out of all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. And recognizing his whereabouts, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, called Mark; where many were assembled and praying.

13. And he knocking at the door of the gate, a damsel, by name Rhoda, came to hearken:

14. and recognizing the voice of Peter, from joy did not open the gate, but running in, she proclaimed that Peter stands before the gate.

15. And they said to her, You are gone mad; but she persisted that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.

16. But Peter remained knocking: and having opened, they saw him, and were astonished.

17. And he, beckoning to them with his hand to keep silent, related how the Lord led him out from the prison: and said, Proclaim these things to James, and the brethren. And having gone out, he departed into another place.

18. And it being day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers, as to where Peter then was.

19. And Herod having sought him, and found him not, condemning the guards, commanded that they should be put to death; and having gone down from Judea to Caesarea, he tarried.

20. And he was very angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians: and they unanimously came to him, and having persuaded Blastus who was over the chamber of the king, they continued to seek peace; because their country is supported by the kings.

21. But on an appointed day, Herod, invested with his royal apparel, sitting on his tribunal, delivered a discourse to them:

22. and the people shouted, It is the voice of God and not of man.

23. And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not the glory to God; and being eaten by worms, he breathed out his soul.

24. And the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having filled their ministry, taking with them John, called Mark. 

## Acts 13

1. And there were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch; Barnabas, and Symeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenean, and Manahem, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

2. And they ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Now separate unto me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.

3. Then they having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, sent them away.

4. Then they indeed, having been sent away by the Holy Ghost, came down to Seleucia; and thence sailed away to Cyprus.

5. And being in Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they also had John as their helper.

6. And having gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a Jewish false prophet, to whom was the name of Bar-Jesus:

7. who was with Sergius Paulus, the proconsul, an intelligent man. He, having called Barnabas and Saul, sought to hear the word of God;

8. but Elymas the magician (for thus his name is interpreted) opposed them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.

9. And Saul, (who is also Paul), being filled with the Holy Ghost, fixing his eyes on him,

10. said, O thou full of all guile and rascality, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease perverting the right ways of God?

11. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness; and going about he was seeking people to lead him by the hand.

12. Then the deputy, seeing that which took place, believed; being delighted with the teaching of the Lord.

13. And those around Paul having sailed from Paphos, came into Perge of Pamphylia: and John having departed from them returned to Jerusalem.

14. And they having come from Perge, arrived into Picidian Antioch, and having come into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.

15. And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the chief rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if there is any word of consolation to the people in you, speak.

16. And Paul, rising up, and beckoning with his hand said; Israelitish men, and those fearing God, hear.

17. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm led them out of it;

18. and when he supported them about the time of forty years in the wilderness,

19. and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them the inheritance of the land about four hundred and fifty years.

20. And after these things he gave them judges, till Samuel the prophet.

21. And then they asked for a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years;

22. and having deposed him, he raised up to them David for a king; to whom witnessing he also said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who will do all my wishes.

23. From whose seed according to the promise he led forth Jesus, the Savior, to Israel:

24. and John having preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel, before the face of his coming.

25. And when John fulfilled his course, he said, What do you consider me to be? I am not he: but, behold, there comes one after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose.

26. Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you fearing God, unto us the word of this salvation was sent.

27. For those dwelling in Jerusalem, and the rulers, having rejected him, condemning him, have

28. fulfilled the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath; and having found no cause of death, asked Pilate that he should be executed;

29. and when they perfected all the things which had been written concerning him, taking him down from the cross, placed him in a sepulchre.

30. And God raised him from the dead;

31. who appeared to those coming up with him to Jerusalem from Galilee many days, who are now his witnesses to the people.

32. And we preach unto you the promise, which was made to the fathers,

33. that God has fulfilled this unto our children, raising up Jesus, as in the second Psalm it has been written, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

34. And because he raised him up from the dead, no longer about to return to corruption, He has thus said, I will give unto you the faithful mercies of David.

35. Therefore He also says in another place, Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.

36. For David, indeed having served his own generation according to the will of God, went to sleep, and did see corruption:

37. but he, whom God raised up, did not see corruption.

38. Then let it be known unto you, men brethren, that through this one remission of sins is preached:

39. and in him every one believing is justified from all things from which ye were not able to be justified by the law of Moses.

40. Then beware, lest the word which has been spoken by the prophets may come upon you;

41. Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish away: because I work a work in your days, a work which you may not believe, though one may proclaim it to you.

42. And they going out, they continued to entreat them that these words should be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.

43. And the synagogue having been adjourned, many of the Jews and pious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking with them, continued to persuade them to abide in the grace of God.

44. And on the following Sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the word of the Lord.

45. And the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the word spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

46. And Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly, said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you: since you have rejected it, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold we now turn to the Gentiles.

47. For thus the Lord has commanded us, I have placed thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shalt be for salvation unto the extremity of the earth.

48. And the Gentiles hearing, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord: and so many as had been ordained unto eternal life believed:

49. and the word of the Lord was carried throughout all the country.

50. And the Jews stirred up the noble godly women, and the first men of the city, and they raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.

51. And having cast off the dust from their feet against them, they came into Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy, and the Holy Ghost. 

## Acts 14

1. And it came to pass in Iconium at this time, they came together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke in such a manner, that a great multitude both of the Jews and Greeks believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.

3. Then indeed preaching boldly in behalf of the Lord, witnessing to the word of His grace, giving signs and wonders to be wrought by their hands, they spent much time.

4. And the multitude of the city was divided: and some indeed were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.

5. And when there was a conspiracy of both Gentiles and Jews along with their leaders, to insult and stone them,

6. recognizing it, they fled into the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding country;

7. and there they preached the gospel.

8. And there was a certain man sitting there in Lystra, impotent in his feet, being lame from the womb of his mother, who never did walk about.

9. He heard Paul speaking, who fixing his attention on him, and seeing that he had faith to be saved,

10. said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and continued to walk around.

11. And the multitudes seeing what Paul did, lifted up their voice, in Lycaonic, saying, The gods having assumed the likeness of men have come down to us:

12. and they were calling Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, since he was the leader of the speech.

13. And the priest of Jupiter, being in front of the city, having brought oxen and garlands to the gate, wished to offer sacrifices to them, along with the multitudes.

14. And the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, hearing, rending their garments, rushed into the crowd, crying out, and saying,

15. Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of like suffering with you, preaching the gospel to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, who created the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things which are in them:

16. who in bygone generations, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways;

17. indeed he did not leave himself without witnesses, doing good, giving to you the rains from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.

18. And speaking these things they scarcely restrained the multitude from offering sacrifices to them.

19. But the Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the multitudes, stoned Paul, dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead;

20. but, the disciples having surrounded him, rising up, he came into the city. And on the following day he came with Barnabas into Derbe;

21. and preaching the gospel to that city, and making many disciples, they returned into Lystra, and into Iconium, and into Antioch,

22. strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to abide in the faith, and it behooves them through many tribulations to enter into the kingdom of God.

23. And electing elders for them in every church, praying with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.

24. And having come through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.

25. And having spoken the word in Perge, they came down into Attalia;

26. and thence they sailed away into Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

27. And arriving, and convening the church, they reported so many things as God did with them, and that He opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. And they spent no small time with the disciples. 

## Acts 15

1. And certain ones having come down from Judea were teaching the brethren that, Unless you may be circumcised, according to the custom of Moses, you are not able to be saved.

2. And there being no small contention and disputation to Paul and Barnabas against them, they delegated Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question.

3. Then indeed they having been sent away by the church, traveled through both Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they continued to make great joy to all the brethren.

4. And arriving into Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles, and the elders, and they proclaimed so many things as God did with them.

5. And certain one of those from the sect of the Pharisees having believed arose up, saying that, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.

6. And the apostles and elders were convened to see about this problem.

7. And there being much disputation, Peter, having arisen, said to them, Men, brethren, you know that from ancient days God chose among you, that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel through my mouth, and believe.

8. And God, who knows the heart, witnessed to them, giving to them the Holy Ghost, as also to us;

9. and made no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

10. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

11. But through the grace of our Lord Jesus, we believe that we are saved, in the same manner in which they are also.

12. And the whole multitude became silent, and continued to hear Barnabas and Paul, relating how many miracles and wonders God wrought among the Gentiles through them.

13. And after they became silent, James responded, saying, Men, brethren, hear me.

14. Symeon hath related how God in the first place interposed to take a people from the Gentiles, in His name.

15. And to this corresponds the words of the prophet; as has been written,

16. After these things I will return, and will build again the throne of David, which has fallen down; and will build again the ruins of the same, and will set it up again:

17. in order that the residue of men may seek out the Lord, even all the Gentiles, on whom my name has been called upon them, says the Lord, who doeth these things

18. known from the beginning.

19. Therefore I judge, that we should not burden those from the Gentiles turning to God:

20. but to command them to abstain from things offered to idols, and from fornication, and from strangulation, and from blood.

21. For Moses from ancient generations, has those preaching him in every city, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.

22. Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, along with the whole church, to send men chosen from them into Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas; Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brethren:

23. having written through their hand; The apostles and elders, brethren to the brethren who are from the Gentiles throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia greeting.

24. Since we heard that certain ones having come out from us troubled you, disturbing your souls with words which we did not command:

25. it seemed good to us, being of one accord, having chosen men to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. men who have imperiled their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, themselves also proclaiming the same things by speech.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no more burden than these necessary things,

29. to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which keeping yourselves, you will do well. Fare ye well.

30. Then indeed they, having been sent away, came down into Antioch, and convening the multitude, they delivered the letter.

31. And having read it, they rejoiced over the consolation.

32. Both Judas and Silas, themselves also being prophets, exhorted the brethren with elaborate speech, and strengthened them;

33. and having spent the time, they were discharged by the brethren with peace back to the apostles who sent them.

34. And Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, also along with many others.

35. And after many days Paul said to Barnabas, Having returned let us now visit the brethren in every city in which we preached the word of the Lord, how they are doing.

36. But Barnabas advised to take with them John, also called Mark.

37. But Paul thought that he would not take with them, him who having departed from them from Pamphylia, and not having gone along with them into the work.

38. But there was a paroxysm, so that they parted from one another, and Barnabas, taking Mark, sailed away into Cyprus.

39. And Paul, having chosen Silas, went out, committed to the grace of the Lord by the brethren;

40. and he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. 

## Acts 16

1. And he arrived into Derbe and Lystra. And, behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timothy, the son of a faithful Jewish woman, and a Greek father,

2. who was of good report by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.

3. Paul wished him to go out with him; and having taken him circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places: for they all knew his father that he was a Greek.

4. And while they were traveling through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees which were adjudicated by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, to keep.

5. Then the churches were indeed strengthened in faith, and abounded in number daily.

6. And they traveled through Phrygia and the Galatian country, being prohibited by the Holy Ghost from speaking the word in Asia.

7. And having come opposite Mysia, they were endeavoring to go on into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;

8. and having come through Mysia they descended into Troas.

9. And a vision was seen by Paul during the night: Some Macedonian man was standing and entreating him and saying, Having come over into Macedonia, help us.

10. And when he saw the vision, we immediately sought to depart into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

11. And having embarked from Troas, we sailed directly to Samothrace, and on the following day into Neapolis,

12. and thence into Philippi, which is the first city of the Macedonian region, a colony. And we were in that city spending some days.

13. And on the Sabbath day we went out from the gate by the river, where we were accustomed that prayer should be, and having sat down, we spoke to the women having assembled.

14. And a certain woman Lydia by name, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshiping God, was hearing us: whose heart the Lord opened to give attention to the words spoken by Paul.

15. And when she and her household were baptized, she entreated us, saying, If you have found me to be faithful to the Lord, having come into my house, abide: and she constrained us.

16. And it came to pass, we going to the prayer, a certain damsel having a spirit of divination met us, who brought much gain to her masters telling fortunes.

17. She, following Paul and us, continued to cry out, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.

18. And she continued to do this many days. And Paul, being worn out, and turning round, said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from her. And he came out the same hour.

19. And her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, arresting Paul and Silas, dragged them into the forum to the rulers,

20. and leading them to the magistrates, said, These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews,

21. and they proclaimed customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, or to do, being Romans.

22. And the crowd stood up together against them: and the magistrates tearing off their garments, commanded the lictors to beat them with rods.

23. And having laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them safely:

24. who, having received such a charge, cast them into the interior prison, and fastened their feet into the wood.

25. But at midnight Paul and Silas, praying, continued to sing praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.

26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all were loosed.

27. And the jailer, being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison open, seizing a sword, was about to kill himself, thinking that his prisoners had escaped.

28. But Paul shouted with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are here.

29. And having asked for a light, he sprang in, and being alarmed, he fell down before Paul and Silas,

30. and leading them out said, Sirs, what does it behoove me to do in order that I may be saved?

31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou and thy household shall be saved.

32. And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, along with all who were in his house.

33. And taking them that hour of the night, he washed the blood from their stripes; and he and his were baptized immediately:

34. and leading them into his house, he set a table by them, and rejoiced throughout his house, having believed in God.

35. But it being day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying, Send away these men.

36. And the jailer proclaimed these words to Paul, The magistrates have sent word that you may be released: now therefore having gone out, depart in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, being Roman men, they cast us into prison, and now do they cast us out privately? for no; but having come themselves let them lead us out.

38. And the lictors proclaimed these words to the magistrates. And hearing that they are Romans, they were alarmed;

39. and having come they called for them, and leading them out, requested them to go away from their city.

40. And having come out from the prison they came to Lydia, and seeing the brethren, comforted them, and departed. 

## Acts 17

1. And having traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came into Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. And according to custom to Paul, he came in unto them, and for three Sabbaths he expounded unto them from the scriptures,

3. opening and proving, that it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is the Christ.

4. And certain ones of them were persuaded, and identified themselves with Paul and Silas, and of the pious Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.

5. But the Jews giving away to jealousy, and receiving to themselves certain wicked men of those around the forum, and raising a mob, continued to put the city in an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they were seeking to lead them out to the people:

6. but not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, roaring that, These who have turned the world upside down are also come hither;

7. whom Jason has received: and all these are doing contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another King, Jesus.

8. And they excited the rabble and the city rulers hearing these things;

9. and having received satisfaction from Jason and the others they sent them away.

10. But the brethren immediately sent away both Paul and Silas to Berea by night, who coming into the synagogue of the Jews departed;

11. but these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all enthusiasm, searching the scriptures daily, if these things are so.

12. Then indeed many of them believed, and of the noble Greek women and men, not a few;

13. but when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea, they came thither also, agitating and stirring up the rabbles.

14. But immediately at that time the brethren sent away Paul to travel even to the sea: and Silas and Timothy remained there.

15. But having embarked Paul, they led him even to Athens: and receiving commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed from him.

16. But Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, seeing the city devoted to idolatry.

17. Then indeed he spoke to the Jews, and to the worshipers in the synagogue, and to those incidentally meeting him every day in the forum.

18. And certain ones of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers interviewed him, and some continued to say, What would this babbler wish to say? and others said, He seems to be the propagator of strange divinities: because he was preaching the gospel of Jesus, and the resurrection.

19. And taking him, they led him to the Areopagus, saying; Are we able to know what is this new teaching, spoken by thee?

20. For you bring certain strange things to our hearing: therefore we desire to know what these things wish to be.

21. But all the Athenians and itinerant strangers were accustomed to devote their time to nothing else, than to tell something new, or to hear something.

22. And Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Athenian men, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.

23. For going through, and seeing your devotions, I also found an altar on which it was superscribed, To THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore I now preach unto you Him whom you are ignorantly worshiping.

24. God having made the world and all things which are in it, being himself Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;

25. neither is he worshiped by human hands, as if needing something, Himself having given life, and breath, and all things to all;

26. and of (one) man he created every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined their predestinated times, and the boundaries of their habitation;

27. that they should seek God, if perhaps indeed they might feel after him, and find him, though not being far from each one of you.

28. For in him we live and move and have our being, as indeed certain ones of your own poets have said, For we are truly his offspring.

29. Then being the offspring of God, we ought not to think that divinity is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the invention of art and the device of man.

30. Then indeed God winking at the times of ignorance, now commands all men everywhere to repent:

31. as He has appointed a day, in which he is about to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; giving faith to all, having raised Him from the dead.

32. And having heard the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: others said; We will hear thee concerning this even again.

33. So Paul went out from their midst.

34. But certain men, having adhered to him, believed; among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman Damarias by name, and others along with them. 

## Acts 18

1. After these things having departed from Athens, he came to Corinth.

2. And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, a Pontic by race, having recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife; because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: he came to them:

3. and because they were of the same craft, abode with them, and they labored: for they were tentmakers by trade.

4. And he spoke in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.

5. And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was straitened with the word, witnessing to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

6. And they opposing, and blaspheming, shaking his garments, he said to them, Your blood be upon your own head; I am pure: from now I will go to the Gentiles.

7. And having departed thence, he came into the house of a certain Titus, Justus by name, worshiping God, whose house is joined to the synagogue.

8. But Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

9. And the Lord spoke to Paul in the night through a vision, Fear not, but speak, and be not silent:

10. because I am with thee, and no man shall assault thee to hurt thee: because there is much people to me in this city.

11. And he spent a year and six months teaching the word of God among them.

12. But Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of one accord arose up against Paul, and led him to the tribunal,

13. saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to law.

14. And Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were some injustice or wicked rascality, O Jews, I would bear with you according to reason:

15. but if there are questions about the words and name, and law appertaining to you, yourselves shall see to it; I do not wish to be judge of these things.

16. And he drove them away from the tribunal.

17. And all taking Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the tribunal; and nothing of these things was a care to Gallio.

18. And Paul, still remaining some days, having bidden adieu to the brethren, sailed away to Syria, and along with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea; for he had a vow.

19. And they arrived in Ephesus, and he left them there: and himself, having gone into the synagogue, spoke to the Jews.

20. And they asking him to remain a longer time, he did not consent;

21. but having bidden them adieu; and saying, I will return unto you again, God willing; he embarked from Ephesus;

22. and having come into Caesarea, having gone up, and saluted the church, he came down to Antioch;

23. having spent some time, he went from them, traveling consecutively through the Galatian country and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.

24. And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came into Ephesus, being mighty in the scriptures.

25. And he was instructed in the way of the Lord, and zealous in spirit, was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John;

26. and he began to preach boldly in the synagogue. But Priscilla and Aquila, having heard him, took him to themselves, and expounded unto him the way of the Lord more perfectly.

27. And he wishing to go into Achaia, the brethren having sent him forth wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who, being present, conferred much on those having believed through grace.

28. For he vehemently argued down the Jews, publicly, showing through the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. 

## Acts 19

1. And it came to pass, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul having come through the upper regions came down into Ephesus: and found certain disciples,

2. and said to them, Have you received the Holy Ghost, having believed? And they said to him, But we have not heard if the Holy Ghost is (given).

3. And he said, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into the baptism of John.

4. And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on the one coming after him, that is Jesus.

5. And they, having heard, were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;

6. and Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they continued to speak with tongues, and prophesy.

7. And they were all about twelve men.

8. And having come into the synagogue, he preached boldly three months, expounding and persuading them as to the things concerning the kingdom of God.

9. But when some were becoming hardened and disbelieving, speaking evil of the way in the presence of the multitude, departing from them he separated his disciples, daily expounding in the school of Tyrannus.

10. And this took place two years; so that all dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

11. And God was working great miracles through the hands of Paul;

12. so that napkins and aprons were carried from his body and placed on the sick, and diseases departed from them, and evil spirits went out of them.

13. And certain ones of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to call the name of the Lord Jesus, over those having evil spirits saying, I adjure you in the name of Jesus whom Paul is preaching.

14. And there were certain seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish high priest, doing this.

15. But the evil spirit responding said to them, I know Jesus, and am acquainted with Paul; but who are you?

16. And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaping on them, domineering over both of them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

17. And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified;

18. and many of those having believed came, confessing, and renouncing their practices.

19. And many of those practicing curious arts, having brought their books, burnt them before all: and they estimated the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. Thus the word of the Lord increased and accumulated strength according to His power.

21. And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in spirit, having traveled through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on into Jerusalem, saying that, After I am there it behooves me also to see Rome.

22. And having sent two of those ministering to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, himself spent the time in Asia.

23. And at that time there was no small commotion concerning the way.

24. For a certain Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making silver shrines of Diana, was bringing no small gain to the mechanics,

25. whom having assembled and the laborers about such things, he said, Men, you know that it is from this work that prosperity is to us:

26. and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, that this Paul having persuaded them has turned away a great multitude, saying that there are no gods made with hands.

27. And not only is this interest in danger to us to come into disrepute; but even the temple of the great goddess Diana to be considered for nought, and they are about even to despise the majesty of her, whom all Asia and the world worships.

28. And hearing and being filled with rage, they continued to cry out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

29. And the city was filled with commotion: and they rushed of one accord into the theatre, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, the Macedonians, the companions of Paul.

30. And Paul wishing to go in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not;

31. and certain ones of the Asiatic rulers, also being friends to him, having sent to him, continued to entreat him not to give himself up into the theatre.

32. Then indeed they continued to cry out some one thing, and some another: for the church was confused; and the most of them did not know on account of what they had come together.

33. And some from the crowd forced in Alexander, the Jews precipitating him forward; and Alexander, beckoning with his hand, wished to apologize to the people.

34. But recognizing that he is a Jew, there was one voice from all crying out about two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

35. And the city clerk having dismissed the multitudes, said, Ephesian men, for what one of men is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the statue having fallen down from Jupiter?

36. Therefore these things being unquestionable, it is necessary that you become calm, and do nothing rashly.

37. For you have led in these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor are they blaspheming your goddess.

38. If indeed therefore Demetrius, and the mechanics along with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are in session, and there are lawyers: let them implead one another.

39. But if you are seeking something concerning other things, it shall be settled in the lawful church.

40. For indeed we are in danger of prosecution for the disturbance this day, there being no cause concerning which we shall be able to give a reason for this uproar.

41. And having said these things, he dismissed the church. 

## Acts 20

1. After the uproar ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, bidding them adieu, departed to go into Macedonia.

2. And having come through those regions, and exhorted them with much speaking, he came into Greece;

3. and having remained three months, a plot rising against him from the Jews, when about to sail for Syria, he was of a mind to return through Macedonia.

4. And Sopater the (son) of Pyrrhus, the Berean, and Aristarchus, the Thessalonian, and Secundus; and Gaius the Derbean, and Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus the Asiatics, accompanied him;

5. and these having gone in advance, awaited us in Troas;

6. and we, after the days of unleaven bread, sailed from Philippi, and came to them into Troas within five days; where we spent seven days.

7. And on the first of the Sabbaths we being assembled to break bread, Paul spoke to them, being about to depart the following day, and continued his discourse till midnight:

8. and there were many lamps in the upper room, where we were assembled.

9. Paul speaking more prolixly, there was a certain young man, Eutychus by name, sitting in the window, being borne down with deep sleep, completely relaxed by sleep, fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.

10. And Paul, having come down, fell on him, and taking him in his arms said, Fear not; for his soul is in him:

11. and having come up, and broken the bread, and eaten, and talking a long time, until daydawn, thus he departed.

12. And they led up the boy alive, and were comforted exceedingly.

13. But we, having come in advance to the ship, embarked for Assos, thence being about to take up Paul, for he had so commanded us, himself being about to go on foot.

14. And when he met us at Assos, taking him up, we came to Mitylene.

15. And thence having sailed away on the following day we arrived opposite Chios; and on the following day we touched at Samos, and on the next day we came into Miletus.

16. For Paul decided to sail by Ephesus, in order that it might not be necessary for him to spend the time in Asia: for he was hastening, if it might be possible for him to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.

17. And having sent from Miletus into Ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.

18. And when they came to him, he said to them, You know, that from the first day from which I came unto Asia, how I was with you all the time,

19. serving the Lord with all humility, and tears, and temptations, which came upon me through the plots of the Jews:

20. how I omitted nothing of those things which are profitable, that I should not declare unto you and teach you publicly and from house to house,

21. witnessing both to Jews, and to Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, behold, I go to Jerusalem bound in spirit, not knowing the things which shall come upon me in it:

23. except that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesses to me, saying that bonds and tribulations await me.

24. But I consider my life worthy of no consideration to myself, so as to finish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.

25. And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I came preaching the gospel of the kingdom, shall see my face no more.

26. Therefore I witness to you this clay, that I am pure from the blood of all men;

27. for I did not shrink to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

28. Take heed to yourselves, and all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost has placed you shepherds, to shepherdise the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.

29. I know, that after my departure grievous wolves will rise up against you, not sparing the flock;

30. and men from you yourselves will rise up, speaking perverse things, in order to lead away disciples after them.

31. Watch therefore, remembering, that three years night and day I ceased not admonishing you with tears.

32. And now I commend you to God and the word of His grace, who is able to edify you, and give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.

33. I have not sought the silver, or gold, or raiment of any one;

34. you yourselves know, that these hands did minister to my necessities, and those along with me.

35. I have shown you all things, that it so behooveth you laboring to assist the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

36. And having said these things, putting down his knees along with them all, he prayed.

37. And the weeping of all was great, and falling on the neck of Paul, they continued to kiss him copiously,

38. being especially grieved at the word which he had spoken, that they were about to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. 

## Acts 21

1. And when it came to pass, that we having been farewelled by them, embarked, sailing straight forward, we arrived at Cos, and on the following day to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.

2. And finding a ship sailing into Phoenicia, having embarked, we moved out.

3. And coming in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and disembarked at Tyre: for there the ship was delivering her cargo.

4. And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who continued to say to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go to Jerusalem.

5. And when it came to pass that we refitted during those days, having come out, we departed, all sending us forth, along with the women and children, out of the city: and putting down the knees on the shore, having prayed,

6. we farewelled one another, and went up into the ship; and they returned to their own homes.

7. And we continuing our voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained with them one day.

8. And on the following day, having come out, we came into Caesarea: and having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, being one of the seven, we abode with him.

9. And there were to him four virgin daughters, prophesying.

10. And we remaining many days, a certain prophet, by name Agabus, came down from Judea;

11. and having come to us, and taking the girdle of Paul, binding his own feet and hands, said, These things says the Holy Ghost, The man whose girdle this is, will the Jews in Jerusalem bind and deliver into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. And when we heard these words, both we, and the citizens, exhorted him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. Then Paul responded and said, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And he not being persuaded, we acquiesced, saying, Let the will of the Lord be done.

15. And after those days, taking our luggage, we went up to Jerusalem:

16. and some of the disciples from Caesarea went along with us, bringing Mnason a certain Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.

17. And we being in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

18. And on the following day, Paul goes with us to James; and all the elders assembled.

19. And having saluted them, he related each one of those things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.

20. And they hearing, continued to glorify God, and said to him, You see, brother, how many myriads there are of those who believe; and they are all zealots of the law:

21. and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou art teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles apostasy from Moses, saying that they are not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.

22. Then what is it? it is altogether necessary that the multitude come together: for they will hear that you have come.

23. Therefore do this which we tell thee. There are four men among us having a vow upon them;

24. taking them, be purified along with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their head: and all shall know that there is nothing of those things they have been informed concerning thee; but that thyself art walking, keeping the law.

25. But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent to them, adjudicating that they keep themselves from idolatry, and blood, and strangulation, and fornication.

26. Then Paul, having taken the men, the next day being purified along with them, enters into the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment of the days of purification, until an offering may be made for each one of them.

27. And when the seven days were about to have an end, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole multitude, and laid hands on him, crying out,

28. Israelitish men, help: this is the man, teaching all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and he has even yet led Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.

29. For they saw Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul led into the temple.

30. And the whole city was excited, and there was a commotion of the people: and taking Paul, they dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were closed.

31. And seeking to kill him, the report went up to the chiliarch of the band, that all Jerusalem is in commotion;

32. who immediately, taking soldiers and centurions, ran to them: and they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, ceased beating Paul.

33. Then the chiliarch, having come nigh, took Paul, and commanded that he should be bound with two chains; and was making inquiry who he might be, and what he had done.

34. And they continued to cry aloud in the multitude, some one thing, and some another: and he, being unable to know the certainty on account of the uproar, commanded that he should be led into the castle.

35. Then when he was on the threshold, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the mob;

36. for the multitude of the people were following, crying out, Take him away.

37. And Paul, being about to be led into the castle, says to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say something to thee? And he said, Do you speak Greek?

38. Are you not that Egyptian who before these days rising up and leading away into the desert four hundred men of daggers?

39. But Paul said, I am indeed a Jewish man, a Tarsean, a citizen of Cilicia, no mean city: but, I pray you, permit me to speak to the people.

40. And he permitting, Paul, standing on the threshold, beckoned with his hand to the people: and there being great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying: 

## Acts 22

1. Men, brethren, and fathers, hear now my apology unto you.

2. And hearing that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept silent the more.

3. And he says, I am Jewish man, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, having been brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the accuracy of patristic law, being a zealot of God, as you all are this day;

4. who after this way persecuted unto death, binding and committing to prison both men and women;

5. as the high priest also, and all the eldership, witnessed me: from whom having also received letters from the brethren in Damascus, I was on my way, being about to lead them also hither into Jerusalem bound, that they might be punished.

6. And it came to pass, while I was journeying, and nigh unto Damascus, a great light, about midday, suddenly shone from heaven around me;

7. and I felt upon the ground, and heard a voice, saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

8. And I responded, Who art thou, Lord? And He said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou art persecuting.

9. And those being along with me saw the light indeed, but heard not the voice of the one speaking to me.

10. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rising up, go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which have been ordained for thee to do.

11. And when I did not see on account of the glory of that light, and being led by the hand by those journeying with me, I came into Damascus.

12. And a certain Ananias, a man godly according to the law, and of good report by all the Jews dwelling there,

13. having come to me, and standing over me, said, Brother Saul, look up. And I at that hour looked up unto him.

14. And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee to know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice from His mouth;

15. because thou shalt be a witness for Him to all men of those things which thou hast seen and heard.

16. And now why tarriest thou? arising, be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on His name.

17. And it happened unto me, having returned into Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I was in an ecstasy;

18. and I saw Him speaking to me, Hasten, and depart quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

19. And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and binding those believing on thee throughout the synagogue;

20. and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of those killing him.

21. And He said to me, Go: because I will send thee far away to the Gentiles.

22. And they continued to hear him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Take away such a one from the earth: for it is not appropriate for him to live.

23. And they crying out, and rending their garments, and throwing dust into the air,

24. the chiliarch commanded that he should be led into the castle, saying that he should be tested by scourges, in order that he might know on account of what cause they continued so to cry out against him.

25. And when they were extending him to the scourges, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?

26. And the centurion hearing, having come to the chiliarch, announced to him, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.

27. And the chiliarch, having come to him, said; Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.

28. And the chiliarch responded, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was indeed born (a Roman citizen).

29. Then immediately those about to scourge him departed from him: and the chiliarch also feared, knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.

30. And on the following day, wishing to know the certainty as to what he is accused of by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the sanhedrin to come together, and leading down Paul, he placed him in their midst. 

## Acts 23

1. And Paul, looking the sanhedrim in the face, said, Men, brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God unto this day.

2. And the high priest Ananias commanded those standing near him to smite him in the mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, God is about to smite thee, thou whitewashed wall: indeed thou art sitting judging me according to the law, and dost thou command me to be smitten contrary to the law?

4. And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God?

5. And Paul said, Brethren, I did not know that he is the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.

6. And Paul knowing that one part of them belongs to the Sadducees, and another to the Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of the Pharisees: concerning the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am judged.

7. And he speaking this, there was a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

8. For the Sadducees indeed say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

9. And there was a great clamor: and certain ones of the scribes on the part of the Pharisees, rising up, continued to strive, saying, We find nothing evil in this man: but has a spirit or an angel spoken to him?

10. And the dissension being great, the chiliarch fearing lest Paul may be torn to pieces by them, commanded the army, having gone down, to take him from their midst, and lead him into the castle.

11. And on the following night, the Lord standing over him, said, Take courage: for as thou hast testified to the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so it behooveth thee also to testify to me in Rome.

12. And it being day, the Jews having formed a conspiracy, obligated themselves by an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they might kill Paul.

13. And there were more than forty having made this plot:

14. who, having come to the chief priests and elders, said, We have anathematized ourselves with an anathema, to taste nothing until we may kill Paul.

15. Now therefore do you appeal to the chiliarch along with the sanhedrim, that he may lead him down to you, as about to investigate matters concerning him more thoroughly: and we are ready to kill him before he comes nigh.

16. And the son of Paul's sister, having heard of ambuscade, coming and entering into the castle, reported it to Paul.

17. And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Lead this young man to the chiliarch: for he has something to tell him.

18. Then indeed taking him, he led him to the chiliarch, and says, Paul the prisoner, having called me, requested me to lead this young man to you, having something to tell you.

19. And the chiliarch taking him by the hand, and having gone away privately, asked him, What is that which you have to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have entered into an agreement to ask you that to-morrow you may lead Paul to the sanhedrim, as about to make inquiry as to something more definite concerning him.

21. Therefore do not be persuaded by them: for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, who have obligated themselves by an oath, neither to eat nor drink until they may kill him: and now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you.

22. Then indeed the chiliarch sent away the young man, having commanded him to Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.

23. And having called a certain two of the centurions, he said, Get ready two hundred soldiers that they may go unto Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, from the third hour of the night;

24. and prepare beasts of burden, that, having carried away Paul, you may deliver him safe to Felix the governor.

25. Writing a letter having this form:

26. Claudius Lysias to the most noble governor Felix, greeting.

27. This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be put to death by them, having interposed with my army, I took out of their hands, having learned that he is a Roman:

28. and wishing to know the cause on account of which they clamored against him, I led him into their sanhedrim:

29. whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, having no charge worthy of death or bonds.

30. And a plot from them being revealed to me to be against the man, I sent him to thee, having commanded his accusers also to speak in thy presence.

31. Then indeed the soldiers, according to that which had been commanded them, taking Paul led him by night to Antipatris:

32. And on the following day letting the cavalry go on with him, they returned to the castle.

33. Who, having come into Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, also committed Paul to him.

34. And having read, and made inquiry of what jurisdiction,

35. and ascertaining that he is from Cilicia, said, I will hear thee, when thy accusers may also be present, having commanded that he should be kept in Herod's judgment hall. 

## Acts 24

1. And after five days Ananias the high priest with certain elders, and a certain orator Tertyllus, came down, who appeared before the governor against Paul.

2. And he having been called, Tertyllus began to accuse him, saying,

3. Receiving great peace through thee, and prosperity accruing to this nation through thy wisdom, we receive with all gratitude, both always, and everywhere, O most noble Felix.

4. But in order that I may not weary you excessively, I exhort you to hear us patiently according to your clemency.

5. For having found this man pestilential, and stirring up seditions to all the Jews who are throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

6. who also endeavored to pollute the temple: whom we indeed arrested,

7. with whom you yourself, having made inquiry, are able to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him.

8. And the Jews were consenting, saying, Truly these things are so.

9. And Paul responded, the governor beckoning to him to speak; Knowing you to be a judge to this nation from many years, I cheerfully apologize as to the things concerning myself:

10. you being able to know, that there are not more than twelve days to me since I came up to Jerusalem to worship.

11. Neither did they find me in the temple disputing with any one, or causing an excitement of the multitude, neither in the synagogues, nor throughout the city:

12. neither are they able to prove before you the things which they are now accusing me.

13. But I confess this to you, that according to the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of our fathers, believing all things which have been written in the law and in the prophets:

14. having hope towards God, which they themselves also receive, that there is going to be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.

15. In this I also exercise, to always have a conscience void of offense toward God and men.

16. And after many years I came to do alms and offerings to my race;

17. in which they found me having been purified in the temple, not with rabble, nor with an uproar; and were certain Jews from Asia,

18. whom it behooves to be present before me, and accuse me, if they should have anything against me.

19. Or let them tell what injustice they found, while I was standing before the sanhedrim,

20. except concerning this one voice, which I cried out standing in their midst, that concerning the resurrection of the dead I am judged before you this day.

21. And Felix having learned more thoroughly the things concerning the way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch may come down, I will diagnose the things appertaining to you:

22. having commanded the centurion to keep him, and let him have liberty, and prohibit no one of his friends from ministering unto him.

23. And after certain day, Felix with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, coming, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith which is towards Christ Jesus.

24. And he reasoning concerning righteousness and temperance and the coming judgment, Felix, being alarmed, responded, Go thy way for this time; and having received an opportunity, I will call for thee:

25. at the same time also hoping that money will be given to him by Paul; therefore indeed the more frequently sending for him, he conversed with him.

26. But two years having passed away Felix received Porcius Festus as his successor: and Felix, wishing to confer on the Jews a favor, left Paul bound. 

## Acts 25

1. Then Festus having entered upon his office, after three days went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem;

2. and both the chief priests and the first men of the Jews appeared before him against Paul, and continued to entreat him,

3. asking favor against him, in order that he might send him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on the road.

4. Then indeed Festus responded, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and himself was about to go away quickly:

5. Then, says he, Let the influential ones among you, coming down, accuse him, if there is anything wrong in the man.

6. And having tarried with them not more than eight or ten days, having come down to Caesarea, on the following day, sitting on the tribunal, he commanded that Paul should be brought forth.

7. And he being present, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him charges many and heavy, which they were not able to prove.

8. And Paul apologizing, that Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I done anything wrong.

9. And Festus, wishing to confer a gratification on the Jews, responding to Paul, said, Are you willing, having gone up to Jerusalem, there to be judged by me concerning these things?

10. And Paul said, I am standing at the tribunal of Caesar, where it behooves me to be judged. To the Jews I have done nothing wrong, as you indeed well know.

11. If therefore I indeed am guilty of unrighteousness, and have done anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die: but if nothing of these things of which they accuse me is true, no man is able to gratify them (by my death): I appeal unto Caesar.

12. Then Festus, having spoken with the council, responded, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar; thou shalt go unto Caesar.

13. And some days having passed away, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, saluting Festus.

14. And while they were spending many days there, Festus expounded to the king the matters appertaining to Paul, saying, A certain man has been left a prisoner by Felix:

15. concerning whom, I being in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews appeared before me, asking condemnation against him;

16. to whom I responded, that it is not the customs to the Romans to slay any man gratuitously, before that the accused may have his accusers face to face, and receive a place of defence concerning the charge.

17. Then they, having come together to this place, making no delay, immediately sitting on the judgment-seat, I commanded that the man should be led forth;

18. concerning whom his accusers standing by, brought no evil charge of those things which I supposed:

19. but they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion, and about a certain Jesus, who is dead, whom Paul was saying that He is alive.

20. And I, being at a loss as to the question concerning these things, asked him if he is willing to go to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things.

21. And Paul having demanded that he should be kept for the diagnosis of Augustus, I demanded that he should be kept until I shall send him to Caesar.

22. And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would wish to hear the man. He says, To-morrow you shall hear him.

23. Then on the following day, Agrippa and Bernice having come with great pomp, and entering into the auditorium, along with the chiliarchs, and chief men of the city, and, Festus commanding, Paul was led forth.

24. And Festus says, O king Agrippa, and all ye men present with us, you see this man, concerning whom the whole multitude of the Jews is besieging me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that it does not behoove him to live any longer.

25. But I discovered that he had done nothing worthy of death, however he himself appealing to Caesar, I decided to send him.

26. Concerning whom I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have led him to you, and especially to thee, O king Agrippa, in order that, there being an investigation, I may have something which I shall write;

27. for it seems to me to be unreasonable, sending a prisoner, and not to signify charges against him. 

## Acts 26

1. And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted to thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul reaching forth his hand, proceeded with his defence:

2. O king Agrippa, I consider myself happy, being about this day to make my defence before thee concerning all those things of which I am accused by the Jews:

3. especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews: therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.

4. Moreover indeed all the Jews know my life from my youth; being from the beginning in my nation and in Jerusalem,

5. knowing me originally, if they may be willing to testify, that according to the most rigid sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now for the hope of the promise which is from God to our fathers, I stand being judged:

7. unto which our twelve tribes constantly worshiping night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope I am accused by the Jews, O king.

8. Why is it judged by you incredible, if God shall raise the dead?

9. Moreover indeed, I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene:

10. which I did also in Jerusalem, and shut up many of the saints in prison; and having received authority from the chief priests, and they being slain, I gave my vote against them;

11. and throughout all the synagogues, frequently punishing them, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceeding mad against them, I was persecuting them even also unto foreign cities.

12. Meanwhile journeying to Damascus with power and authority of the chief priests, I saw on the way, O king,

13. about midday, a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me;

14. and we all having fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against goads.

15. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou art persecuting.

16. But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for unto this have I appeared unto thee, to make thee a minister and a martyr both of those things which thou hast seen, and of which I will appear unto thee;

17. delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,

18. to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, in order that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.

19. Therefore, O king, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:

20. but first to those in Damascus, and also in Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles, I was preaching that they should repent and turn to God, doing things worthy of repentance.

21. On account of these things the Jews, taking me while in the temple, endeavored to kill me.

22. Then having received help from God, I have stood unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said were about to come to pass:

23. how that Christ must suffer, how being the first from the resurrection of the dead, he is to proclaim light both to the people, and the Gentiles.

24. And he making his defence to these things, Festus says with a loud voice, O Paul, thou art beside thyself; many writings turned thee into insanity.

25. But Paul says, I am not a maniac, most noble Festus; but I speak forth the words of truth and soberness.

26. For the king, to whom I also speak boldly, knows concerning these things: for I am persuaded that nothing of these things is hidden; for this has not been done in a corner.

27. O king Agrippa, dost thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believest them.

28. And Agrippa said to Paul, With little persuasion thou dost persuade thyself to make me a Christian.

29. And Paul said, I would to God, that both in little and in much, not only you, but also all of those hearing me this day, were such as I am, except these bonds.

30. And the king, and the governor, and Bernice, and those sitting with them, arose up:

31. and having gone away, they were talking to one another, saying, that This man is doing nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

32. But Agrippa said to Festus, This man was able to have been released, if he had not appealed to Caesar. 

## Acts 27

1. And when it was determined that we should sail away into Italy, they committed both Paul and certain other prisoners to the centurion, Julius by name, of the band of Augustus.

2. And having embarked on an Adramyttium ship, about to sail to those places along Asia, we set sail; Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.

3. And on the following day we disembarked at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, permitted him having gone to his friends to receive their benefactions.

4. And having embarked from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary:

5. and having sailed through the sea which is opposite Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down into Myra of Lycia.

6. And there the centurion having found an Alexandrian ship sailing into Italy; transferred us into it.

7. And sailing slowly during many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not favoring us, we sailed under Crete, opposite Salmone;

8. and, with difficulty passing by it, we came into a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was the city Lasea.

9. And much time passing away, and navigation being already unsafe, because the Fast had already passed by, Paul exhorted them,

10. saying to them, Men, I perceive that this voyage is going to be with peril and much loss, not only with the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.

11. But the centurion trusted the pilot and midshipman, rather than the things spoken by Paul.

12. And the harbor being unsafe for spending the winter, most of them projected to the council to depart thence, if perchance they might be able, having arrived into Phoenix, to spend the winter there; a harbor of Crete, looking toward the southeast and the northeast.

13. And the south wind blowing, thinking they could achieve their purpose, lifting up a sail, they went coasting along near Crete.

14. Not long afterward a typhonic wind, called Euraquilo, set in against her;

15. and the ship having been seized, and being unable to resist the wind, having given away to it, we were borne along.

16. And running under a certain island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get possession of the boat:

17. which lifting up they used helps, under-girding the ship; and fearing lest they might fall into Syrtis, lowering the gear, they were thus carried along.

18. And we being tossed violently by the storm, they were successively making the casting out,

19. and on the third day with their own hands they threw overboard the tackling of the ship;

20. and neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and there being no small tempest on us, finally all hope of saving us was taken away.

21. And there being much fasting, Paul standing in their midst, said, O men, truly it behooved you obeying me, not to depart from Crete, and incur this injury and loss.

22. And now I exhort you to take courage: for there will be no loss of the life of you, except the ship.

23. For the angel of God, whose I am, and whom indeed I serve, stood by me this night,

24. saying, Fear not, Paul; for it behooveth thee to stand before Caesar: and, behold, God has given thee all those sailing along with thee.

25. Therefore cheer up, O men: for I believe God, that it shall be according to the manner which He has spoken to me.

26. But it behooves us to fall upon a certain island.

27. And when it was the fourteenth night, we being borne along in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors surmised that some country was coming to them.

28. And having sounded, they found it twenty fathoms; and moving on a short distance, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms;

29. and fearing lest they may fall out against rough places, casting four anchors from the stern, they were praying that the day should come.

30. And the sailors seeking to escape from the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, with a pretext as about to cast anchors from the prow,

31. Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these may remain in the ship, you are not able to be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut the ropes away from the boat, and let it fall out.

33. But until the day was about to come, Paul exhorted all to take food, saying, Already this day you remain in a state of solicitude, the fourteenth day, receiving nothing.

34. Therefore I exhort you to take food: for this is for your safety: for not a hair of your head shall perish.

35. And having spoken these words, and taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and breaking it, began to eat.

36. And all becoming cheerful, themselves also took food.

37. And we were two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship.

38. And having been revived by the food, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat over into the sea.

39. And when it was day, they did not recognize the land: but discovered a certain gulf having a shore, into which they determined, if possible, to thrust out the ship.

40. And having knocked off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders, and raising up the main sail to the blowing wind, they made for the shore.

41. And having fallen into a place where two seas met, they broke the ship, and indeed the prow, sticking fast, remained motionless, but the stern was torn off by the violence (of the wind).

42. And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest some one, having outswum them, might escape:

43. but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, forbade them from their counsel; and commanded that those who were able to swim, having first thrown themselves overboard, to go to the land;

44. and the rest, some on planks, and others on some parts from the ship. And thus it came to pass that all came safe to the land. 

## Acts 28

1. And having been saved, we recognized that the island is called Melita.

2. And the barbarians extended no small philanthropy to us: for, having kindled a fire, they received us all to it, on account of the recent rain and cold.

3. And Paul having gathered up a certain bundle of sticks, and placed it on the fire, a viper, having come out from the heat, fastened on his hand.

4. But when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Surely this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved from the sea, justice did not permit to live.

5. Then indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, he suffered no injury:

6. and they were looking for him to be about to swell up and suddenly fall down dead. But having looked a long time, and seeing nothing out of place come to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.

7. But in the regions around about that place there were farms belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius: who, having received us, entertained us courteously three days.

8. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius was lying prostrate with fevers and dysentery: to whom Paul having come in, and prayed, laying hands on him, healed him.

9. And this taking place, the rest also, on the island having diseases, continued to come to him, and be healed;

10. who also honored us with many honors; and conferred on us, departing, those things appertaining to use.

11. And after three months we embarked in an Alexandrian ship, having spent the winter in the island, dedicated to the sons of Jupiter.

12. And having disembarked into Syracuse, we remained three days;

13. thence having come circuitously, we arrived into Rhegium. And after one day there being a south wind, we came the second day to Puteoli,

14. where having found brethren, we were entreated to remain with them seven days: and thus we came into Rome.

15. And the brethren, hearing the news concerning us, came thence to meet us at the Appian Forum and Three Taverns: whom Paul, seeing, having given thanks to God, took courage.

16. And when we came into Rome, it was permitted to Paul to remain to himself with the soldier guarding him.

17. And it came to pass, after three days, he called together those who were first of the Jews; and they having assembled, he said to them, I, men, brethren, having done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, was committed a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans;

18. who judging me, were counseling to release me, because there was nothing worthy of death in me:

19. and the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not having anything for which to accuse my nation.

20. Then for this cause I have called you, to see you, and talk to you: for on account of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.

21. And they said to him, Neither have we received letters from Judea concerning you, neither has any one of the brethren coming, proclaimed or spoken anything evil concerning you.

22. But we desire to hear from you what you think: for indeed concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.

23. And having appointed a day with him, many came to him into his hired house, to whom witnessing he expounded the kingdom of God, indeed persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morning unto evening.

24. And some of them indeed believed the things spoken, but others continued to doubt;

25. and they being disharmonious to one another, dispersed, Paul saying one word, that truly the Holy Ghost spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, saying,

26. Go to this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and may not understand; and seeing you shall see, and may not perceive:

27. for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and they heard with their ears heavily, and closed their eyes; lest they may see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I shall heal them.

28. Therefore let it be known unto you, that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.

29. And he spent a whole biennium in his own hired house, and received all those coming to him,

30. preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus, with all boldness, uninterruptedly.
