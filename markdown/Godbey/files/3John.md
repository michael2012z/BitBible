# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1. The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I truly love with divine love.

2. Beloved, I pray that you may prosper concerning all things and be well, as your soul prospers.

3. I rejoice exceedingly, the brethren coming and witnessing to thy truth, as thou art walking about in truth.

4. I have no greater joy than this, that I may hear of my children walking about in truth.

5. Beloved, whatsoever faithful deed thou mayest do to the brethren, thou art also dispensing to the strangers,

6. who have witnessed to thy divine love before the church: whom you will do well, having sent forth worthily of God.

7. For the sake of his name they went out, receiving nothing from the Gentiles.

8. Therefore we ought to receive such, in order that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.

9. I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, loving the preeminence over them, does not receive us.

10. On account of this, if I may come, I will remember his works which he is doing, berating us with wicked speeches: and not content with these, he does not receive the brethren, and he prohibits them wishing to receive them, and casts them out of the church.

11. Beloved, imitate not the evil, but the good. The one doing good is of God: the one doing evil has not seen God.

12. To Demetrius it has been testified by all, and by the truth itself: and we also testify: and you know that our testimony is true.

13. Having many things to write to you, but I do not wish to write them to you with ink and paper:

14. but I hope to see you immediately, and mouth to mouth we will speak. Peace be unto you. The friends salute you; salute the friends by name.
