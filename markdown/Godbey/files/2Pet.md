# 2 Peter

## 2 Peter 1

1. Simon Peter, the servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those receiving like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.

2. Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the perfect knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Lord.

3. As His divine power having given unto us all things which appertain to life and godliness, through the perfect knowledge of the one having called us to his own glory and virtue:

4. through which precious and greatest promises have been given unto us; that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust.

5. And in harmony with this same thing also, add to your faith heroism; and to heroism, knowledge;

6. and to knowledge holiness; and to holiness patience; and patience, godliness;

7. and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness divine love.

8. For these things, being in you and overflowing, render you neither barren nor unfruitful in the perfect knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;

9. for he unto whom these things are not present is blind, not seeing afar off, having received the forgetfulness of his purgation from his old sins.

10. Therefore, brethren, be the more diligent to make your calling and election sure: for doing these things you can never fall.

11. For in this way an entrance will be administered unto you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

12. Therefore I will be about to always remind you concerning these things, even though knowing them, and being established in the present truth.

13. But I consider it righteous, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by remembrance;

14. knowing that the laying aside of my tabernacle is swift, as our Lord Jesus Christ also showed to me.

15. And I will endeavor to have each one of you after my departure make mention of these things.

16. For not having followed cunningly devised fables, have we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but having been eyewitnesses of his majesty.

17. For having received from God the Father the honor and glory of such a voice having been borne to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

18. We, being with him in the holy mount, heard this voice borne from heaven.

19. And we have the more certain word of prophecy; to which you do well giving heed, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day may dawn, and the morning-star may rise in your hearts:

20. know this in the first place, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.

21. For in the olden time prophecy did not come by the will of man: but men moved by the Holy Ghost spoke from God. 

## 2 Peter 2

1. However there were indeed false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you, whosoever shall bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.

2. And many will follow their impurities; through whom the way of truth will be slandered:

3. and in their covetousness they will sell you with their soft speeches: unto whom judgment from olden time tarries not, and their destruction does not slumber.

4. For if God spared not the angels who sinned, but having sent them down to hell, committed them to chains of darkness to be kept unto judgment;

5. and spared not the old world, but delivered Noah the eighth person, the preacher of righteousness, brings the flood upon the world of the ungodly;

6. and having destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, with a catastrophe he condemned them, having put them forth as an example to those about to be ungodly:

7. and he delivered righteous Lot, being grieved by the deportment of the ungodly in their debauchery:

8. (for the righteous man dwelling among them, by seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds:)

9. for the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations, and to keep the unrighteous unto the day of judgment enduring punishment:

10. and especially those going after the flesh in the lust of pollution, and despising lordship. Audacious darers, blaspheming, they do not tremble at glories;

11. where the angels, being greater in strength and power, do not bring a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.

12. But these, like irrational animals having been born naturally for capture and destruction, blaspheming those things in which they are ignorant; in their own corruption they will indeed corrupt themselves;

13. receiving the reward of unrighteousness, esteeming pleasure which is in the daytime; luxury; spots and blemishes, swelling in their deceits, feasting along with you,

14. having eyes full of an adulteress, and unable to cease from sin; beguiling unestablished souls: having a heart which has been made fat with covetousness; children of the curse:

15. leaving the straight way, they have wandered off, following in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the reward of iniquity; and had the conviction of his own conscience:

16. the dumb workbeast having spoken with the voice of a man, rebuked the madness of the prophet.

17. These are fountains without water, and mists driven away by the storm, for which the blackness of darkness has been reserved.

18. For speaking swelling words of vanity, in the lusts of the flesh they beguile with their impurities, those that have but partially escaped, who are still moving about in their delusion;

19. promising them liberty, they themselves being the slaves of corruption: for to whatsoever any one has been subordinated, to this he has become enslaved.

20. For if having escaped the pollutions of the world through the perfect knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and having again become entangled in these things, they are overcome, the last state has to them become worse than the first.

21. For it was better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment which has been delivered unto them.

22. It has happened unto them according to the old proverb, The dog having returned to his own vomit; and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire. 

## 2 Peter 3

1. I indeed, beloved, write unto you this second epistle; in which I stir up your pure mind by remembrance:

2. to remember the words which have been spoken hitherto by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour by your apostles:

3. knowing this first, that at the last days mockers will come forth in scoffing, walking according to their own lusts,

4. and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for from the day when the fathers fell asleep, all things remain as from the beginning of creation.

5. For they willingly forget this, that the heavens were in the olden time, and the earth standing out of the water and through the water, by the word of God;

6. by which the world at that time, being flooded with water, perished:

7. but now the heavens and the earth have been kept according to the same word, being reserved for fire in the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people.

8. But let not this one thing be forgotten, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

9. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some people count slackness; but is long-suffering for your sakes, not wishing that any should perish, but all come to repentance.

10. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements being scorched up will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burnt up.

11. Then all these things being dissolved, what kind of people does it behoove you to be in holy deportment and godliness,

12. looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements being scorched up are melted?

13. But, according to his promises, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, wherein righteousness dwells.

14. Therefore, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent to be found spotless and blameless unto him in peace:

15. and consider the longsuffering of the Lord's salvation; as our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom which was given unto him has written unto you;

16. as also in all his epistles, speaking in the same concerning these things; in which there are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unestablished wrest, as they also do the other scriptures, to their own destruction.

17. Then you, beloved, foreknowing watch, lest, having been led away by the delusion of the ungodly, you may fall from your own stedfastness:

18. but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of the age.
