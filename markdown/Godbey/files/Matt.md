# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

2. Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers;

3. And Judah begat Phares and Zara from Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

4. and Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;

5. and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;

6. and Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her who was the wife of Uriah;

7. and Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;

8. and Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; Joram begat Hozias;

9. Hozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; Achaz begat Hezekiah;

10. and Hezekiah begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;

11. and Josiah begat Jechonias and his brothers in the captivity of Babylon.

12. And after the captivity of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorababbel;

13. Zorababbel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;

14. and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Acheim; Acheim begat Eliud;

15. and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;

16. and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, from whom Jesus, who is called Christ, was born.

17. Therefore all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; from David unto the captivity of Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the captivity of Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

18. The birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother Mary, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, was found having gestation from the Holy Ghost.

19. And Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wishing to expose her publicly, determined to send her away secretly.

20. And he meditating on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying; Joseph, son of David, do not fear to receive Mary thy wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit;

21. she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He will save His people from their sins.

22. And all this took place in order that the Word, having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying;

23. Behold, the virgin shall have gestation and bring forth a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted, God is with us.

24. And Joseph rising from sleep did as the angel of the Lord commanded him;

25. and he took his wife to himself, and did not know her until she brought forth a son, and called his name Jesus. 

## Matthew 2

1. Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came into Jerusalem saying;

2. Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and have come to worship Him-

3. And Herod the king having heard, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him,

4. and gathering together all the chief priests and scribes, inquired with them where Christ should be born.

5. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it has been written by the prophet;

6. And thou, Bethlehem, the land of Judea, art by no means the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come a leader, who will shepherd my people, Israel.

7. Then Herod secretly calling the wise men, inquired with them the time of the appearing of the star,

8. and sending them to Bethlehem he said; Having gone search diligently for the young child; and when you may find Him, notify me, in order that I, having gone, may worship Him also.

9. And hearing the king they departed, and, behold, the star which they saw in the east went before them, until having come, it stood above where the young child was.

10. And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

11. And having come into the house they saw the young child with Mary His mother, and having fallen down they worshiped Him, and opening their treasures they offered Him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.

13. And they having gone away, behold, the angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying; Having arisen, take the young child and His mother, and fly into Egypt; and be thou there until I may speak to thee; for Herod is about to seek the young child in order to destroy Him.

14. And having arisen, he took with him the young child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt;

15. and was there until the death of Herod: in order that the Word, having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying; Out of Egypt have I called my son.

16. Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked by the wise men, became exceedingly angry; and having sent forth, he slew all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its boundaries, from two years old and under, according to the time which he inquired with the wise men.

17. Then the word having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying:

18. A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and weeping and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children; and was not willing to be comforted, because they are not.

19. And Herod having died, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in Egypt in a dream, saying;

20. Having arisen, take with you the young child and His mother, and depart into the land of Israel; for those seeking the life of the young child are dead.

21. And having arisen he took with him the young child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.

22. And having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to depart thither; and being warned in a dream he departed into the regions of Galilee.

23. And having come, he went down into the city called Nazareth, in order that the words spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that He shall be called a Nazarene. 

## Matthew 3

1. In those days comes John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,

2. saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.

3. This is the one, who is spoken of by Isaiah the prophet saying, The voice of one roaring in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.

4. And the same John had his raiment from camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region about the Jordan, were coming out to him,

6. and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them; O generations of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance;

9. and think not to say among yourselves; We have Abraham, our father; for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

10. But already the ax is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.

11. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but there is One coming after me more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.

12. Whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purify His threshing-floor, and gather His wheat into the garner, and will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

13. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, in order to be baptized by him.

14. And John continued to forbid Him saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou unto me?

15. And Jesus responding said to him; Suffer it now; for thus it is becoming us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers Him.

16. And Jesus having been baptized, came up straightway from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened and He saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove, coming on Him.

17. And behold, a voice from the heavens, saying; This is my beloved Son in whom I delight. 

## Matthew 4

1. Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.

2. And having fasted forty days and forty nights, He afterward hungered.

3. And the tempter having come to Him, said; If thou art the Son of God, speak in order that these stones may become bread.

4. And He responding said; It has been written, A man shall not live upon bread alone, but upon every word coming forth through the mouth of God.

5. Then the devil takes Him into the holy city and stood Him on the pinnacle of the temple,

6. and says to Him; If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it has been written, That He will give His angels charge concerning thee, and upon their hand they will bear thee, lest thou mayest dash thy foot against a stone.

7. Jesus said to him; Again it has been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

8. Again the devil takes Him into an exceedingly high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of the same,

9. and said to Him; All these things will I give unto thee,

10. If having fallen down thou mayest worship me: then Jesus says to him, Get behind me, Satan; for it has been written; Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.

11. Then the devil leaveth Him; and behold, the angels came to Him and continued to minister unto Him.

12. And Jesus having heard that John was cast into prison, departed into Galilee.

13. And having left Nazareth, having come into Capernaum, by the seaside, in the borders of Zabulon and Naphtali, He dwelt there;

14. in order that the word having been spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,

15. Thou land Zabulon and land Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,

16. the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the valley and shadow of death, light sprang up.

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of the heavens draweth nigh.

18. And He walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting their net into the sea; for they were fishers.

19. And He says to them, Follow after me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And immediately, having left their nets, they followed Him.

21. And going forth from thence, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.

22. And immediately having left the ship and their father, they followed Him.

23. And Jesus was going round all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every malady among the people.

24. And His fame went forth into all Syria: and they brought Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, and the demonized, and the lunatics, and the paralytics; and He healed them.

25. And many multitudes followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan. 

## Matthew 5

1. And seeing the multitudes, He went up into the mountain; and having sat down, His disciples came to Him.

2. And having opened His mouth He taught them, saying;

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit: because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.

4. Blessed are the meek, because they shall inherit the earth.

5. Blessed are they that mourn: because they shall be comforted.

6. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: because they shall be filled.

7. Blessed are the merciful: because they shall receive mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart: because they shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peacemakers: because they shall be called the sons of God.

10. Blessed are they, who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.

11. Blessed are ye when they may despise you, and shall persecute you, and may say all evil against you, falsifying, for my sake.

12. Rejoice, and he exceedingly glad: because your reward is great in the heavens: for in this manner they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

13. Ye are the salt of the earth; and if the salt may lose its savor, in what shall it be salted? It is yet without value, except having been cast out, to be trodden under feet by the people.

14. Ye are the light of the world. A city sitting on a mountain is unable to be hidden.

15. Neither do they light a candle, and place it under a bushel, but on the candlestick; and it shineth to all who are in the house.

16. Let your light so shine before the people, in order that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.

17. Think not that I came to destroy the law of the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.

18. For truly I say unto you, Until heaven and earth may pass away, one jot or tittle can not pass from the law, until all things may be accomplished.

19. Therefore if any one may break one of the least of these commandments, and so teach the people, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens: but whosoever may do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.

20. For I say unto you, that if your righteousness may not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you can not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

21. You have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not murder; and whosoever may murder shall be in danger of the judgment;

22. but I say unto you that every one being angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever may say to his brother, Thou scoundrel, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever may say, Thou fool, shall be liable unto a hell of fire.

23. Therefore if you may bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,

24. leave there your gift before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to your brother, then having come offer your gift.

25. Be reconciled with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; lest the adversary may deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you may be cast into prison.

26. Truly I say unto you, You can not go out from thence until you have paid the last farthing.

27. You have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.

28. But I say unto you that every one looking on a woman in order to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not that thy whole body may go away into hell.

30. And it was said, Whosoever may send away his wife, let him give her a divorcement.

31. But I say unto you, that every one sending away his wife, except on account of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever may marry her who has been cast off commits adultery.

32. Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shall perform unto the Lord thine oaths.

33. But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;

34. nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; neither by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.

35. Neither swear by thy head, because thou art unable to make one hair white or black.

36. But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but that which aboundeth more than these is of the evil one.

37. You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

38. But I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smites thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also:

39. to him wishing to prosecute thee at law, and take away thy coat, let him have the cloak also.

40. Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two.

41. Give to the one asking thee, and do not turn away from the one wishing to borrow from thee.

42. You have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.

43. But I say unto you, Love your enemies with a divine love, bless those who curse you and pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you:

44. in order that you may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens: because He raises up His sun on the wicked and on the good, and rains on the righteous and on the unrighteous.

45. For if you love those that love you, what reward have ye? because the publicans also do the same.

46. If you salute your brethren only, what do ye more abundantly? do not the heathens also the same thing?

47. Therefore ye shall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect. 

## Matthew 6

1. But take heed that you do not your righteousness before the people, in order to be seen by them: else you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens:

2. therefore when you may do alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be glorified by the people: truly I say unto you, They exhaust their reward.

3. But thou doing alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:

4. in order that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee openly.

5. And when you pray, be not like the hypocrites: because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, in order that they may appear unto the people. Truly I say unto you, They exhaust their reward.

6. But when thou mayest pray, enter into thy closet, and having closed thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will reward thee openly.

7. And praying do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do: for they think they shall be heard in their much speaking.

8. Therefore be not like unto them: for your Father knows of what things you have need, before you ask him.

9. Therefore pray ye after this manner: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be hallowed:

10. let thy kingdom come: let thy will be done, as in heaven, even so upon earth:

11. give us this day our daily bread:

12. and forgive us our debts, as we have also forgiven our debtors:

13. lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

14. For if you may not forgive the people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will not forgive you:

15. and if you do not forgive the people, your Father will not forgive you your trespasses.

16. And when you may fast, be not like the hypocrites, of a sad contenance: for they disfigure their faces, in order that they may appear unto the people fasting. Truly I say unto you, They exhaust their reward.

17. But thou, fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;

18. in order that thou mayest not appear unto the people fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.

19. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and thieves break through and steal:

20. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not corrupt, and thieves do not break through and steal:

21. for where your treasure is, there will be your heart also.

22. For the light of the body is the eye. If thine eye may be clear, thy whole body will he lighted.

23. If thine eye may be bad, thy whole body will be dark. Then if the light which is in you is darkness, the darkness is so great.

24. No one is able to serve two masters: for he will hate the one, and love the other; or cleave to the one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon.

25. Therefore I say unto you, Be not solicitous for your soul what you may eat, nor for your body what you may put on. Is not your soul more valuable than food, and your body than raiment?

26. Look unto the fowls of heaven, how they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are you not more excellent than they?

27. And which one of you being solicitous is able to add one moment to his existence?

28. And why are you solicitous concerning raiment? Know the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.

29. But I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these.

30. But if God so clothed the verdure of the field, existing today and tomorrow cast into the oven, how much more you, O ye of little faith?

31. Therefore be not solicitous, saying, What can we eat? or what can we drink? or with what can we be clothed?

32. For after all these things the heathen were seeking; for your heavenly Father knoweth that you need all these things.

33. But seek first the kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

34. Therefore be not solicitous unto the morrow: for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 

## Matthew 7

1. Criticise not, that you may not be criticised.

2. For with what criticism you criticise, you will be criticised: and with what measure you measure, it will be measured unto you.

3. But why do you see the mote which is in the eye of your brother, and do not recognize the beam which is in your own eye?

4. Or how will you say to your brother, Permit me, I will cast out the mote from your eye; and behold, there is a beam in your own eye?

5. O hypocrite, first cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote from the eye of your brother.

6. Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest they may trample them under their feet, and having turned round tear you to pieces.

7. Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

8. For every one asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened.

9. What man is there of you, whom, if his son shall ask bread, he will give him a stone?

10. And if he may ask a fish, whether will he give him a serpent?

11. Therefore if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask Him?

12. Therefore all things whatsoever you may wish that the people may do unto you, do ye even so unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.

13. Enter ye in through the narrow gate: because wide is the gate and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there are, who are going in through it.

14. Because narrow is the gate, and contracted the way, that leadeth into life, and few there are who find it.

15. But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are rapacious wolves.

16. You shall know them by their fruits. Do the people gather the grape-bunches from thorns, or figs from thistles?

17. So every good tree produces good fruits; and a corrupt tree produces evil fruits.

18. A good tree is not able to produce evil fruits, neither is a corrupt tree able to produce beautiful fruits.

19. Every tree not producing beautiful fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.

20. Therefore you shall know them perfectly by their fruits.

21. Not every one saying to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in the heavens.

22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name done many mighty works?

23. Then I will confess unto them that I never knew you: depart from me, ye who work iniquity.

24. Then every one who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock.

25. And the rain came down, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and fell against that house; and it did not fall; for it was founded upon the rock.

26. And every one hearing these words of mine, and doing them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.

27. And the rain came down, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat against that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

28. And it came to pass when Jesus finished these discourses, the multitudes were astonished at His teaching:

29. for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. 

## Matthew 8

1. And many multitudes followed Him, coming down from the mountain.

2. And behold, a leper, having come, continued to worship Him, saying; Lord, if you may be willing, you are able to cleanse me.

3. And Jesus, reaching forth His hand, touched him, saying, I am willing; be thou cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus says to him, See that you may tell no one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

5. And He having come into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, entreating Him,

6. and saying; Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, terribly tormented.

7. And Jesus says to him, Having come I will heal him.

8. And the centurion responding said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou mayest come in under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant will be healed.

9. For I am also a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

10. And Jesus hearing, was astonished, and said to those following, Truly I say unto you, I did not find so great faith in Israel.

11. And I say unto you, that many will come from the east and from the west, and sit up with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens:

12. but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go; and let it be done unto thee as thou hast believed. And his servant was healed at that hour.

14. And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law prostrated and burning with fever.

15. And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and began to minister unto them.

16. And it being evening, they brought to Him many demonized people: and He cast out the demons by His word, and healed all the sick;

17. in order that the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, He took our infirmities, and carried our sicknesses.

18. And Jesus seeing the multitudes about Him, gave command to go away to the other side.

19. And one scribe having come, said to Him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go.

20. And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven nests; but the Son of man has not where He may recline His head.

21. And another of His disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go away and bury my father.

22. And Jesus says to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.

23. And His disciples followed Him, having come into the ship.

24. And behold, there was a great storm on the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: and He was asleep.

25. And the disciples having come, awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us; we are perishing.

26. And He says to them, Why are you afraid, O ye of little faith? Then having arisen, He rebuked the wind and the sea; and there was a great calm.

27. And the men were astonished, saying, What sort of a man is this, because winds and the sea obey him?

28. Two demoniacs met Him, having come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, coming out from the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one was able to pass through that way.

29. And behold, they cried out, saying, What is there to us and thee, O Son of God? have you come hither to torment us before the time?

30. And a herd of many swine was feeding a great way from them.

31. And the demons continued to intreat him, saying, If you cast us out, permit us to depart into the herd of swine.

32. And He said to them, Go. And they having gone out, went away into the herd of swine; and the whole herd rushed down the precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.

33. And the herders fled, and having gone away into the city, proclaimed all things, and those appertaining to the demonized.

34. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and seeing Him, intreated Him, that He should depart from their coasts. 

## Matthew 9

1. And having embarked into the ship, He crossed over, and came into His own city.

2. And behold, they were bringing to Him a paralyzed man, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Be of good cheer, child, thy sins are forgiven thee.

3. And behold, certain ones of the scribes said among themselves; This man blasphemeth.

4. And Jesus seeing their thoughts said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?

5. For whether is it easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or, Arise, and walk about?

6. But in order that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then He says to the paralytic), Having arisen, take thy bed, and depart into thy house.

7. And having arisen, he came away to his own house.

8. And the multitude seeing, were astonished, and glorified God, who giveth such power to men.

9. And Jesus passing along from thence, saw a man sitting at the toll, called Matthew; and He says to him, Follow me. And having arisen up, he followed Him.

10. And it came to pass, He was sitting at the table in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners, having come were sitting along with Jesus and His disciples.

11. And the Pharisees seeing, said to His disciples, Wherefore does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?

12. And Jesus hearing said to them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.

13. But having gone, learned what this is, I wish mercy and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

14. Then the disciples of John come to Him, saying, Wherefore do we and the Pharisee fast, but thy disciples do not fast?

15. And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bride-chamber are not able to fast, so long as the bridegroom is with them. But the day will come, when the bride-groom must be taken from them, and then they will fast.

16. But no one puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment; for it takes its fullness from the garment, and the rent is made worse.

17. Neither do they put new wine in old bottles: lest the bottles are broken, and the wine poured out, and the bottles shall perish: but they put the new wine into the new bottles, and both are preserved.

18. And He speaking these things to them, behold a certain ruler having come, continued to worship Him, saying, My daughter just now died: but having come put your hand on her, and she shall live.

19. And Jesus having risen, follows him, and His disciples.

20. And behold, a woman, having an issue of blood twelve years, and coming to Him behind, touched the hem of His garment.

21. For she continued to say within herself, If I may only touch His garment, I will be saved.

22. And the woman was saved from that hour. And Jesus turning and seeing her said, Be of good cheer, daughter; thy faith hath saved thee.

23. And Jesus having come into the house of the ruler, and seeing the flute-players, and the weeping crowd,

24. says to them; Retire: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they hooted at Him.

25. And when the crowd was put out, coming to her, He took her by the hand, and the damsel arose.

26. And this news went out into that whole country.

27. And two blind men followed Him, going thence, crying out, and saying,

28. Have mercy on us, thou Son of David. And the blind men came to Him, having come into the house: and Jesus says to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They say to Him, Yea, Lord.

29. Then He touched their eyes, saying, Be it unto you according to your faith.

30. And their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them, saying, See that no one know it.

31. But they having gone out, spread abroad His fame in all that country.

32. And they going out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man, demonized.

33. And the demon having been cast out, the dumb spoke. And the multitudes were astonished, saying,

34. Never did it so appear in Israel. And the Pharisees continued to say, He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons.

35. And Jesus was going around all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and ailment.

36. And seeing the multitudes, He was moved in compassion in their behalf, because they were fleeced and deserted, as sheep having no shepherd.

37. Then He says to His disciples, The harvest truly is great and the laborers are few;

38. therefore pray the Lord of the harvest that he may send forth laborers into His harvest. 

## Matthew 10

1. And calling His twelve disciples, He gave them power over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out, and heal every disease, and every malady.

2. And these are the names of the apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus called Thaddeus;

4. Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, the one also having betrayed Him.

5. And Jesus sent out the twelve, commanding them, Go not in the way of the Gentiles, and enter not into a city of the Samaritans.

6. But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And going, preach, saying, That the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.

8. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely you did receive, freely give.

9. Take not gold, nor silver, nor copper in your girdles;

10. nor valise for your journey, neither two coats, nor sandals, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.

11. And into whatsoever city or village you may enter, investigate who in it is worthy; and there abide until you may go hence.

12. And going into a house, salute it.

13. And if the house may be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it may be unworthy, let your peace return unto you.

14. And whosoever may not receive you, nor hear your words, going out from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

15. Truly I say unto you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

16. Behold, I send you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

17. Beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the sanhedrins, and will beat you in their synagogues;

18. and they will lead you before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them and the Gentiles.

19. And when they may deliver you, be not solicitous how or what you may speak: for it will be given unto you in that hour what you may say.

20. For you are not those speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is speaking in you.

21. And brother will deliver brother unto death, and the father the child: and children will rise up against parents, and put them to death.

22. And you will be hated by all on account of my name: but he that persevereth unto the end, the same shall be saved.

23. And when they may persecute you in this city, fly to another: for truly I say unto you, You may not complete the cities of Israel, until the Son of man may come.

24. The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord.

25. It is sufficient for the disciple that he may be as his teacher, and the servant, as his lord: if they call the landlord Beelzebul, how much more the inmates of his house?

26. Therefore fear them not; for there is nothing hidden, that shall not be revealed; nothing secret, that shall not be known.

27. What I say unto you in the darkness, speak ye in the light: and whatsoever you hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

28. Be not afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but fear ye, rather him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and one of them will not fall to the ground without your Father.

30. But the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Then fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.

32. Therefore every one who shall confess me before the people, I will also confess him before my Father, who is in the heavens.

33. But whosoever may deny me before the people, I will also deny him before my Father who is in the heavens.

34. Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

35. For I came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:

36. and the enemies of a man will be the inmates of his own house.

37. He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

38. Whosoever does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.

39. The one having found his soul shall lose it; and the one losing his soul for my sake shall find it.

40. The one receiving you will receive me, and the one receiving me will receive Him that sent me.

41. The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive the reward of a prophet; and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive the reward of a righteous man.

42. And whosoever may give one of these little ones only a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple, truly I say unto you, He can not lose his reward. 

## Matthew 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus finished teaching His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.

2. And John hearing in the prison the works of Christ, sending two of his disciples,

3. said to Him, Art thou He who is coming, or must we expect another?

4. Jesus responding said to them, Having gone, proclaim unto John the things which you hear and see.

5. The blind are looking up, and the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed, and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the poor are having the gospel preached unto them:

6. and blessed is he, whosoever may not be offended in me.

7. And they departing, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out in the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?

8. But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold those wearing soft raiment are in the houses of the kings.

9. But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet:

10. for this is he, concerning whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before my face, who will prepare thy way before thee.

11. Truly I say unto you, Among those having been born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: nevertheless the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.

12. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence, and the violent are taking it by force.

13. For all the prophets and the law prophesied till John.

14. And if you wish to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come.

15. Let the one having ears to hear, hear.

16. But to whom shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-place, and calling to their comrades, and saying,

17. We piped unto you, and you did not dance; we mourned unto you, and you did not lament.

18. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.

19. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous and wine-drinking man, a friend of publicans and sinners. Wisdom is truly justified by her children.

20. Then He began to upbraid the cities in which the most mighty works of His were performed, because they did not repent.

21. Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! because if the mighty works which were wrought in you had been in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. Moreover I say unto you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.

23. And thou, Capernaum, art thou not exalted up to heaven? thou shall be cast down to Hades: because if the mighty works which were wrought in thee had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

24. Moreover I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

25. At that time Jesus responding said, I praise thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and the prudent, and reveal them unto babes.

26. Yea, Father, because it was so well pleasing in thy sight.

27. All things were delivered unto me by my Father: and no one perfectly knows the Son, except the Father; neither does any one perfectly know the Father, except the Son; and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him.

28. Come unto me, all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; because I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest unto your souls.

30. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. 

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the cornfields; and His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears, and eat.

2. And the Pharisees, seeing, said to Him, Behold thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.

3. And He said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those with him?

4. How he came into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor those with him, except the priests only?

5. Have you not read in the law, that the priests in the temple do profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?

6. But I say unto you, that there is One here greater than the temple.

7. But if ye had known what this is, I wish mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent.

8. For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.

9. And having passed on thence, He came into their synagogue.

10. And behold, there was a man having a withered hand. And they asked Him saying, Whether is it lawful to heal on Sabbath? that they might accuse Him.

11. And He said to them; What man shall there he of you, who shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not lay hold of it and lift it up?

12. Therefore how much more valuable is a man than a sheep? So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.

13. Then He says to the man, Reach forth thy hand. And he reached it forth and it was restored.

14. And the Pharisees, having gone out, took counsel against I Him that they might destroy Him.

15. And Jesus having known it departed thence: and many multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.

16. And He charged them much that they should not make Him known.

17. In order that the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,

18. Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul took delight: I will place my Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim judgment to the Gentiles.

19. He will not strive, nor scream, nor shall any one hear His voice in the streets.

20. The bruised reed He will not break, and He will not quench the smoking wick, until He may send forth judgment unto victory.

21. And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.

22. Then a demonized man was brought to Him, blind and dumb: and He healed him, so that the blind and dumb man both spake and saw.

23. And all the multitudes were astonished, and continued to say, Is not this the son of David?

24. And the Pharisees hearing, said, This man casts not out demons, except through Beelzebul the prince of the demons.

25. And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.

26. And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?

27. lf I through Beelzebul cast out demons, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.

28. But if I through the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.

29. Or how is any one able to enter into the house of a strong man, and spoil his goods, unless he may first bind the strong man, and then he can spoil his house.

30. And the one not being with me is against me; and the one not gathering with me scatters abroad.

31. Therefore I say unto you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.

32. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven unto him: but whosoever may speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven unto him, either in this age, or that which is to come.

33. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by the fruit.

34. O ye generations of vipers, how are you, being evil, able to speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

35. The good man, out of the good treasure (heart) brings forth good things: and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure (heart) brings forth wicked things.

36. And I say unto you, that every idle word whatsoever men shall speak, they shall give an account concerning the same in the day of judgment.

37. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shah be condemned.

38. Then certain ones of the scribes and Pharisees responded, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from Thee.

39. He responding, said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given unto it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

40. For as Jonah was in the stomach of the whale three days and three nights, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.

41. The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

42. The queen of the south will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a greater than Solomon is here.

43. And when the unclean spirit may go out from the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.

44. Then he says, I will return to my own house whence I came out; and having come, he finds it empty, swept, and beautified.

45. Then he goes, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and having come in dwells there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So it will also be with this wicked generation.

46. And He yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and His brothers stood without, seeking to speak to Him.

47. And a certain one said to Him; Behold, thy mother and thy brothers stand without, seeking to speak to thee.

48. And He responding said to the one speaking to Him; Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?

49. And reaching forth His hand to His disciples, He said, Behold my mother and my brothers!

50. For whosoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, the same is my brother, and my sister, and my mother. 

## Matthew 13

1. On that day Jesus having come out from the house, was sitting by the sea:

2. and many multitudes were gathered unto Him, so that having gone into a ship, He sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

3. And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold a sower went out to sow.

4. And while he was sowing, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and ate them up.

5. And others fell among stones, where they had not much earth: and sprang up immediately, because they had no depth of earth:

6. and the sun having risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

7. But others fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them.

8. But others fell in good ground, and gave fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.

9. Let him that hath ears to hear, hear.

10. And His disciples coming, said to Him; Wherefore do you speak to them in parables?

11. He responding said to them, Because it has been given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.

12. But whosoever has, it shall be given to him, and he shall have more abundantly: but whosoever has not, it shall be taken from him even what he has.

13. Therefore I speak to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

14. And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled unto them, saying, By hearing ye shall hear, and may not understand; and seeing you shall see, and may not perceive.

15. Because the heart of this people is waxed gross, and they heard heavily with their ears, and closed their eyes; lest they may see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I shall heal them.

16. But happy are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.

17. Truly I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see those things which you see, and saw them not; and to hear those things which you hear, and heard them not.

18. Therefore hear ye the parable of the sower.

19. Every one hearing the word of the kingdom, and not understanding it, the wicked one comes, and seizes away that which is sown in his heart: he is the one sown by the wayside.

20. But the one sown upon the rocks, is he who heareth the word, and immediately with joy receives it;

21. but it has no root in him, but is temporary; and tribulation or persecution arising on account of the word, immediately he is offended.

22. But the one sown among the thorns, is he who heareth the word; and the care of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke out the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

23. And the one having been sown on good ground, is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who truly bears fruit, and produces, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.

24. He put forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man sowing good seed in his field.

25. And while the men slept, an enemy came, and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and departed.

26. And when the blades sprang up, and produced fruit, then the tares were also made manifest.

27. And the servants of the landlord having come to him said, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? whence then hath it tares?

28. And he said to them, A hostile man did this. And the servants say to him, Then do you wish that we, having gone, may gather them?

29. And he says, No; lest gathering the tares together you may at the same time along with them root up the wheat.

30. Let both grow together till the harvest: and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, First gather the tares, and bind them in bundles, in order to burn them: and gather the wheat into my barn.

31. And He submitted another parable to them, saying; The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which, a man having taken, sowed in his field;

32. which indeed is the smallest of all seeds; and when it grows up, is the greatest of herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven indeed lodge in its branches.

33. And he spake another parable unto them; The kingdom of the heavens is like unto the leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.

34. Jesus spoke all of these things to the multitudes in parables; and without a parable He was not speaking to them:

35. in order that the word spoken by Isaiah, the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables: I will make known the things which have been hidden from the foundation.

36. Then leaving the multitudes, He came into the house: and His disciples came to Him saying; Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.

37. And He responding said, The one sowing the good seed is the Son of man;

38. and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the wicked one,

39. and the enemy sowing them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are the angels.

40. Then as the tares are gathered and burnt up with fire; so it will be in the end of the age.

41. The Son of man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity,

42. and will cast them into the furnace of the fire: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then the righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. But let the one having ears, hear.

44. The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a treasure having been hidden in a field; which a man having found, concealed; and from his joy he goes and sells all things so many as he has, and buys that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man seeking beautiful pearls:

46. and having found one pearl of great price, having gone away he sold all things, so many as he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net cast into the sea, and gathering of every kind;

48. which, when it was filled, drawing up on the shore, and sitting down, they gathered the good into baskets, and threw the bad away.

49. So it will be in the end of the age: the angels will go forth, and will separate the wicked from the midst of the righteous,

50. and will cast them into the furnace of the fire: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

51. Do you understand all these things? They say to Him, Yea.

52. And He said to them, Therefore every scribe having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man who is a landlord, who bringeth out of his treasure things both new and old.

53. And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, He departed thence.

54. And having come into His own country He was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence this wisdom and these miracles unto Him?

55. Is not He the son of the carpenter? is not His mother called Mary? are not His brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

56. And are not His sisters all here with us? Whence then are these things to Him?

57. And they were offended in Him. And Jesus said to them; A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.

58. And He did not many mighty works there on account of their unbelief. 

## Matthew 14

1. And at that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus,

2. and he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore miracles are wrought in him.

3. For Herod having arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison, on account of Herodias the wife of his brother Philip.

4. For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

5. And wishing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because they esteemed him as a prophet.

6. Herod's birthday being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod;

7. consequently with an oath he promised to give to her whatsoever she might ask.

8. And being instigated by her mother, she says, Give me the head of John the Baptist here in a charger.

9. And the king was grieved; nevertheless on account of his oaths, and those who were sitting with him, he commanded it to be given.

10. And sending, he beheaded John in prison;

11. and his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

12. And His disciples, having come, took the body, and buried it; and having come they proclaimed it to Jesus.

13. And Jesus hearing, departed thence in a ship privately into a desert place. And the multitudes hearing, followed Him on foot from the cities.

14. And Jesus having come out saw a great multitude; and was moved with compassion in their behalf, and healed their sick.

15. And it being evening, His disciples came to Him saying, It is a desert place, and the hour is already advanced; therefore send away the multitudes, that they having gone into the villages, may purchase for themselves victuals.

16. And Jesus said to them, They have no need to go away; you give them to eat.

17. And they say to Him, We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes.

18. And He said, Bring them hither to me.

19. And commanding the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, He blessed them; and breaking, gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.

20. And all ate, and were filled: and they took up the remainder of the fragments twelve baskets full.

21. And the men eating were about five thousand, besides women and children.

22. And Jesus immediately constrained His disciples to embark into the ship and go before Him to the other side, until he can send away the multitudes.

23. And having dismissed the multitudes He went up into the mountain alone, to pray. And it being evening He was there alone.

24. And the ship was already midsea, laboring by the waves; for the wind was contrary.

25. And at the fourth watch of the night, He came to them, walking on the sea.

26. And the disciples seeing Him walking on the sea, were afrighted, saying, It is a specter; and they cried out from fear.

27. And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; I am here; fear not.

28. And Peter responding said, Lord, if thou art there, command me to come to thee on the waters.

29. And He said, Come. And Peter having come down from the ship, walked on the waters, and came toward Jesus.

30. And seeing the wind strong, became alarmed; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.

31. And Jesus immediately reaching out His hand, received him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

32. And they having come into the ship, the wind ceased.

33. And those in the ship having come worshiped Him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.

34. And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.

35. And the men of that place recognizing Him, sent into all the surrounding country and brought to Him all the sick;

36. and they continued to intreat Him that they should only touch the hem of His garment: and so many as touched were thoroughly saved. 

## Matthew 15

1. Then the scribes and Pharisees, who are from Jerusalem, come to Jesus, saying,

2. Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the traditions of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.

3. And responding He said to them; Wherefore do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?

4. For God commanded saying, Honor thy father and mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die with death.

5. But you say, Whosoever may say to father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever you may be profited by me; and he shall no longer honor his father or his mother.

6. You made void the commandment of God by your tradition.

7. Ye hypocrites, beautifully did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying,

8. This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

9. But in vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.

10. And calling the multitude to Him, He said to them, Hear and understand:

11. That if which cometh into the mouth does not defile the man; but that which cometh out from the mouth, that defiles the man.

12. Then His disciples having come to Him say, Do you not know that the Pharisees hearing your word, were offended?

13. And He responding said, Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant, shall be rooted up.

14. Let them alone: the blind are leaders of the blind: if the blind may lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.

15. Peter responding said to Him, Explain unto us the parable.

16. And Jesus said, Are you indeed still without understanding?

17. Do you know that everything entering into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out into excrement?

18. But those things going out from the mouth come forth from the heart; and these pollute the man.

19. For out of the heart proceed evil reasonings, murders, fornications, adulteries, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.

20. These are the things which defile the man: but to eat bread with unwashed hands does not defile the man.

21. And Jesus having come out thence, departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.

22. And behold, a Canaanitish woman having come out from those coasts, cried unto Him saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is terribly demonized.

23. And He responded to her not a word; and His disciples, having come to Him, asked Him, saying, Send her away; because she cries after us.

24. And He responding said, I am not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. And having come she continued to worship Him, saying, Lord, assist me.

26. He responding said, It is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to the little dogs.

27. And she said, Yea, Lord: for the little dogs eat of the crumbs falling from their master's table.

28. Then Jesus responding said to her, O woman, great is thy faith; let it be done unto thee as thou dost wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.

29. And Jesus having departed thence, came to the Sea of Galilee; and having gone up into the mountain, He was sitting there.

30. And many multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deaf, the maimed, and many others, and laid them down at the feet of Jesus; and He healed them:

31. so that the multitudes were astonished, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking about, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. And Jesus calling His disciples to Him, said, I sympathize with the multitude, because already three days abide unto me, and they have nothing which they may eat; I do not wish to send them away fasting, lest they may faint on the road.

33. And His disciples say to Him, Whence is there to us so much bread in the wilderness, as to feed so great a multitude?

34. And Jesus says to them; How much bread have ye? And they said, Seven loaves and a few fishes.

35. He having commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground,

36. He took the seven loaves and the fishes; having given thanks, He broke them, and gave to His disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

37. And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up the residue of fragments, seven baskets full.

38. And those eating were about tour thousand men, besides women and children.

39. And having sent away the multitudes, He went into a ship and came into the coasts of Magdala. 

## Matthew 16

1. And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come to Him, tempting Him, asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.

2. And He responding said to them, It being evening, you say, It will be fair weather: because the sky is red:

3. and in the morning, It will be stormy to-day: for the lowering sky is red: ye hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the sky: but are you not able to discern the signs of the times?

4. A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And no sign shall be given it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And leaving them, He departed.

5. His disciples having come to the other side forgot to take bread.

6. And Jesus said to them; See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

7. And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, That it is because we did not take bread.

8. And Jesus knowing said to them, Why do you reason among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because you did not take bread?

9. Do you not yet understand? do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

10. Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?

11. How do you not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.

12. Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of the (bread) of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. And Jesus having come into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, asked His disciples, saying, Whom do the people say that I, the Son of man, am?

14. And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

15. And He says to them, But whom do you say that I am?

16. And Simon Peter responding said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

17. And Jesus responding said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon the son of Jonah: because flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.

18. And I say to thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

19. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens: and whatsoever you may bind on the earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever you may loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens.

20. Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He is the Christ.

21. And from this time Jesus began to show to His disciples, that it behooves Him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders and the chief priest and the scribes, and to be killed, and rise the third day.

22. And Peter taking Him to him, began to rebuke Him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord; because this shall not be unto thee.

23. And turning He said to Peter, Get behind me, adversary: thou art my stumbling-block; because thou art not thinking about the things of God, but those of men.

24. Then Jesus said to His disciples, If any one wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For whosoever may wish to save his soul shall lose it: and whosoever may lose his soul for my sake shall find it.

26. For what is a man profited, if he may gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

27. For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will give to each one according to his works.

28. Truly I say unto you, There are some of those standing here, who may not taste of death, until they may see the Son of man coming in His kingdom. 

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John his brother, and carries them up into an exceedingly high mountain privately.

2. And was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became white as the light.

3. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared unto them, talking with Him.

4. And Peter responding, said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: it you will, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. He still speaking, behold, a white cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted; hear ye Him.

6. And the disciples, hearing, fell on their face, and feared exceedingly.

7. And Jesus came to them and touching them said, Arise, and fear not.

8. And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.

9. And they coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of man may rise from the dead.

10. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that it behooves Elijah to come first?

11. And Jesus responding said to them, Elijah indeed comes, and will restore all things:

12. but I say unto you, that Elijah has already come, and they recognized Him not, but did unto Him so many things as they wished; thus the Son of man is also about to suffer by them.

13. Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.

14. And they having come to the multitude, the man came to Him, worshiping Him on his knees,

15. and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is a lunatic and suffers terribly: for frequently he falls into the fire, and frequently into the water.

16. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.

17. And Jesus responding said: O, faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? bring him hither to me.

18. And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out from him, and the child was healed from that hour.

19. Then the disciples coming to Jesus privately, said, Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?

20. and Jesus says to them, On account of your unbelief. For truly I say unto you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.

21. And they sojourning in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.

22. And they will kill Him; and He will rise the third day. And they were grieved exceedingly.

23. And they having come into Capernaum, those receiving the double drachma came to Peter, and said, Does your teacher pay the double drachma?

24. He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What seems to you, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? from their own sons or aliens?

25. And he saying from aliens, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.

26. But in order that we may not offend them, going to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the first fish coming up; and opening its mouth, you will find a stater: having received it, give it to them for me and thee. 

## Matthew 18

1. At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Then which one is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens?

2. And Jesus calling a little child to Him, placed it in the midst of them,

3. and said, Truly I say unto you, unless you may be converted, and become as little children, you can not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

4. Therefore whosoever shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens;

5. and whosoever shall receive such little child in my name, receives me.

6. But whosoever may offend one of these little ones, who believe in me, it is good for him that a millstone may be hanged to his neck, and he may be drowned in the depth of the sea.

7. Woe unto the world on account of offensives, for it is necessary that offensives come; but woe unto that man through whom the offense comes!

8. If thy hand or thy foot offends thee, cut them off and cast them from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.

9. And if thine eye offend thee, cast it from thee: it is good for thee having one eye entering into life, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of the fire.

10. See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens.

11. What seems to you? if there may be a hundred sheep to one man, and one of them may go astray, does he not, leaving the ninety and nine, going to the mountains, seek that which has gone astray?

12. And if it maybe that he finds it, truly I say unto you, that he rejoiceth more over it than over the ninety and nine that went not astray.

13. So it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens, that one of these little ones may perish.

14. But if thy brother may sin, go, and convict him between thee and him alone: if he may hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother:

15. if he may not hear thee, take with thyself one or two, in order that in the mouth of two or three witnesses the word may stand.

16. But if he may not hear them, tell the church: and if indeed he may not hear the church, let him be to thee as a heathen and publican.

17. Truly I say unto you, that whatsoever things you may bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever things you may loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

18. Again I say unto you, that if two of you may agree upon the earth concerning everything which you may ask, it shall be done unto you by my Father, who is in the heavens.

19. For where two or three are assembled in my name, there I am in the midst of them.

20. Then Peter, coming to Him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?

21. Jesus says to him, I say not unto thee, Until seven time; but Until seventy times seven.

22. Therefore the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a kingly man, who wished to make a reckoning with his servants.

23. And he beginning to reckon, one was brought to him owing him myriads of talents.

24. And he not having wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all things so many as he had, and payment to be made.

25. Then that servant falling down, continued to worship him, saying, Be patient with me, and I will pay you all.

26. The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, sent him away, and forgave him the debt.

27. And that servant having gone out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him one hundred denaria: seized him, throttled him, saying, Pay me what you owe me.

28. Then his fellow-servant falling down, continued to intreat him, saying, Be patient with me and I will pay thee.

29. And he was not willing: but having gone away he cast him into prison, until he could pay that which was owing.

30. Then his fellow-servants seeing those things which had taken place, were grieved exceedingly, and coming related to their lord all the things which transpired.

31. Then his lord calling him says to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, since thou didst intreat me:

32. did it not behoove thee also to have mercy on thy fellow-servant, as I had mercy on thee?

33. And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormenters, until he should pay all that was due him.

34. Thus my Heavenly Father will also do unto you, if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts. 

## Matthew 19

1. And it came to pass when Jesus finished these sermons, He departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea, beyond the Jordan.

2. And many multitudes followed Him; and He healed them there.

3. And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him, and saying to Him; Is it lawful for a man to send away his wife for any cause?

4. And He responding said to them, Have you not read, that the one having made them from the beginning made them male and female?

5. And He said, On account of this a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.

6. So they are no longer two, but one flesh: therefore what God joined together, let no man separate.

7. They say to Him, Then why did Moses command to give a book of divorcement, and to send her away?

8. He says to them, Moses on account of the hardness of your heart permitted you to send away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

9. But I say unto you, That whosoever may send away his wife, not for fornication, and may marry another, commits adultery.

10. His disciples say to Him, If the cause of a man with his wife is thus, it is better not to marry.

11. And He said to them, All do not receive this word, but those to whom it has been given.

12. For there are eunuchs, who have been so born from the womb of their mother. And there are eunuchs, who have been eunuchized by men: and there are eunuchs, who eunuchized themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.

13. Then little children were brought to Him, that He might put His hands on them, and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.

14. But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.

15. And putting His hands on them, he departed thence.

16. Behold, one coming to Him said, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do, in order that I may have eternal life?

17. And He said to him, Why do you ask me concerning the good One? One is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. He says to Him, What? And Jesus said to him, Thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt hot steal, thou shalt not bear false witness,

19. honor the father and the mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

20. The young man says to Him, All these have I kept from my youth: what lack I yet?

21. Jesus said to him, If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

22. And the young man hearing the word, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

23. And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say unto you, that a rich man will hardly enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

24. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of God.

25. And the disciples hearing, were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then is able to be saved?

26. And Jesus looking on them said; With men this is impossible; but all things are possible with God.

27. Then Peter responding said to Him, Behold, we have left all things, and followed Thee; what then shall be to us?

28. And Jesus said to them, Truly I say unto you, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man may sit upon the throne of His glory, you shall also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And every one who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, on account of my name, shall receive a hundred-fold, and inherit eternal life.

30. But many who are first shall be last, and the last first. 

## Matthew 20

1. For the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a landlord man, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.

2. And having agreed with the laborers for a denarion per day, sent them into his vineyard.

3. And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the forum:

4. and he said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they departed.

5. Again having gone out about the sixth and ninth hours, he did likewise.

6. And about the eleventh hour having gone out, he found others standing; and says to them, Why stand ye here idle all the day?

7. They say to him, Because no one hired us. He says to them, Go ye also into the vineyard.

8. And it being evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last even unto the first.

9. And those having come about the eleventh hour, received each man a denarion.

10. But the first having come supposed that they shall receive more; and themselves also received each one a denarion.

11. But receiving it, they murmured against the landlord,

12. saying, These labored one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who bore the burden of the day and the heat.

13. But he responding said to one of them, Comrade, I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a denarion?

14. Take thine own, and go. I wish to give unto this last one, even as unto thee.

15. Is it not lawful for me to do as I wish with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

16. So the last shall be first, and first last.

17. And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples privately, on the way and said to them,

18. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,

19. and they will deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and scourge, and crucify Him: and on the third day He will rise.

20. Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshiping and asking something from Him.

21. And He said to her, What do you wish? She says to Him, Tell me that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.

22. And Jesus responding said, You know not what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They say to Him, We are able.

23. And He says to them, You shall indeed drink my cup, but to sit on my right, and on my left, this is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.

24. And the ten hearing were indignant concerning the two brothers.

25. But Jesus calling them to Him, said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.

26. It shall not be so among you; but whosoever may wish to be great among you, shall be your servant;

27. and whosoever may wish to be first among you, shall be your slave:

28. as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His soul a ransom for many.

29. And they going out from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.

30. And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, hearing that Jesus is passing by, cried out, saying; Have mercy on us, O son of David.

31. And the multitude rebuked them, that they should keep silent. And they cried out the more, saying; Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David.

32. Jesus standing, called them, and said, What do you wish that I shall do unto you?

33. They say unto Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

34. And Jesus being moved with compassion, touched their eyes: and immediately they looked up; and followed Him. 

## Matthew 21

1. When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent away two disciples,

2. saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and you will immediately find a donkey tied, and the colt with her: loosing, lead her to me.

3. And if any one may say any thing to you, tell him, that the Lord hath need of them; and immediately he will send them away.

4. And all this took place, that the word spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,

5. Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh, meek, and seated upon a donkey, even a colt, the progeny of the work-beast.

6. And the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus commanded them,

7. led the donkey, and the colt, and put their garments on them; and He sat on them.

8. A great multitude strewed their garments in the road: and others cut down the branches from the trees, and were strewing them in the road.

9. And the multitudes going forward, and following, continued to cry out, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!

10. And He having come into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying; Who is He?

11. And the multitudes continued to say, He is the prophet Jesus, the one from Nazareth of Galilee.

12. And Jesus came into the temple of God, and cast out all the buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-exchangers, and the seats of those selling the doves;

13. and He says to them, It has been written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but you make it a den of thieves.

14. And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple: and He healed them.

15. And the chief priests and scribes seeing the wonderful things which He did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying; Hosanna to the son of David, were indignant,

16. and said to Him, Do you hear what they are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yes: have you not read, That out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

17. And having left them, He went out of the city into Bethany, and there spent the night.

18. And in the morning going into the city, He was hungry.

19. And seeing one fig-tree near the road, He went to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only. And He says to it, Let no fruit ever be from thee; and immediately the fig-tree withered away.

20. And the disciples seeing, were astonished, saying, How did the fig-tree immediately wither away?

21. And Jesus responding said to them, Truly I say unto you, if you may have faith, and doubt not, not only shall you do that of the fig-tree, but you shall say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and it will be done.

22. All things whatsoever you may ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.

23. And the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him, while teaching, He having come into the temple, saying, By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?

24. And Jesus responding, said to them, I ask you also one word, which if you may speak to me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things:

25. Whence was the baptism of John? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we may say, From heaven; He will say to us, Why then did you not believe on him?

26. But if we may say, From men: we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.

27. And responding they said to Jesus, We do not know. He also said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

28. What seems to you? A man had two sons; and going to the first, he said, Child, go to-day, work in my vineyard.

29. And he responding said, I am not willing: but afterward, having regretted, he went.

30. And coming to the second, he spoke likewise. And he responding said, I, lord: and went not.

31. Which one of the two did the will of the father? They say to Him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say unto you, that the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

32. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and harlots believed him, and you, seeing, did not afterward regret it, in order that you might believe him.

33. Hear ye another parable. A man was a landlord, who planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge around it, and dug a wine-trough in it, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went away.

34. And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits;

35. and the husbandmen taking his servants, beat one, and slew one, and stoned another.

36. Again he sent other servants, more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.

37. And afterward he sent to them his own son, saying, They will reverence my son.

38. But the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take possession of his inheritance.

39. And taking him, they cast him out of the vine-yard, and slew him.

40. Then when the lord of the vine-yard may come, what will he do to those husbandmen?

41. They say to Him, He will certainly destroy those wicked men, and give the vineyard to other husband-men, who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.

42. Jesus says, Have you not read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same has come to be the head of the corner: this was with the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes?

43. Therefore I say unto you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.

44. And the chief priests and Pharisees hearing His parables, knew that He speaks concerning them.

45. And seeking to arrest Him, they feared the multitudes, since they held Him as a prophet. 

## Matthew 22

1. And Jesus responding, again spoke to them in parables, saying,

2. The kingdom of the heavens is like a king-man, who made a marriage for his son.

3. And he sent his servants to invite those who had been called to the marriage: and they were not willing to come.

4. And again he sent other servants, saying; Speak to those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatling are slain, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.

5. And they being careless, went away, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise:

6. but the rest, taking his servants, insulted, and slew them.

7. And the king was angry; and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their cities.

8. Then he says to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those having been invited were not worthy.

9. Go ye therefore to crossings of the roads, and so many as you may find, invite to the marriage.

10. And those servants having gone out into the ways, led in all whom they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.

11. And the king having come in to look upon the guests, saw there a man not having on a wedding-garment.

12. And he says to him, Comrade, how did you come in hither, not having the wedding-garment? And he was silent.

13. Then the king said to the servants, Having bound him feet and hands, cast him into the darkness which is without; and there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

14. For many are called, but few elected.

15. Then the Pharisees going forth, took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His speech.

16. And they send to Him their own disciples along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and that thou art teaching the way of God in truth, and there is not a care to thee for any one; for thou dost not look into the face of men.

17. Then tell us, what seems good to thee? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

18. And Jesus knowing their wickedness, said, Why tempt ye me, O ye hypocrites?

19. Show me the tribute money: and they brought Him a denarion.

20. And He says to them, Whose is this image and superscription?

21. They say to Him, Caesar's. Then He says to them, Therefore render Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's.

22. And hearing they are astonished, and leaving Him, they went away.

23. On that day the Sadducees came to Him, saying, there is no resurrection: and asked Him,

24. saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any man may die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

25. But there were among us seven brothers: the first marrying died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.

26. Likewise also, the second, and third, even unto seven.

27. And last of all the woman also died.

28. Therefore in the resurrection, of which one of the seven shall she be the wife? for they all had her.

29. and Jesus responding said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as angels of God in heaven:

31. concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,

32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

33. And the multitudes hearing, were delighted with His teaching.

34. And the Pharisees, hearing that He silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.

35. And one of them, a theologian, tempting Him, asked Him also, saying,

36. Teacher, what is the great commandment in the law?

37. And He said to him; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

38. This is the first and great commandment.

39. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

40. On these two commandments hang all the law, and the prophets.

41. And the Pharisees being assembled, Jesus asked them,

42. saying, What seems to you concerning the Christ? whose son is He? They say to Him, Of David.

43. He says to them, How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying,

44. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?

45. Then if David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?

46. And no one was able to respond a word to Him, neither did any one from that day dare to ask Him anything more. 

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and His disciples,

2. saying, The scribes and Pharisees sat upon the seat of Moses;

3. therefore do and keep all things so many as they may speak to you, but do not according to their works; for they say, and do not.

4. But they bind heavy burdens, and place them on the shoulders of the people; and they themselves are not willing to touch them with their finger.

5. And they do all their works to be seen by the people: for they broaden their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,

6. and they love the first couch at the suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,

7. and salutations in the forums, and to be called by the people, ""Doctor.""

8. But be ye not called Doctor: for One is your teacher; and you are all brothers.

9. And call no man father upon the earth: for One is your Heavenly Father.

10. Be not called teachers: because One is your teacher, Christ.

11. And the great of you shall be your deacon.

12. But whosoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.

13. But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut up the kingdom of the heavens against the people: for you do not go in, neither do you permit those coming in to enter.

14. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you compass the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when it may be done, you make him twofold more the son of hell than yourselves.

15. Woe unto you, blind guides, who are saying, Whosoever may swear by the temple it is nothing; but whosoever may swear by the gold of the temple, he is debtor.

16. Ye fools and blind: for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple sanctifying the gold?

17. And, Whosoever may swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever may swear by the gift upon it, is debtor.

18. Ye blind: for which is the greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifies the gift?

19. Therefore the one swearing by the altar, swears by it, and by all things which are on it.

20. And the one swearing by the temple, swears by it, and by Him who inhabited it.

21. And the one swearing by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by Him that sitteth upon it.

22. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you tithe mint and anise and cummin, and pass by the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: it behooves to do these and not to neglect those.

23. Ye blind guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow down the camel.

24. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you purify the exterior of the cup and the plate, and within they are full of extortion and impurity.

25. Ye blind Pharisee, first purify the inside of the cup, in order that its outside may be clean.

26. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you are like whitened sepulchers, which are beautiful indeed externally, but within they are full of the hones of the dead people, and every impurity.

27. So you also appear unto the people indeed righteous, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

28. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and ornament the sepulchers of the righteous,

29. and you say, If we were in the days of our fathers we would not have been their fellow-partakers in the blood of the prophets.

30. So you witness to yourselves, that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.

31. And you fill up the measure of your fathers.

32. Ye serpents, generations of vipers, how can you escape from the judgment of hell?

33. Therefore I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: you will kill and crucify some of them; and will scourge some of them in your synagogues, and will persecute them from city to city;

34. in order that all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zachariah the son of the blessed, whom they slew between the temple and the altar, may come upon you.

35. Truly I say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation.

36. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that have been sent unto thee! how frequently did I wish to gather together thy children, in the manner in which a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but ye were not willing!

37. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

38. For I say unto you, that ye can see me no more until you can say; Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. 

## Matthew 24

1. Jesus having gone out departed from the temple, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.

2. And responding, He said to them, Do you not see all these? Truly, I say unto you, that stone may not be left here upon stone, which shall not be thrown down.

3. And He sitting upon the Mount of Olives; the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when these things shall be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the age?

4. And Jesus responding said to them, See, lest any one may deceive you.

5. For many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and they will deceive many.

6. And you will be about to hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you are not disturbed: for it behooveth all these things to be, but the end is not yet.

7. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places.

8. And all these things are the beginning of travails.

9. Then they will deliver you into tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of my name,

10. and then many will be offended; and they will betray one another, and hate one another.

11. And many false prophets will arise and deceive many.

12. And because iniquity doth abound, the divine love of many will grow cold.

13. But the one persevering to the end, the same shall be saved.

14. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then the end shall come.

15. Then when you may see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth know),

16. then let those who are in Judea fly to the mountains:

17. and let him who is on the housetop not come down to take things out of his house:

18. and let not the one in the field turn back to take his garment.

19. But alas unto those who are in gestation and nursing in those days.

20. But pray that your flight may not be in the winter, nor on the Sabbath.

21. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world even until now nor ever may be.

22. And if those days were not shortened, no life would be saved: but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.

23. Then if any one may say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or, there: believe him not:

24. for false Christs and false prophets will rise up, and give great signs and wonders; so as to deceive even the elect, if possible.

25. Behold, I have foretold you.

26. Therefore if they may say to you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not out: Behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe them not.

27. For as the lightning comes from the east, and shines even unto the west; so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.

28. For where the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.

29. And immediately, after the desolation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

30. And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in the heaven: and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and will see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.

31. And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather His elect out of the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens, unto the extremities of the same.

32. But learn the parable from the fig-tree: when her branch may now be tender, and she may grow out leaves, know that the summer is nigh.

33. So you also, when you may see all these things know that it is at the doors.

34. Truly I say unto you, This race may not pass away until all these things may be fulfilled.

35. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words can not pass away.

36. Concerning that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels of the heavens, except my Father only.

37. But as were the days of Noah, so indeed shall be the coming of the Son of man.

38. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day on which Noah entered into the ark,

39. and they did not know until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.

40. Then two men shall be in the field; one is taken, and one is left.

41. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.

42. Watch therefore: because you do not know on what day your Lord cometh.

43. But know this, that if the landlord knew at what watch the thief cometh, he would have watched, and would not have permitted his house to be broken into.

44. Therefore be ye also ready: because the Son of man cometh in an hour at which you do not think.

45. Then who is the faithful and wise servant, whom the lord placed over his household to give them their food in season?

46. Happy is that servant whom, his lord having come, will find so doing.

47. Truly I say unto you, that he will appoint him over all his possessions.

48. But if the wicked servant may say in his heart,

49. My lord delayeth; and may begin to smite his fellow-servants, and eat and drink with the drunken;

50. the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he does not expect, and an hour in which he does not know,

51. and he will cut him off, and will appoint his part with hypocrites: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth. 

## Matthew 25

1. Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened unto ten virgins, who taking their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom.

2. And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.

3. For the foolish, taking their lamps, took no oil with themselves:

4. and the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

5. But the bridegroom tarrying, they all nodded and slept.

6. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom! go ye out to meet him.

7. Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.

8. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.

9. And the wise responded, saying, No, lest there may not be a sufficiency for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

10. And they going to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.

11. And afterwards the other virgins come, saying; Lord, lord, open unto us.

12. And he responding, said; Truly I say unto you, I know you not.

13. Watch therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.

14. For as a man going away, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods,

15. to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each one according to his own ability; and departed.

16. The one having received the five talents going immediately, operated with the same, and made other five talents.

17. Likewise the one having received two gained two others.

18. And he having received one, having gone away, digged up the earth, and buried the money belonging to his lord.

19. And after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes a reckoning with them.

20. And the one having received the five talents coming to him brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me five talents: behold, I have gained other five talents.

21. His lord said to him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou wast faithful over few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things: come thou into the joy of thy lord.

22. And the one having received two talents, coming to him, said, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me two talents: behold, I have gained other two talents.

23. And his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: come thou into the joy of thy lord.

24. And the one having received one talent also coming, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewn:

25. and being afraid, having gone away, I hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine own.

26. And his Lord responding said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, didst thou know that I gather where I have not sown, and reap where I have not strewn?

27. Therefore it behooved thee to put my money in the bank, and having come, I would receive my own with the product.

28. Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to the one having ten talents.

29. For to every one having it shall be given, and he shall superabound: but from the one not having shall be taken away even that which he has.

30. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the darkness which is without: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.

31. But when the Son of min may come in His glory, and all His angels with Him, then will He sit upon the throne of His glory:

32. and all nations shall be gathered before Him: and He will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats:

33. and He will place the sheep on His right, and the goats on His left.

34. Then the King will say to those on His right, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom which has been prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in;

36. was naked, and ye clothed me: was sick, and ye visited me: was in prison, and ye came unto me.

37. Then the righteous will respond to Him, saying; Lord, when saw we thee then hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

38. And when saw we thee then a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?

39. But when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

40. And the King responding will say unto them, Truly I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did these things to one of the least of these my brethren, you did them unto me.

41. Then will He also say unto those on the left, Depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.

42. For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink:

43. I was a stranger and you took me not in; was naked, and you clothed me not; was sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.

44. Then will they also respond, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and ministered not unto thee?

45. Then will He respond to them, saying, Truly I say unto you, Inasmuch as you did not these things to one of the least of these, you did them not unto me.

46. And these shall go away into eternal punishment: and the righteous into eternal life. 

## Matthew 26

1. And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these discourses, He said to His disciples,

2. You know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is delivered to be crucified.

3. Then the chief priests, and scribes, and elders of the people, were assembled in the hall of the high priest, called Caiaphas.

4. And they immediately passed the verdict that they would take Jesus by stratagem, and kill Him.

5. But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.

6. And Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. a woman having an alabaster box of myrrh, very valuable, came to Him and poured it on His head, while sitting at the table.

8. And His disciples, seeing, were indignant, saying, For what was this waste?

9. For this was able to be sold for much, and given to the poor.

10. And Jesus knowing, said to them, Why do you give the woman trouble? because she hath wrought a beautiful work in me.

11. For you have the poor with you always; but you have not me always.

12. For she pouring this myrrh on my body, did it in order to my burial.

13. Truly I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel may be preached in all the world, that which she did shall indeed be spoken of for a memorial of her.

14. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, going to the chief priests,

15. said, What do you wish to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they offered him thirty pieces of silver.

16. And from that time he was seeking opportunity that he might betray Him.

17. On the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him; Where do you wish that we may prepare for you to eat the passover?

18. And He said; Go into the city to a certain one, and say to him; The Teacher says; My time is nigh; I make the passover with you along with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the passover.

20. And it being evening, He sat down at the table with the twelve.

21. And they eating, He said; Truly, I say unto you, that one of you will betray me.

22. And they being exceedingly sorrowful, began each one of them to say to Him, Lord, whether am I the one?

23. And responding He said, The one dipping his hand in the dish with me, the same shall betray me.

24. Indeed the Son of man goeth, as has been written concerning Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man had never been born.

25. But Judas, the one betraying Him, responding said, Master, whether am I the one? He says to him, Thou hast said it.

26. And they eating, Jesus taking the bread, and blessing it, broke, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

27. Also taking the cup, and blessing it, He gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all, of it;

28. for this is my blood which belongs to the new covenant, which is shed for many unto the remission of sin.

29. And I say unto you, that I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I may drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.

30. Having sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives.

31. Then Jesus says to them, You will all be offended in me this night: for it has been written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.

32. And after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. But Peter responding said to Him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.

34. Jesus said to him, Truly I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

35. And Peter says to Him, If it may be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewise also all the disciples said.

36. Then Jesus comes with them into a place called Gethsemane, and He says to His disciples, Sit here, until I having gone may pray there.

37. And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to grieve and to be dejected.

38. Then He says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: abide here, and pray with me.

39. And having gone forward a little, He fell on His face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: moreover not as I will, but as thou wilt.

40. And He comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Were you not able to watch with me one hour?

41. Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. And again the second time, having gone away, He prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible that this cup pass from me, if I shall not drink it, let thy will be done.

43. And having come He finds them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

44. And leaving them, having gone away, He prayed again the third time, speaking the same word.

45. Then He comes to His disciples, and says to them, Sleep on, and take your rest, behold, the hour is nigh, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners:

46. arise, let us go: behold, the one having betrayed me is nigh.

47. And He still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. And the one having betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, The one whom I shall kiss, is He: hold Him fast.

49. And immediately coming forward to Jesus, he said, Hail, Master; and kissed Him copiously.

50. And Jesus said to him, Comrade, unto what do you come? Then having come forward they laid hands on Him, and bound Him.

51. And behold, one of those along with Jesus, reaching out his hand, drew his sword, and smiting the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.

52. Then Jesus says to him, Turn away thy sword into its place; for all taking the sword shall perish by the sword.

53. Whether do you think that I am not able now to call upon my Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?

54. How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, because it is necessary thus to be done?

55. And at that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, You have come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to take me: daily did I sit with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me:

56. but all this took place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving Him, fled away.

57. Taking Jesus they led Him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the chief priests and elders were assembled together.

58. And Peter followed Him a long way off, into the court of the high priest, and having come in, was sitting with the officers, to see the end.

59. And the high priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking false testimony against Jesus, in order that they might kill Him.

60. And they found none. And many false witnesses having come forward, they found none.

61. And afterwards two false witnesses having come forward, said, He said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and build it in three days.

62. And the high priest rising, said to Him, Do you respond nothing? what are they witnessing against you?

63. And Jesus was silent; and the high priest responding said to Him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou art the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus says to him, Thou didst say it. Moreover I say unto you, that, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

65. Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, He blasphemed: why have we yet need of witnesses? behold, now you heard His blasphemy:

66. what seems to you? They responding said, He is worthy of death.

67. They spat in His face, and buffeted Him: and they slapped Him,

68. saying, Prophesy unto us, who is the one smiting thee?

69. And Peter was sitting without in the court. And a certain maidservant came to him, saying, Truly, thou wast with Jesus the Galilean.

70. And he denied before all, I know not what you say.

71. And another maidservant saw him, having come to the gate, and says to them there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.

73. And after a little the bystanders coming to Peter, said, Truly, thou art also one of them, for indeed thy speech betrays thee.

74. Then he began to anathematize and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus having spoken to him, That before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And having gone out, he wept bitterly. 

## Matthew 27

1. And it being morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.

2. And having bound Him, took Him away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.

3. Then Judas, the one having betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, being seized with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

4. saying, I sinned betraying the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to it.

5. And throwing down the money in the temple, he departed; and having gone away hung himself.

6. And the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them in the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

7. And taking counsel, they purchased with them the field of the potter, for a burying place for strangers.

8. Therefore that field has been called, The field of blood, to this day.

9. Then the word having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, was fulfilled, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was valued, whom they of the sons of Israel did value;

10. and they gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord appointed me.

11. And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked Him, saying; Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest it.

12. And while He is accused by the chief priests and elders, He responded nothing.

13. Then Pilate says to Him, Do you not hear, bow many things they witness against you?

14. And He responded to him not one word, so that the governor marveled exceedingly.

15. And the governor during the feast was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wished.

16. But they had at that time a noted prisoner called Barabbas.

17. Then they being assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom do you wish that I may release unto you? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?

18. For he knew that they delivered Him on account of envy.

19. And he sitting on his tribunal, his wife sent to him, saying, Let there be nothing to thee and that just man: for this day I suffered many things in a dream on account of Him.

20. And the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

21. And the governor responding said to them, Which of the two do you wish that I shall release unto you? And they said Barabbas.

22. Pilate says to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let Him be crucified.

23. And the governor said, For what evil hath He done? And they continued to cry out more vociferously, saying, Let Him be crucified.

24. And Pilate seeing that he profits nothing, but rather an uproar supervenes, having taken water, washed his hands in the presence of the multitude, saying, For I am free from the blood of this just one: you shall see to it.

25. And all the people responding said, His blood be upon us, and upon our children.

26. Then he released unto them Barabbas.And having scourged Jesus, delivered Him up that He should be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the judgment hall, gathered to Him the whole band.

28. And having divested Him, put on Him a scarlet robe:

29. and plaiting a crown of thorns put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and bowing the knee to Him, continued to mock Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

30. And spitting on Him, they took the reed and struck Him on the head repeatedly.

31. And when they mocked Him, divesting Him of the robe, they put on Him His own raiment, and led Him away to crucify Him.

32. And going out they found a Cyrenean man, Simon by name: they compelled him that he should bear His cross.

33. Having come to the place called Golgotha, which is called the place of a skull.

34. And they gave Him vinegar mingled with gall to drink: and tasting, He was not willing to drink it.

35. And crucifying Him, they divided His garments, casting the lot,

36. and sitting down, they continued to watch Him there.

37. And they placed over His head, His accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. Then two thieves are crucified along with Him, the one on the right and one on the left.

39. And going by they continued to blaspheme Him, wagging their heads,

40. and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.

41. Likewise also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, continued to say,

42. He saved others; He is not able to save Himself: if He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on Him.

43. He trusted in God; let Him now deliver Him, if He wishes Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.

44. And the thieves being crucified along with Him were also reproaching Him in the same manner.

45. And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

47. And certain ones of those standing there hearing, said, He is calling Elijah.

48. And one of them running and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, and extending it on a reed, gave Him drink.

49. And others were saying, Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah comes about to save Him.

50. And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, gave up His spirit.

51. And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom, and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;

52. and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose;

53. and having come out of the tombs after His resurrection came into the holy city and appeared unto many.

54. And the centurion and those watching Jesus with him, seeing the earthquake, and the things which took place, feared exceedingly, saying, Surely this was the Son of God.

55. And many women were there looking on from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee to minister unto Him,

56. among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

57. And it being evening, a rich man came from Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who himself also was a disciple to Jesus.

58. He having come to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be given:

59. and Joseph having received the body, wrapped it in clean linen,

60. and placed it in a new sepulcher, which he hewed in the rock: and having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, departed.

61. And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting in front of the tomb.

62. And on the following day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate, saying,

63. Lord, we remember that that deceiver, while yet living, said, After three days I will rise.

64. Command therefore that the tomb be made safe until the third day, lest His disciples having come, may steal Him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error shall be worse than the first.

65. Pilate said to them, You have a watch: go, make it safe as you know.

66. And having gone, they secured the tomb, sealing the stone, with the guard. 

## Matthew 28

1. And late on the Sabbath-day, on the dawn toward the first of the Sabbaths, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulcher.

2. And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel descending from heaven, having come rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

3. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.

4. And from fear of him the keepers did quake, and they became like dead men.

5. And the angel responding, said to the women, Be ye not afraid: for I know that you are seeking Jesus, who has been crucified.

6. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

7. And going quickly, tell His disciples, that He is risen from the dead; and behold, He goes before you into Galilee; and there you shall see Him; lo, I have told you.

8. And having come out quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy, they were running to tell His disciples.

9. And behold, Jesus met them, saying, Hail. And they having come forward, took hold of His feet, and worshiped Him.

10. Then Jesus says to them, Fear not: go tell my brethren, that they may depart into Galilee, and there they shall see me.

11. And they going, behold, certain ones of the watch having come into the city, proclaimed to the chief priests all things which had taken place.

12. And being assembled along with the elders, and taking counsel, they gave much money to the soldiers,

13. saying, You tell, that His disciples, having come by night, stole Him away while we slept.

14. And if this may be heard by the governor, we will persuade him and make you secure.

15. And they having received the money, did as they were instructed: and this report is current among the Jews until this day.

16. And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into the mountain where Jesus commanded them:

17. and seeing Him, they worshiped Him: but some doubted.

18. And Jesus having come spoke to them, saying, All authority is given unto me in heaven and upon earth.

19. Going, disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost:

20. teaching them to observe all things which I commanded you. And lo, I am with you all the days, unto the end of the age.
