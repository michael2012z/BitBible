# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, the apostle of Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Jesus Christ our hope;

2. to Timothy, my beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

3. As I exhorted you to remain in Ephesus, I going into Macedonia, in order that you may command certain ones not to teach heterodoxy,

4. nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which present questions, rather than the economy of God which is in faith:

5. but the end of the commandment is divine love out of a clean heart and a good conscience and faith free from hypocrisy:

6. from which certain ones having deflected have gone out into empty talking,

7. wishing to be teachers of the law, not knowing either what they are saying, or concerning what things they do affirm.

8. But we know that the law is good, if any one may use it lawfully;

9. knowing this, that the law is not made for the righteous, but for the unrighteous and disorderly, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and the profane, for patricides, matricides and homocides,

10. for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnapers, for liars, for perjurers, and if any thing else is opposed to healthy teaching;

11. according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which I am intrusted.

12. I give thanks to Jesus Christ our Lord, the one having filled me up with dynamite, because he considered me faithful, having put me in the ministry;

13. being antecedently a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an insulter: but I obtained mercy, because I did it in unbelief being ignorant;

14. but the grace of our Lord with faith and the divine love which is in Christ Jesus superabounded.

15. It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:

16. but on this account I obtained mercy, in order that Jesus Christ might in me the chief show forth all longsuffering, for an example of those about to believe on him unto eternal life.

17. But to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.

18. This charge I commit unto you, O child Timothy, according to the prophecies that went before on you, that you may war a beautiful warfare in the same;

19. having faith and a good conscience; which some having cast away have made shipwreck concerning the faith;

20. of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 

## 1 Timothy 2

1. Moreover, first of all things, I exhort you, that prayers, supplications, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made in behalf of all men;

2. for kings and all who are in authority; in order that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life in all godliness and honesty.

3. This is beautiful and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

4. who wishes all men to be saved, and to come to the perfect knowledge of the truth.

5. For there is one God, and there is also one mediator of God and men, the man, Christ Jesus,

6. the one having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in due time;

7. in which I have been placed a herald and an apostle I speak the truth, I lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and in truth.

8. Therefore I wish that men in every place would all pray, holding up holy hands, without wrath and doubting:

9. likewise that the women adorn themselves in comely apparel, with modesty and prudence; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly garments;

10. but whatsoever becomes women professing godliness, through good works.

11. Let a woman learn in silence in all submission;

12. but I do not permit a woman to dictate or usurp authority over her husband, but to be in silence.

13. For Adam was first created, then Eve.

14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression;

15. but she shall be saved through child-bearing, if they may abide in faith and in divine love and in sanctification with prudence. 

## 1 Timothy 3

1. It is a faithful saying, If any one desires the episcopacy, he covets a beautiful work.

2. Therefore it behooves the bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, modest, prudent, orderly, hospitable, competent to teach,

3. not given to wine, not a controvertist; but gentle, peaceable, not a money lover;

4. ruling his own house beautifully; having children in subordination with all gravity;

5. but if any one does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?

6. not a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the devil.

7. But it also behooves him indeed to have a beautiful testimony from the aliens, in order that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

8. Likewise let the deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not fond of filthy lucre;

9. having the testimony of faith in a pure conscience.

10. And let them also first be proven; then let them minister the office of deacon, being irreproachable.

11. Likewise let their wives be grave, not tattlers, modest, faithful in all things.

12. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses beautifully.

13. For those having ministered the office of a deacon beautifully procure to themselves beautiful progress, and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

14. I write these things to you, hoping to come to you more speedily;

15. but if I tarry, in order that you may know how it behooves you to deport yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

16. And assuredly great is the mystery of godliness; Who is manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, was seen of angels, was preached among the Gentiles, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory. 

## 1 Timothy 4

1. But the Spirit says positively, that in the last times certain ones will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and to the teachings of demons,

2. speaking lies in hypocrisy, having been cauterized as to their own conscience,

3. forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from meats, which God created for reception with thanksgiving to the faithful and to those perfectly knowing the truth.

4. Because every creature of God is good, and nothing rejected, being received with thanksgiving:

5. for it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.

6. Submitting these things to the brethren, you will be a beautiful minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of faith, and the beautiful teaching which you have followed;

7. but reject the unsanctified and silly stories: but exercise yourself unto godliness.

8. For bodily exercise is profitable unto little; but godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

9. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.

10. For unto this we toil and agonize, because we have hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.

11. Command and teach these things.

12. Let no one look with contempt upon your youth; but be you an example of the faithful, in word, in deportment, in divine love, in faith, in purity.

13. Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.

14. Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given unto you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

15. Be diligent in these things; give yourself wholly unto them; in order that your progress may be manifest to all.

16. Take heed to yourself and the teaching: continue in these things; for doing this you will indeed save yourself and those who hear you. 

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers:

2. the elderly women as mothers; the younger women as sisters, in all purity.

3. Honor widows who are truly widows.

4. But if any widow has children, or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety to their own house, and to give benefactions to their ancestors: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.

5. She who is truly a widow, and left alone, hopes in God, and abides in prayers and supplication night and day;

6. but she who is wanton is dead though living.

7. Indeed command these things, in order that they may be blameless.

8. But if any one provides not for his own, and especially those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

9. Let a widow not be taken into account under three score years, the wife of one husband,

10. being witness in beautiful works; if she has brought up children, if she has entertained strangers, if she has washed the feet of saints, if she has succored those in tribulation, if she has followed in every good work.

11. But reject the younger widows: for when they may wax wanton against Christ, they wish to marry;

12. having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith:

13. and at the same time they learn to be idle, going about houses; and not only idle, but also loquacious even busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

14. Therefore I wish the younger women to marry, to raise up children, to rule the house, to give no occasion to the adversary for the sake of reproach;

15. for already certain ones have turned away after Satan.

16. If any faithful woman has widows, let her support them, and let not the church be burdened; in order that she may give her attention to those who are truly widows.

17. Let the elders who stand before the people beautifully, be considered worthy of double remuneration, especially those laboring in the word and teaching.

18. For the scripture says, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The laborer is worthy of his hire.

19. Bring not an accusation against an elder, except before two or three witnesses.

20. Convict those who sin before all, in order that the rest may also have fear.

21. I testify before God, and Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you must guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.

22. Lay hands quickly on no one, and be not partaker of other men's sins.

23. Keep yourself pure. No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and on account of your frequent sickness.

24. The sins of some men are manifest beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they also follow after:

25. likewise truly are good works manifested beforehand; and those which are otherwise are not able to be hidden. 

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let the servants so many as are under the yoke, esteem those who are their masters worthy of all honor, in order that the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed.

2. But let those that have faithful masters not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather let them serve them, because they are the faithful and beloved who are partaking of the benefaction. Command these things and exhort them.

3. If any one teaches another doctrine, and does not give heed to the sound words which belonged to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;

4. he has been inflated, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and controversies, from which come envy, strife, blasphemies, evil surmisings,

5. wranglings of men having been corrupted as to their mind and turned away from the truth, considering that gain is godliness.

6. Godliness with contentment is great gain,

7. for because we have brought nothing into the world, we are not able to carry any thing out;

8. however having food and raiment we shall be contented with these.

9. But those wishing to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown the people in destruction and perdition.

10. For the love of money is a root of all evils: which some seeking after have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11. But you, O man of God, fly from these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, divine love, patience, meekness.

12. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, into which you have been called, and witnessed a beautiful testimony before many witnesses.

13. I charge you before God, who creates life in all things, and Jesus Christ, who witnessed a beautiful testimony before Pontius Pilate,

14. that you keep the commandment, spotless and pure, unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

15. which the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of the kings, and Lord of the lords, will manifest in his own due times;

16. he alone having immortality, inhabiting light unapproachable; whom no one of men has seen, or is able to see: to whom be honor and power eternal. Amen.

17. Charge the rich in this world not to think high things, nor to hope in uncertain riches, but in God, who richly supplies us all things for our enjoyment;

18. that they do good, be rich in good works, be cheerful givers, ready communicators;

19. laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed.

20. O Timothy, stand guard over that which has been committed to you, avoiding unsanctified, empty talks and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called,

21. which some proclaiming have made shipwreck concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
