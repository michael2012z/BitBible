## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, called an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and brother Sosthenes,

2. to the church of God being in Corinth, to the sanctified in Christ Jesus, to the called saints, along with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours:

3. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I give thanks to my God always in your behalf, for the grace of God given unto you in Christ Jesus;

5. because in everything you are enriched in him, in all speech and in all knowledge;

6. as the testimony of Christ is confirmed in you;

7. so that you are deficient in no spiritual gift; awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;

8. who will also establish you unblamable unto the end in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. God is faithful, through whom you have been called unto the fellowship of His Son our Lord Jesus Christ.

10. But I exhort you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you may all speak the same things, and that there may be no schisms among you; but you may be perfected in the same mind and in the same disposition.

11. For it has been revealed to me concerning you, my brethren, by those who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

12. And I say this, that each one says, I indeed am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

13. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?

14. I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius;

15. in order that no one may say that you are baptized in my name.

16. But I baptized also the family of Stephanas: besides, I know not if I baptized any other.

17. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with the wisdom of speech, in order that the cross of Christ may not be made of none effect.

18. For the word of the cross is foolishness indeed to those who are lost; but to those who are saved it is the power of God.

19. For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nought the understanding of the intelligent.

20. Where is the wise man? where is the scribe? where is the investigator of this age? has not God rendered the wisdom of the world foolishness?

21. For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.

22. Since indeed the Jews ask for miracles, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;

23. but we preach Christ having been crucified, to the Jews indeed a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness;

24. but to you who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

25. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

26. For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many influential, not many high-born:

27. but God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may confound the strong;

28. and God has chosen the base-born of the world, and those of no reputation, the things which are not, that He may set at nought the things which are,

29. in order that no flesh can boast in the sight of God.

30. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God was made unto us wisdom, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:

31. in order that, as it has been written, Let him that glorieth glory in the Lord. 

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And I, brethren, having come unto you, came not in the excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming unto you the testimony of God.

2. For I determine to know nothing among you, except Jesus Christ, and Him having been crucified.

3. I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

4. And my speech and my preaching were not in the persuasive words of wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and the power:

5. in order that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

6. But we speak wisdom among the perfect: not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nought:

7. but we speak the wisdom of God having been hidden in a mystery, which God predestinated before the ages unto our glory:

8. which no one of the princes of this age knew; for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

9. But, as has been written, the things which eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.

10. But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.

11. For who of men knows the things of man, except the spirit of the man which is in him? so indeed no one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God.

12. But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God; in order that we may know the things which have been graciously given unto us from God.

13. Which things indeed we speak, not in the teachable words of human wisdom, but in the teachable words of the Spirit, expounding spiritual things to spiritual people.

14. But the intellectual man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

15. But the spiritual man discerns all things, and is himself discerned by no one.

16. For who knows the mind of the Lord, who shall give him counsel? But we have the mind of Christ. 

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And I, brethren, was not able to speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even babes in Christ.

2. I have fed you with milk, not with meat; for you were not yet able. But ye are not now yet able:

3. for ye are yet carnal. For where there are envy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and walking about according to man?

4. For when one may say, I am indeed of Paul; another, I am of Apollos; are you not men?

5. Then what is Apollos? and what is Paul? But ministers through whom ye believed; even as the Lord gave to each one.

6. I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

7. So neither is the one planting, nor the one watering anything, but God the one giving the increase.

8. But he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.

9. For we are God's fellow-laborers; ye are God's farm; ye are God's building.

10. According to the grace of God which was given unto me, I as a wise architect, laid the foundation; and another builds on it. Let each one take heed how he builds.

11. For other foundation no one is able to lay beside the one which is laid, who is Jesus Christ.

12. But if any one builds upon the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

13. the work of each will be made manifest: for the day will reveal it, because it is revealed by fire; and the same fire will try the work of each what soil it is.

14. And if the work of any one which he builds, abides, he will receive a reward:

15. But if the work of any one shall be burnt up, he shall suffer loss; but himself shall be saved, but as through the fire.

16. Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?

17. If any one destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which ye are.

18. Let no one deceive himself. If any one seems to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it has been written. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

20. And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

21. So let no one boast among men; for all things are yours;

22. whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come.

23. All things are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. 

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. So let a man consider us, as ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

2. Here, moreover, it is required among stewards, that every one must be found faithful.

3. But to me it is the smallest matter, that I may be judged by you, or by human day: but I do not judge myself.

4. For I know nothing against myself; but in this I am not justified; and the Lord is the one judging me.

5. So judge nothing before the time, until the Lord may come, who will also bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then praise shall be to each one from God.

6. But, brethren, I have transferred these things to myself and Apollos on your account: that you may learn among us not to be wise above what is written; in order that you may not be puffed up one in behalf of one against another.

7. For who judges you? and what have you which you did not receive. But if indeed you received it, why do you boast, as not having received it?

8. Already are ye filled, already have ye become rich; you did reign without us: and I would indeed that you did reign, in order that we also might reign along with you.

9. For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles the last, as exposed to death: that we may become a theater to the world, and to angels, and to men.

10. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonorable.

11. until this hour we both hunger and thirst, and suffer for insufficient clothing, and are buffeted; and we tramp,

12. and we toil working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure it;

13. being scandalized, we entreat: we have become as the offscourings of the world, the refuse of all things until now.

14. I do not write these things shaming you, but admonishing you as my beloved children.

15. For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, but you have not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

16. Therefore I exhort you, be ye imitators of me.

17. For this same thing I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ Jesus, as I teach everywhere in every church.

18. But some were inflated, as if I was not coming unto you.

19. But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord may will; and I will know not the word of those who have been puffed up, but the power.

20. For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

21. What do you wish? must I come unto you with the rod, or in divine love and the spirit of meekness? 

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. Fornication is truly heard of among you, and such fornication which is not among the heathens, that one should have the wife of his father.

2. And have you been inflated, and have not rather mourned, that the one having done this work may be taken from your midst?

3. For indeed I, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged the one having thus done this, as being present,

4. in the name of the Lord Jesus, you and my spirit being assembled, with the power of the Lord Jesus,

5. to turn over such a one to Satan for the destruction of carnality, in order that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6. Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?

7. Cleanse away the old leaven, in order that you may be a new lump, as you are free from leaven; for Christ has truly become our Passover.

8. So let us feast, not on the old leaven, nor on the leaven of sin and iniquity, but on the unleavened bread of purity and truth.

9. I have written unto you in a letter to have no fellowship with fornicators;

10. not at all with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and the extortioners, or with the idolators; since you ought therefore to come out of the world.

11. For now I have written unto you not to keep company with him, if any one denominated a brother may be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a scold, or drunken, or an extortioner; with such a one not to eat.

12. For why is it for me to judge the outsiders? Do you not judge those within? But God will judge those without.

13. Take away the wicked person from you, yourselves. 

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Which one of you having a matter dares to go to law with another before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?

2. Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the smallest judgments?

3. Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not indeed matters of this life?

4. Then if indeed you have judgments appertaining to this life, do you sit those down who are little esteemed in the church?

5. I speak this to your shame. Is there not one wise man among you who shall be able to judge between his brother?

6. But does brother go to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers?

7. Indeed it is already altogether a small matter to you, that you have law-suits one with another. Why do you not rather stiffer injustice? why are you not rather defrauded?

8. But you inflict injustice, and defraud, and that your brethren.

9. Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? He not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor Sodomites,

10. nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor scolds, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

11. And such were some of you: but you have washed, but you have been sanctified, but you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.

12. All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable: all things are lawful, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

13. Meats for the stomach, and the stomach for meats: but God will destroy both this and them. The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:

14. but God both raised up the Lord, and will raise you up through his power.

15. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? then taking the members of Christ, shall I make them the members of a harlot? it could not be so.

16. Do you not know that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? for it says, They two shall be one flesh.

17. But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.

18. Fly from fornication. Every sin which a man may commit is outside of his body; the one committing fornication sins against his own body.

19. Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? and you are not your own;

20. for you have been bought with a price: indeed glorify God in your body. 

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. But concerning those things about which you wrote to me: That it is good for a man not to receive a wife:

2. but on account of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.

3. Let the husband give to the wife that which is due, and likewise the wife also to the husband.

4. The wife has not the authority over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not the authority over his own body, but the wife.

5. Do not defraud one another, unless it may be with consent for a time, that you may give attention to prayer, and again come together, in order that Satan may not tempt you on account of your incontinency.

6. But I speak this according to knowledge, not according to commandment.

7. But I wish that all men were even as myself; but each one has his own gift from God, some one, and some another.

8. But I speak to the unmarried and the widows, that it is good for them that they may remain even as I:

9. but if they do not contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

10. But I proclaim to those who have married, not I, but the Lord, That a wife shall not depart from her husband

11. (but if indeed she may depart, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled unto her husband); and that the husband shall not send away the wife.

12. But I say to the rest, not the Lord, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, let him not send her away.

13. And if any wife has an unbelieving husband, and he is willing to live with her, let her not send away her husband.

14. For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the brother. Since then your children are unclean; but now they are holy.

15. But if the unbeliever departs, let him or her depart; the brother or the sister has not been enslaved in such things. God has called you in peace.

16. For what do you know, O wife, if you shall save your husband? And what do you know, O husband, if you shall save your wife?

17. If not as the Lord has imparted to each one, and as God has called each one, so let him or her walk. And thus I command in all the churches.

18. Is one called having been circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: has one been called in uncircumcision? let him not get circumcised.

19. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

20. Let each one abide in the same calling in which he is called.

21. Have you been called being a slave? let it not be a care to you: but if indeed you are able to become free, use it in preference.

22. For the one having been called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord's freeman: likewise the one having been called, while free, is the slave of Christ.

23. You have been bought with a price; be not the slaves of men.

24. Let each one remain with the Lord, in the same calling in which he was called, brethren.

25. But concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give knowledge, as one having obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.

26. But I consider this to be good on account of the present distress, that it is good for a man so to be.

27. Have you been given to a wife? do not seek separation; have you been separated from a wife? do not seek a wife.

28. But if, indeed you may marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin may marry, she has not sinned; but such shall have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.

29. But I say this, brethren; that the time is at hand, that moreover indeed those having wives may be as those not having;

30. and those weeping, as those not weeping; and those rejoicing, as those not rejoicing; and those buying, as those not possessing;

31. and those using the world, as those not using it thoroughly: for the fashion of this world is passing away.

32. I wish you to be free from solicitude. The unmarried man cares for the things of the Lord, in order that he may please the Lord:

33. but the one having married cares for the things of the world, in order that he may please his wife.

34. A wife and a virgin truly also differ: the unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit: but she having married cares for the things of the world, that she may please her husband.

35. I speak this for the profit of you yourselves; not that I may cast a burden upon you, but for that which is pleasing and acceptable to the Lord without perturbation.

36. But if any one considers that he is acting indiscreetly towards his virgin, if she may be marriageable, and thus it ought so to be, let him do what he wishes; he does not sin; let them marry.

37. But whosoever stands firm in his heart, having no necessity, and has the right according to his own will, and has determined this in his heart, to keep his virgin, will do well.

38. So indeed he that marries his own virgin does well; and he that marries her not will do better.

39. A wife has been given so long a time as her husband may live; but if her husband may die, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.

40. But she is happier if she may so remain, according to my opinion: but I realize that I truly have the Spirit of God. 

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. But concerning things offered to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but divine love builds up.

2. If any one seems to know anything, yet he knows not as it behooves him to know;

3. but if any one loves God he is known of him.

4. Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God except one.

5. For if indeed there are those who are called gods, whether in heaven or upon the earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;

6. but there is to us one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we in him.

7. But there is not knowledge in all people: but some, with the conscience of the idol even until now, eat as if it was sacrificed to the idol; and their conscience being weak is polluted.

8. But meat will not commend us to God; neither if we eat are we the better; nor if we eat not are we the worse.

9. See lest this liberty of yours may become a stumblingblock to the weak.

10. For if any one may see you having knowledge sitting at the table in the idol temple, will not the conscience of him, being weak, be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to the idols?

11. For the weak one is destroyed by your knowledge, the brother for whom Christ died.

12. And you, sinning so against the brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, are sinning against Christ.

13. If indeed meat causes my brother to stumble, I never eat any more meat, in order that I may not lay a stumblingblock in the way of my brother. 

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen the Lord Jesus? are you not my work in the Lord?

2. If I am not an apostle to others, but I am to you at least: for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.

3. My defence to those calling me in question is this.

4. Have we not a right to eat and drink?

5. Have we not a right to lead about a sister as a wife, as the other apostles also, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Have I and Barnabas alone not the right to forbear working?

7. Whoever goes to war at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and does not eat the fruit of it? or who shepherdizes a flock, and does not eat of the milk of the flock?

8. Whether do I speak these things according to a man? or does not the law indeed say these things?

9. For in the law of Moses it has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that plows. Is there a care to God for oxen,

10. or does he speak it altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us, That the one plowing ought to plow in hope, and the one threshing in hope of partaking.

11. If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

12. If others partake of your bounty, shall not we the more? But we have not used this privilege, but we bear all things, in order that we may not give a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.

13. Do you not know that those working in the sacrifices eat those things of the temple; and those serving the altar partake of the altar?

14. So also the Lord has commanded those preaching the gospel to live of the gospel.

15. But I have used none of these things. But I have not written these things that it may be so in me: for it is good for me rather to die than that any one shall make void my boasting.

16. For if I preach the gospel, there is no boasting to me; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I may not preach the gospel.

17. For if I do this willingly, I have a reward: but if unwillingly, I have been intrusted with a dispensation.

18. Then what is my reward? that preaching the gospel, I may render the gospel free from charge, in order that I may not use my right in the gospel.

19. For being free from all, I rendered myself servant to all, that I may gain the more.

20. And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I may gain the Jews; to those under the law, as under the law, not myself being under law, that I may gain those under the law;

21. to those without law, I became as without law, not being without the law of God, but under the law of Christ, that I may gain those without law.

22. To the weak I became as weak, that I may gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I may indeed save some.

23. But I do all these things for the sake of the gospel, that I may be its fellow-partaker.

24. Do you not know that those running in the stadium, indeed all run, and one receives the prize? So run, that you may receive it.

25. But every one contesting is abstinent in all things, they indeed also that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.

26. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, do I thus fight not as beating the air:

27. but I keep my body under, and enslave it, lest having preached the gospel to others, I myself may become disapproved. 

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;

2. and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

3. and they all did eat the same spiritual food;

4. and all did drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

5. But with many of them God is not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

6. And these became our examples, in order that we may not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

7. Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them were; as has been written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and arose up to play.

8. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day twenty-three thousand.

9. Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted Him, and were destroyed by serpents.

10. Neither murmur, as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.

11. But these things happened unto them as examples; and were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have descended.

12. So let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he may fall.

13. No temptation has overtaken you, except that which is human: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but with the temptation, He will also make a way of escape, in order that you may be able to bear it.

14. Therefore, my beloved, fly from idolatry.

15. As I speak to the wise; judge ye what I say.

16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

17. Because we, being many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of one bread.

18. See Israel after the flesh: are not all eating the sacrifices communicants of the altar?

19. Then what do I say? that idolatry is anything? or that an idol is anything?

20. But those things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. But I do not wish you to be the communicants of demons.

21. You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: you are not able to partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? whether are we stronger than he?

23. All things are lawful; but all things are not profitable. All things are lawful; but all things do not edify.

24. Let no one seek his own, but that of another.

25. Eat everything which is sold in market, asking no questions on account of conscience;

26. for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness of the same.

27. If any one of the unbelievers invite you, and you wish to go; eat everything which is placed before you, asking no questions on account of conscience.

28. But if any one may say to you; This is offered to an idol, eat not, on account of him who gave the information, and his conscience.

29. But I say the conscience not of himself, but of the other one. For why is my liberty judged by the conscience of another?

30. If I partake with grace, why am I traduced for that over which I give thanks?

31. Then whether you eat, or whether you drink, or what you do, do all things to the glory of God.

32. Be ye without offence, both to Jews, and to Greeks, and to the church of God:

33. as I also please all in all things, seeking not my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved. 

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.

2. But I praise you because you remember me in all things, and hold fast the commandments, as I delivered them unto you.

3. But I wish you to know, that Christ is the head of every man; and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.

4. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.

5. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is one and the same to her being shaven.

6. If a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a disgrace for a woman to be shorn or shaven; let her be covered.

7. For a man ought not to cover his head, being the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.

8. For the man is not from the woman; but the woman is from the man;

9. for man indeed was not created on account of the woman; but the woman on account of the man.

10. Therefore the woman ought to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.

11. Moreover neither is the woman without the man in the Lord, nor the man without the woman.

12. For as the woman is from the man, so the man also is by the woman; and all things from God.

13. Judge ye among yourselves: is it becoming for a woman to pray to God uncovered?

14. Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man may indeed have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?

15. But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory unto her: because the hair has been given to her for a covering.

16. If any one seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.

17. And proclaiming this, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.

18. For in the first place, indeed you coming together, I hear that there are schisms among you; and I in part believe it.

19. For it behooves that heresies should indeed be among you, in order that the approved may be made manifest among you.

20. Therefore you coming together, it is not to eat the Lord's supper:

21. for each one takes his own supper in eating; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

22. For have you not houses in which to eat and to drink? or do you cast contempt on the church of God, and shame those not having? What do I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.

23. For I received this from the Lord, which I have also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,

24. and having given thanks, broke it, and said; This is my body, which is for you: do this in remembrance of me.

25. Likewise also the cup, after supper, saying; This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this, as often as you may drink it, in remembrance of me.

26. For as often as you may eat this bread, and drink the cup, you do proclaim the death of the Lord, until he may come.

27. So whosoever may eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup;

29. for the one eating and drinking, net discerning the body, eats and drinks condemnation to himself.

30. Therefore many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.

31. But if we judged ourselves, we would not be judged:

32. But being judged, by the Lord we are chastised, in order that we may not be condemned along with the world.

33. So, my brethren, coming together to eat, wait for one another.

34. If one is hungry let him eat at home; in order that you may not come together unto condemnation. But I will set in order the remaining things when I may come. 

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. But concerning the spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.

2. You know that when you were heathens, you were following after dumb idols, as you were led.

3. Therefore I make known to you, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, Jesus is anathema; and no one is able to say; Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

4. But there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;

5. and there are diversities of ministries, and the same Lord.

6. And there are diversities of operations, and the same God, working all things in all.

7. But to each one the manifestation of the Spirit has been given unto profit.

8. For indeed to one the word of wisdom has been given by the Spirit; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

9. to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healings by the one Spirit;

10. and to another the workings of dynamites; and to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues:

11. and one and the same Spirit works all these in you, dispensing unto each one severally as he willeth.

12. For indeed there is one body, and it has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.

13. For indeed we have by one Spirit been baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, or bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.

14. For truly the body is not one member, but many.

15. If the foot may say; Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not on account of this not of the body.

16. And if the ear may say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, it is not on account of this not of the body.

17. If the eye were the whole body, where is the hearing? If the hearing where the whole body, where is the smelling?

18. But now God has placed the members each one of them in the body, as he wished.

19. And if all were one member, where is the body?

20. But now indeed the members are many, but the body is one.

21. But the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you:

22. but much more are the members of the body which seem to be the weaker necessary:

23. and those which we regard the more dishonorable members of the body, upon these we confer the more abundant honors; and our uncomely members have the more abundant comeliness;

24. but our comely members have no need. But God has adjusted the body, having given the more abundant honor to that part which lacked;

25. in order that there may be no schisms in the body, but the members may care the same for one another.

26. And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.

27. But you are the body of Christ and members one of another.

28. Whom God has, indeed, also placed in the church, first apostles, then prophets, then teachers, then dynamites, then gifts of healings, helps, leaderships, kinds of tongues.

29. Whether are all apostles? whether are all prophets? whether are all teachers? whether are all dynamites?

30. whether do all have the gifts of healings? whether do all speak with tongues? whether do all interpret?

31. Seek earnestly these greater gifts; and yet I show unto you a more excellent way. 

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. If I may speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not divine love, I have become a sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

2. And if I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not divine love, I am nothing.

3. And if I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I may give my body that I shall be burnt, and have not divine love, I am profited as to nothing.

4. Divine love suffers long; divine love is kind; divine love envies not; does not make a display of itself, is not puffed up,

5. does not behave itself uncomely, seeks not its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;

6. it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but it rejoices in the truth;

7. it bears all things, it believes all things, it hopes all things, it endures all things.

8. Divine love never falls: but whether there are prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there are tongues, they shall cease; whether there is knowledge, it shall vanish away.

9. For we know in part, and prophesy in part:

10. but when the perfect may come, that which is in part shall be done away.

11. When I was an infant, I talked like an infant, I thought like an infant, I reasoned like an infant: when I became a man, I put away the things of the infant.

12. For we now see through a mirror in an enigma; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know perfectly even as I am perfectly known.

13. But now abide faith, hope, divine love, these three; but the greatest of these is divine love. 

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Follow after divine love; and seek the spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.

2. For the one speaking with a tongue speaks not to men, but to God; for no one hears him; but he speaks mysteries in the spirit:

3. but the one prophesying speaks to men edification, exhortation, and comfort.

4. The one speaking with a tongue edifies himself; but the one prophesying edifies the church.

5. But I wish you all to speak with tongues, but rather that you may prophesy: but greater is the one prophesying, than the one speaking with tongues, unless he may interpret, in order that the church may receive edification.

6. But now, brethren, if I may come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or in instruction?

7. Nevertheless things without life, giving forth a voice, whether pipe or harp, if it may not give a distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped, or what is harped?

8. For if indeed the trumpet may give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the war?

9. Thus also if you through the tongue may give an indistinct word, how will that which is spoken be known? for you will be speaking into the air.

10. If it so happens that there are so many kinds of voices in the world, and nothing without a voice;

11. if then I do not understand the power of the voice, I will be a barbarian to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a barbarian to me.

12. So also you, since you are zealots of spirits, seek that you may abound unto the edification of the church.

13. Therefore let the one speaking with a tongue, pray that one may interpret.

14. For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit is praying, but my mind is not fruitful.

15. Then what is it? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray with my mind also: I will sing with my spirit, and I will sing with my mind also.

16. Since if you may bless with the spirit, how will one occupying the place of the unlearned say Amen to your blessing? since he does not know what you are saying.

17. For you indeed bless beautifully, but the other is not edified.

18. I thank God, I speak with tongue more than you all:

19. but I would rather speak five words in the church with my understanding, so that I may indeed teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

20. Brethren, be not children in intellect: but be infants in evil, but be perfect in intellect.

21. It has been written in the law; I will speak to this people with other tongues and with the lips of others; and thus they will not hearken unto me, says the Lord.

22. So tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelievers: and prophecy is not for the unbelievers, but for the believers.

23. Then if the whole church may come together, and all may speak with tongues, and the unlearned or unbelievers may come in, will they not say that you are gone mad?

24. But if all may prophesy, and some unbeliever or unlearned person may come in, he is convicted by all, he is discerned by all;

25. the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and thus falling upon his face he will worship God, proclaiming that God is truly in you.

26. Then what is it, brethren? When you may come together, each one has a psalm, has a lesson, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification.

27. If one speaks with a tongue, let it he by twos, or at most by threes, and separately; and let one interpret;

28. but if there may be no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; but let him speak to himself, and to God.

29. But let two or three prophets speak, and let the others give audience;

30. but if something may be revealed to another sitting down, let the first be silent.

31. For you are all able to prophesy one by one, in order that all may learn, and all may be comforted.

32. Truly the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;

33. for he is not a God of confusion, but of peace. So in all the churches of the saints,

34. let the women be silent in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to talk; but let them be subordinate, as the law also says.

35. But if they wish to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church.

36. Whether did the word of God come out from you? or has it reached unto you alone?

37. If any one seems to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him understand the things which I write to you, that they are of the Lord;

38. but if any one ignores, he is ignored.

39. So, my brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues;

40. but let all things be done decently and in order. 

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which you indeed received, in which you also stand,

2. by which you are also saved; which word I preached to you, if you hold it fast, otherwise you believed in vain.

3. For I delivered unto you in the first place that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

4. and that he was buried, and that he arose on the third day according to the Scriptures;

5. and that he was seen by Cephas; then by the twelve.

6. Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the more remain unto this day, but some have fallen asleep.

7. Then he was seen by James; then by all the apostles.

8. But last of all he was seen by me, as one born out of due time.

9. For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace was not vain toward me; but I have labored more abundantly than they all: and not I, but the grace of God with me.

11. Then whether I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.

12. But if Christ is preached that he is risen from the dead, how do certain ones among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13. but if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christ is not risen:

14. but if Christ is not risen, then indeed is our preaching vain, and your faith is vain.

15. And we are indeed found false witnesses of God; because we testified according to God that he raised Christ: whom he did not raise, if then the dead rise not.

16. But if the dead rise not, neither is Christ risen.

17. But if Christ is not risen, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.

18. Then indeed those having fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.

20. But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruit of them that slept.

21. For since death was through a man, the resurrection of the dead is also through a man.

22. For as in Adam all die, so truly in Christ shall all be made alive.

23. But each one in his own rank: Christ the first-fruit; then they who are Christ's, at His coming:

24. then the end, when he may deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he may destroy all government, all authority and power.

25. For it behooves him to reign until he may put all enemies under his feet.

26. Death the last enemy is destroyed.

27. For, he has subordinated all things beneath his feet. But when he may say, that all things have been subordinated, it is evident that the One having subordinated all things to him is excepted.

28. But when he may subordinate all things to him, then the Son himself will also be subordinated to him who hath subordinated all things to Himself, in order that God may be all things in all.

29. Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they also baptized for them?

30. Why indeed are we in jeopardy every hour?

31. I protest by your rejoicing, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.

32. If after the manner of men I have fought with the wild beasts in Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.

33. Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners.

34. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak to your shame.

35. But one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?

36. Thou foolish one, that which thou sowest, is not quickened unless it may die;

37. and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but naked grain, if it may happen to be of wheat, or of some one of the other grains;

38. but God gives it a body as he wished; and to each of the seeds its own body.

39. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is indeed a flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.

40. Indeed there are heavenly bodies, and there are earthly bodies: but indeed there is one glory of the heavenlies, and another glory of those upon the earth.

41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory:

42. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

43. it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.

44. It is sown a psychical body; it is raised a pneumatical body. If there is a psychical body, there is also a pneumatical (body).

45. As indeed it has been written; The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last man Adam, a life-creating spirit.

46. But that which is spiritual was not first, but that which is animal; afterward that which is spiritual.

47. The first man was from the earth, earthy: the second man from heaven.

48. As was the earthy, such are they also who are earthy; and as was the heavenly, such are they also who are heavenly.

49. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we must also bear the image of the heavenly.

50. But I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood are not able to inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.

51. Behold, I speak to you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

52. in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

53. For it behooves this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality.

54. But when this corruptible may put on incorruption, and this mortal may put on immorality, then shall the word which has been written be fulfilled, Death is swallowed up in victory.

55. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?

56. But the sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law.

57. But thanks be unto God, who gives us our victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. So, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. 

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. But concerning the contribution to the saints, as I commanded the churches of Galatia, so you also do.

2. On the first day of the week let each one of you lay by with himself treasuring up, that as to whatsoever he may be prospered, in order that there may be no collections at that time when I may come.

3. But when I may be present, whomsoever you may approve by your letters, these will I send to carry away your benefaction to Jerusalem:

4. if it may be counted worthy for me also to go, they shall go along with me.

5. But I will come to you when I may go through Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia;

6. and perhaps I may abide with you, and even spend the winter with you, in order that you may send me forward whithersoever I may go.

7. For I do not wish merely to see you in my journey; for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord may permit.

8. But I shall abide in Ephesus until Pentecost;

9. for a door is opened unto me great and effectual, and there are many antagonizing.

10. But if Timothy may come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I also:

11. therefore let no one snub him. But send him forth in peace, in order that he may come to me: for I await him with the brethren.

12. But concerning brother Apollos, I entreated him much, that he may come to you with the brethren: but it was not altogether his will that he may come now; but he will come when he may have opportunity.

13. Watch, stand in the faith, be men, be strong.

14. Let all your affairs be in divine love.

15. But I exhort you, brethren; (know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),

16. in order that you may indeed be in subjection unto such, and to every one laboring with you and toiling.

17. But I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: because they have supplied your deficiency:

18. for they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.

19. The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca along with the church and their house salute you.

20. All the brethren salute you. Salute you one another with a holy kiss.

21. The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.

22. If any one loves not the Lord as a friend, let him be anathema Maran atha.

23. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.

24. My love with you all in Christ Jesus.
