# Hebrews

## Hebrews 1

1. On many occasions and in many ways in the olden time, God having spoken to the fathers through the prophets, at the last of these days has spoken to us through his Son,

2. whom he put forth the heir of all things, and through whom he created the ages;

3. who being the brightness of his glory, and the character of his person, and holding up all things by the word of his power, having made purgation of the sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

4. being so much greater than the angels, that he has inherited a name so much more excellent than they.

5. For to which one of the angels at any time did he say, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be unto him a Father, and he shall be unto me a Son?

6. And again when he may lead in the first begotten into the world, he says, Indeed let all the angels of God worship him.

7. And to the angels he says, he maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire: but to the Son he says,

8. Thy throne, O God, is unto the age of the age; and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom.

9. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy comrades.

10. And thou, at the beginning, O Lord, didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.

11. These shall perish; but thou dost remain: truly all these shall wax old like a garment;

12. and thou shalt roll them up like a mantle, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail thee.

13. And to which one of the angels has he at any time said, Sit thou on my right hand, until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?

14. Are not all these ministering spirits, having been sent forth unto ministration for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation? 

## Hebrews 2

1. Therefore it behooves us the more earnestly to give heed to the things which we have heard, lest at some time we may leak out.

2. For if the word having been spoken by angels was stedfast, and every disobedience and transgression received a just recompense of reward;

3. how shall we escape, having neglected so great a salvation? which having received the beginning to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by those who heard it;

4. God at the same time witnessing, by signs and indeed by wonders, and various dynamites, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his will.

5. For he did not submit the world to come, concerning which we speak, to angels.

6. But somewhere one testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the Son of man, that thou visitest him?

7. Thou didst humiliate him somewhat comparatively with the angels; thou didst crown him with glory and honor;

8. thou didst subordinate all things beneath his feet. For in subordinating all things beneath him, he left nothing which is not subordinated beneath him.

9. But we see Jesus humiliated somewhat in comparison with the angels, having been crowned with glory and honor on account of the suffering of death, in order that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one.

10. For it became him, on account of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in leading many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering.

11. For both the one sanctifying and they who are sanctified are all of one: on account of which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,

12. saying, I will proclaim thy name to thy brethren, in the midst of the church will sing praises to thee.

13. And again, I will put my trust in him: and again; Behold, I and the children which God has given unto me.

14. Then since the children have inherited blood and flesh, he likewise also received the same, in order that through death he might set at nought him who has the power of death, that is, the devil;

15. and might reconcile them whosoever were subject to bondage all their life through the fear of death.

16. For not yet does he take upon himself the nature of angels, but he takes upon himself the seed of Abraham.

17. Therefore he ought in all things to be made like unto his brethren, in order that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things appertaining to God, to the end that he may atone for the sins of the people.

18. For in that he himself suffered being tempted, he is able to succor those who are tempted. 

## Hebrews 3

1. Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession;

2. being faithful to him who appointed him, as indeed Moses in all his house.

3. For he is esteemed worthy of more honor than Moses, inasmuch as the One having built it, has more honor than the house.

4. For every house is built by some one; and the one having built all things is God.

5. And Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, unto the testimony of those things which shall be spoken;

6. but Christ was as a son, over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold fast the boldness and rejoicing of hope firm unto the end.

7. Therefore as the Holy Spirit says, This day if you hear his voice,

8. harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,

9. whom our fathers tempted in proving me, and saw my works forty years.

10. Therefore I was provoked with this generation, and I said, They do always err in their heart: and they have not known my way,

11. as I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.

12. See, brethren, lest at some time there shall be in some one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God:

13. but exhort one another each day, while it is called to-day; in order that no one of you may be hardened with the deceitfulness of sin:

14. for we have been made partakers of Christ, if indeed we may hold fast the beginning of confidence firm unto the end.

15. In that it is said, This day if you hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation:

16. for who were those, having heard, who were hardened? yea, were they not all those having come out of Egypt under Moses?

17. And with whom was he provoked forty years? was it not with those that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

18. And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who believed not?

19. And we see that they were not able to enter in on account of their unbelief. 

## Hebrews 4

1. Then let us fear, lest at some time, the promise to enter into his rest having been left, some of you may appear to have come short.

2. For we truly have had the gospel preached unto us, as they did also: but the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith to those hearing.

3. For we who have believed, do enter into rest: as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: the works truly having been from the foundations of the world.

4. For he somewhere has spoken thus in reference to the seventh day, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.

5. And in this again he has said, They shall not enter into my rest.

6. Then since it remains that some do enter into it, and those formerly having had the gospel preached unto them did not enter in on account of unbelief,

7. again he appoints a certain day, saying in David, as has previously been said, This day, after so long a time; If you may hear his voice this day, harden not your hearts.

8. For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not speak concerning another day after these things.

9. Therefore there is a sabbatism left for the people of God.

10. For the one having entered into his rest has ceased from his works, as God did from his own.

11. Therefore let us hasten to enter into that rest, lest some one may fall by the same example of unbelief.

12. For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a quick discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

13. And no creature is hidden in his presence: but all things are naked and have been laid open to the eyes of him to whom the word is unto us.

14. Therefore having a great high priest, having entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the testimony.

15. For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched with our infirmities; but one having been tempted as to all things like unto us, apart from sin.

16. Therefore let us draw nigh with confidence to a throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace in every opportune need. 

## Hebrews 5

1. For every high priest, being received from men, presides over men in the things appertaining to God, in order that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:

2. being able to sympathize with the ignorant and erring, since himself is also compassed about with infirmity;

3. and on this account he has need, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.

4. And no one takes this honor to himself, but the one called of God, as indeed Aaron was.

5. Likewise Christ also did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but the one having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:

6. as also he says in another place, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

7. Who in the days of his flesh, having with strong crying and tears offered up both prayers and supplications unto him who is able to save him from death, and having been heard on account of his piety,

8. indeed being a Son, he learned obedience from those things which he suffered;

9. and having been made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all those who obey him;

10. having been ordained of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

11. Concerning whom there is much word to us, and difficult to speak, since you are dull of hearing.

12. For indeed you, who ought to be teachers so far as time is concerned, have need that some one again teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God; and you have need of milk, not solid food.

13. For every one partaking of milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe;

14. but solid food belongs to the perfect, those having their senses disciplined by use unto the discernment both of the good and the evil. 

## Hebrews 6

1. Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be carried to perfection; not again laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

2. of the teaching of baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

3. And we will do this, if God may permit.

4. For it is impossible that those having been once enlightened, and tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Ghost,

5. and having tasted the beautiful word of God, and the dynamites of the coming age,

6. indeed having fallen away, to renew them again unto repentance; having crucified to themselves again the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.

7. For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon her, and bringing forth the herb nutritious to those by whom it is also cultivated, receives blessings from God:

8. but that which produces thorns and thistles, is reprobate, and nigh unto the curse; whose end is unto burning.

9. But, beloved, we are persuaded better things concerning you, and things appertaining to salvation, if indeed we do thus speak.

10. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the divine love which you manifested in his name, having ministered to the saints, and ministering.

11. But we desire each one of you to exhibit the same diligence unto the full assurance of hope unto the end:

12. in order that you may not be dull, but imitators of those who through faith and longsufferings do inherit the promises.

13. For God having promised Abraham, since he had no greater one by whom to swear, swore by himself,

14. saying, If indeed blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee:

15. and thus having waited long, he received the promise.

16. For men swear by the greater: and an oath of confirmation is to them an end to all controversy:

17. but God, in this wishing more abundantly to show forth to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:

18. that through two immutable things in which it was impossible that God should lie, we who have fled may have a strong consolation to lay hold of the hope set before us,

19. which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is in the veil,

20. whither Jesus the forerunner has entered in our behalf, having been made a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. 

## Hebrews 7

1. For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, the one having met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,

2. to whom Abraham divided the tenth from all first, being interpreted, King of righteousness, and then King of Salem, which is, King of peace;

3. without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but being made like unto the Son of God, he abides a priest continually.

4. You see how great this man was, to whom the patriarch Abraham even gave the tenth part of the chief spoils.

5. And those indeed of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood have a commandment to tithe the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though having come out from the loins of Abraham:

6. but he who did not derive his lineage from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him having the promises.

7. For without contradiction the less is blessed by the better.

8. And here indeed men dying, receive tithes; however there, he is witnessed to that he lives.

9. And, so to speak a word, Levi, the one receiving tithes, has also been tithed through Abraham.

10. For he was still in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.

11. Then indeed if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for unto it the people have been tithed, what need is there still that another priest shall rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

12. For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is a change of the law.

13. For he unto whom these things were spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one ministers at the altar:

14. for it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah; in reference to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.

15. And it is still more abundantly evident, if after the similitude of Melchizedek another priest rises,

16. who was not made after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

17. For it is testified, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

18. For there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, on account of its weakness and inadequacy

19. for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God.

20. And in as much as it is without an oath, for the priests were made without an oath;

21. but He with an oath through the one saying to him, The Lord hath sworn, and will not regret it; thou art a priest forever;

22. insomuch that Jesus has also been made the mediator of a better covenant.

23. And indeed many have been made priests, because they were prohibited by death from continuing:

24. but he, because he abides forever, has an unchangeable priesthood:

25. wherefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those coming unto God through him, ever living to intercede for them.

26. For such a high priest was indeed appropriate unto us, holy, free from sin, undefiled, having been separated from the sinners, and being higher than the heavens;

27. who had not daily need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for their own sins, then those of the people: for he did this, having offered up himself once.

28. For the law institutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which is after the law, the Son, having been made perfect forever. 

## Hebrews 8

1. But in addition to the things which having been spoken this is the principal thing: We have such a high priest, who sat on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,

2. The minister of the holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man.

3. For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: whence it is necessary to have something even that which he may offer.

4. If then indeed he was on the earth, he would not be a priest, there being those offering gifts according to law,

5. whosoever serve the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses about to complete the tabernacle was commanded: for, he says, See that you shall make all things after the pattern which was shown to you in the mount:

6. but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, insomuch that he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been founded on better promises.

7. For if that first covenant had been faultless, a place would not have been sought for the second.

8. For finding fault with them, he says, Behold the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will perfect upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, a new covenant:

9. not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they abode not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord.

10. Because this is my covenant which I will establish with the house of Israel after these days, says the Lord; having given my laws in their mind, I will also write them on their heart; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be unto me a people.

11. And they shall no longer teach each one his neighbor, each one his brother, saying, Know ye the Lord: because all shall know me, from their small even unto the great.

12. Because I will be merciful unto their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.

13. In that he calls it new, he has made the first one old; but that which is old and antiquated is nigh unto vanishing. 

## Hebrews 9

1. Then indeed the first tabernacle also, had ordinances of service, and a sanctuary for this world.

2. For the first tabernacle was made; in which there were candlesticks, and the table, and shew-bread; which is called, Holy.

3. And after the second veil, was the tabernacle called Holy of holies;

4. having the golden altar, and the ark of the covenant overladen on all sides with gold, in which was the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron which budded, and the tables of the covenant;

5. and above this was the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; concerning which things it is not pertinent to speak specifically.

6. And these having been thus adjusted, the priests come continually into the first tabernacle, performing the services:

7. and into the second comes the high priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and the errors of the people;

8. the Holy Spirit showing this, the way of the holies has not yet been made manifest, the first tabernacle yet standing:

9. which is a figure unto the present time, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, not being able to make the worshiper perfect, as to his conscience;

10. consisting only in meats and drinks, and divers baptisms, ordinances of the flesh, abiding until the time of restitution.

11. But Christ being a high priest of good things to come, through a greater and a more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this world;

12. neither through the blood of goats and bullocks, but through his own blood, came once into the holies, having found eternal redemption.

13. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctifies unto the purification of the flesh;

14. how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered up himself without spot to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

15. And on this account he is mediator of the new covenant, since there being death, unto the redemption of the transgressions unto the first covenant, those having been called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

16. For where there is a covenant, it is necessary to bear the death of the covenanter;

17. for a covenant is valid in case of the dead: since it has no force while the covenanter lives.

18. Neither was the first covenant therefore dedicated without blood.

19. For every commandment having been spoken by Moses to all the people according to law, having taken the blood of bullocks and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,

20. saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God established unto you.

21. And he likewise also sprinkled the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry, with blood.

22. And according to the law, almost all things are purified by blood; and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.

23. Therefore it is necessary that the pattern of the things in these heavens be purified; and the heavenly things themselves with greater sacrifices than these.

24. For Christ did not come into the sanctuaries made with hands, the pattern of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be made manifest unto the face of God in our behalf:

25. neither in order that he may frequently offer up himself, as the high priest goes into the holies once a year with the blood of another;

26. since it behooved him frequently to suffer from the foundation of the world: but now in the end of the ages he has been made manifest unto the removal of sin through the sacrifice of himself.

27. And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this is the judgment:

28. so also Christ, having once been offered up to bear away the sins of many, will appear the second time apart from sin unto salvation to those expecting him. 

## Hebrews 10

1. For the law having the shadow of good things to come, not the real image of the things, annually with the same sacrifices which they offer continually, is by no means able to make perfect those coming to it:

2. since in that case would they not have ceased being offered, because the worshipers having once been purified would have had no more conscience of sins?

3. But in the same sacrifices there is a remembrance of sins annually;

4. for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.

5. Therefore, coming into the world, he says; Sacrifice an offering thou willest not, but thou hast perfected for me a body:

6. whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins thou wast not pleased with:

7. then I said, Lo, I come in the volume of the Book it has been written of me to do thy will, O God.

8. Saying above, that Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou didst not will, neither wast well pleased with; whatsoever are offered according to law;

9. then he has said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second;

10. by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

11. And every high priest indeed stands daily ministering, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which are never able to take away sins:

12. and he, having offered up one sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right hand of God;

13. finally waiting until his enemies may be made the foot-stool of his feet.

14. For by one offering he has forever perfected the sanctified.

15. And the Holy Ghost truly does witness to us: for afterward he said,

16. This is the covenant that I will make unto them after these days, says the Lord; having given my laws on their hearts, and I will also write them in their mind;

17. and I will remember their sins and iniquities no more.

18. But where there is removal of these, there is no more offering for sin.

19. Then, brethren, having boldness unto the entering in of the holies through the blood of Jesus,

20. by which he has opened unto us a new and living way, through the veil, that is, of his flesh,

21. and having a great high priest over the house of God;

22. let us draw nigh with a true heart in a full assurance of faith, having been sprinkled as to our hearts from an evil conscience,

23. and washed as to our body with purifying water: let us hold fast the testimony of hope steadfast; for the one having promised is faithful;

24. and let us recognize one another in the provocation of divine love and good works:

25. not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as is the custom to some; but exhorting: and this the more, as you see the days drawing nigh.

26. For we sinning willingly after we have received the perfect knowledge of the truth, there is left no more sacrifice for sins,

27. but a certain fearful anticipation of judgment and violence of fire, about to devour the adversaries.

28. The one having rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy before two or three witnesses:

29. of how much more terrible punishment, do you think, the one having trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, common, and insulted the Spirit of grace; be counted worthy!

30. For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will repay; and again, The Lord will judge his people.

31. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

32. But remember the former days, in which, you being illuminated by the Spirit, endured a great fight of afflictions;

33. both indeed in reproaches and tribulations being exposed as a theater, and having become the companions of those being thus exercised.

34. For you suffered along with the prisoners, and received with joy the spoliation of your goods, knowing that you have a better and abiding possession.

35. Therefore cast not away your confidence, which has great reward.

36. For you have need of patience, in order that, having done the will of God, you will inherit the promise.

37. For yet a little while, the one coming will come, and will not tarry.

38. My righteous man shall live by faith: and if he may draw back, my soul has no pleasure in him.

39. But we are not of the drawing back unto perdition; but of faith unto the salvation of the soul. 

## Hebrews 11

1. But faith is the confidence of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.

2. For by it the elders receive the witness of the Spirit.

3. By faith we understand that the worlds were created by the word of God, and that which was seen was not made from things which are manifest.

4. By faith Abel offered up to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he received the witness that he was righteous, God witnessing to his gifts: and through it he having died is still speaking.

5. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found because God translated him. For before he was translated he had the witness of the Spirit, that he pleased God:

6. but without faith it is impossible to please him: for it behooves the one coming unto God to believe that he is, and he is a rewarder unto them who seek him out.

7. By faith Noah, being warned concerning things not yet seen, being moved with fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his family; by which he condemned the world, and became heir to the righteousness which is according to faith.

8. By faith Abraham, being called to go out into a place which he was about to receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and went out, not knowing whither he goes.

9. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as a strange country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise:

10. for he anticipated a city having foundations, whose builder and maker is God.

11. And by faith Sarah herself received power unto the conception of seed, even past the time of age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.

12. Therefore indeed they were born of one, and those things of one having died, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sands which are by the sea, which are innumerable.

13. These all died in the faith, not having received the promises, but seeing them afar off, and embracing them, and confessing that they are strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

14. For those speaking such things declare that they are seeking after a country of their own.

15. If indeed they remember that country from which they came out, they would have had an opportunity to return;

16. but now they seek a better country, that is, a heavenly. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.

17. By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac: and the one having received the promises offered up his only begotten son,

18. in reference to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:

19. considering that God is able to raise him from the dead; whence he also received him in a figure.

20. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

21. By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, on the hilt of his staff.

22. By faith Joseph, dying, made mention concerning the exodus of the children of Israel; and commanded concerning his own bones.

23. By faith Moses, having been born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and did not fear the commandment of the king.

24. By faith Moses, having become an adult, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

25. choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season;

26. esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he was looking unto the recompense of reward.

27. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he went out, as seeing the invisible one.

28. By faith he instituted the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one destroying the first-born might not touch them.

29. By faith they pass through the Red sea as through dry land: the undertaking of which the Egyptians having entered upon were drowned.

30. By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encompassed about seven days,

31. By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, having received the spies with peace.

32. And what do I yet say? time will fail me relating concerning Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and the prophets:

33. who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,

34. obtained promises, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness became filled up with dynamite, became mighty in war, put to flight the armies of the aliens:

35. women receive their dead from a resurrection: some were tortured, not accepting deliverance; in order that they might receive a better resurrection:

36. and others received the trial of scourgings and mockings, and still of bonds and imprisonment:

37. they were stoned, they were tempted, they were burnt, they died by the edge of the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, troubled, persecuted,

38. of whom the world was not worthy; wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and caves and dens of the earth.

39. And all these, having received the witness of the spirit through faith, did not obtain the promise:

40. God having reserved something better for us, that they might not be made perfect apart from us. 

## Hebrews 12

1. Therefore let us indeed, having around us so great a cloud of witnesses, having laid aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us, run with patience the race which is set before us,

2. looking unto Jesus the beginner and perfecter of our faith; who for the joy that was placed before him, endured the cross, looking with contempt at the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.

3. For consider him who has endured so great a contradiction of sinners against himself, in order that you may not become weary, fainting in your souls.

4. For you have not yet resisted unto blood, fighting against sin;

5. and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art proven of him:

6. for whom the Lord loves he chastises, and scourges every son whom he receives.

7. Endure unto chastisement; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom the father does not chastise?

8. And if you are without chastisement, of which all have been partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.

9. Then indeed, we had fathers of our flesh who chastised us, and we endured: how much more then shall we submit to the Father of spirits, and live?

10. For they indeed for a few days were accustomed to chastise us according to that which seemed right to them; but he made unto our profit, in order that we might partake his holiness.

11. Indeed no chastisement for the present seems to be truly joyful, but sorrowful: but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who have been disciplined by it.

12. Therefore hold up the hands which hang down, and the paralyzed knees,

13. and make straight paths for your feet, in order that whatsoever is lame may not be turned out of the way, but rather may it be healed.

14. Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification, without which no one shall see the Lord:

15. looking diligently lest any one may fail from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up may trouble you, and through it many may be defiled;

16. lest any one may be a fornicator, or a profane person, as was Esau, who for one morsel sold his birthright.

17. For you know that, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance even though having sought it diligently with tears.

18. For you have not come to the mountain that can be touched, and that is burnt with fire, and unto blackness and darkness, and tempest,

19. and to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words; which those having heard requested that the word should not be spoken unto them:

20. for they could not endure that which was spoken, If a wild beast should touch the mountain, it shall be pierced through with a dart:

21. and the sight was so fearful, Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:

22. but you have come to mount Zion, and to the heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the living God, and to myriads of angels,

23. to the whole company, and to the church of the first-born, who have been written in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of justified people who have been made perfect,

24. and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking something better than the blood of Abel.

25. See that you do not reject the one speaking: for if they escape not having rejected the one delivering them the divine oracles on earth, how much more shall we not escape, who turn away from the one speaking from the heavens:

26. whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, I will still once shake not only the earth, but also heaven.

27. But he would yet once show the removal of the things shaken, as having been created, in order that the things unshaken may remain.

28. Therefore receiving an unshaken kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may worship God acceptably with reverence and fear:

29. for our God is a consuming fire. 

## Hebrews 13

1. Let brotherly love continue.

2. Forget not hospitality: for by it some having entertained angels were incognizant.

3. Remember those bound, as having been bound along with them; those suffering persecutions, as you yourselves being also in the body.

4. Marriage is honorable among all, and the couch undefiled: for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.

5. Let your deportment be free from covetousness; being content with present things: for he said, I will not, I will not, leave you, neither do I ever forsake you;

6. so being confident we say, The Lord is my helper, I will not fear; what shall man do unto me?

7. Remember your leaders, who spoke to you the word of God: the outgoing of whose deportment seeing, imitate their faith.

8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever.

9. Be not carried away with fantastical and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, in which those going round were not profited.

10. We have an altar, from which those ministering in the tabernacle have no right to eat.

11. For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is shed by the high priest in the sanctuary for sin, are utterly burnt up outside of the camp.

12. Therefore indeed Jesus, in order that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.

13. Therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach;

14. for we have here no continuing city, but we are seeking unto one which is to come.

15. Therefore let us offer to God a sacrifice of praise continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to his name.

16. But do not forget benefaction and fellowship: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

17. Obey your leaders, and be submissive: for they are watching for your souls, as they shall give an account that they may do this with joy and not with grief, for this is unprofitable to you.

18. Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, wishing in all things to deport ourselves in harmony with the beauty of holiness.

19. But I the more exhort you to do this, that I may the more speedily be restored unto you.

20. And the God of peace, the one having raised up from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great shepherd of the sheep, make you perfect, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

21. in every good thing to do his will, doing that which is acceptable in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory unto the age of the ages. Amen.

22. But I exhort you, brethren, to receive the word of consolation: for I have indeed written unto you briefly.

23. Know our brother Timothy has departed; with whom, if he may come the more speedily, I shall see you.

24. Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. Those from Italy salute you.

25. Grace be with you all.
