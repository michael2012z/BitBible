# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, the servant of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God, and the perfect knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,

2. in the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie, promised before the eternal times,

3. and manifested in his own seasons his word by preaching, with which I am intrusted, according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

4. to Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Saviour.

5. Therefore I left you in Crete, in order that you may set in order remaining things, and establish elders in every city, as I commanded you;

6. if any one is irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of riot or incorrigible.

7. For it behooves the bishop to be blameless, as the steward of God; not audacious, not irascible, not given to wine, not a controvertist, not fond of filthy lucre;

8. but hospitable, loving the good, prudent, righteous, holy, temperate;

9. holding that which is according to the teaching of the faithful word, in order that he may be able both to exhort with healthy teaching, and to convict the opposers.

10. For many are incorrigible, speaking vain things and egotistical, especially those from the circumcision,

11. whose mouths it is necessary to stop; who overturn whole families, teaching those things which it does not behoove, for the sake of disgraceful gain.

12. A certain one of them, their own prophet, said, The Cretans are all liars, evil beasts, slow stomachs.

13. This testimony is true: on account of which cause convict them sharply, in order that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men turning away from the truth.

15. To the pure all things are pure: but to the corrupted and unbelieving there is nothing pure; yea, their mind and their conscience are polluted.

16. They profess to know God, but deny him by their works, being abominable, and unbelieving, and reprobate unto every good work. 

## Titus 2

1. But speak you those things which become healthy teaching.

2. That the elderly men be sober, grave, prudent, sound in faith, in divine love, in patience:

3. likewise that the elderly women be reverent in demeanor, not tattlers, not given to much wine, teachers of that which is good;

4. in order that they instruct the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,

5. to be prudent, chaste, domestic, good, submissive to their own husbands, in order that the word of God may not be blasphemed.

6. Likewise exhort the young men to be prudent:

7. concerning all things exhibiting yourself an example of good works; in teaching; purity, gravity,

8. the sound word, irrefutable, in order that the adversary may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning us.

9. That servants submit to their own masters, that they be obedient in all things; not speaking back;

10. not purloining, but exhibiting all good faith, that they may adorn the teaching of God our Saviour in all things.

11. For the grace of God, that brings salvation to all men, has appeared,

12. teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we must live prudently and righteously and holily in this present age;

13. looking for the blessed hope even the appearing of the glory of our great God and our Saviour Christ Jesus;

14. who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

15. Speak these things and exhort and convict with all authority; let no one despise thee. 

## Titus 3

1. Remind them to submit to the governments, authorities, to obey the rule over them, to be ready unto every good work,

2. to speak evil of no one, that they should be peaceable, gentle, showing all meekness to all men.

3. For when we also were without understanding, being disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in sin and envy, hateful, hating one another;

4. but when the goodness and philanthropy of God our Saviour appeared,

5. not from works which are in righteousness, which we did, but according to his own mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewal of the Holy Ghost,

6. whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

7. in order that, being justified by his faith, we may be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. The word is faithful, and I wish you to be established concerning these things, in order that those having believed in God may think to excel in good works. These things are beautiful and useful to the people:

9. but reject foolish questions, and genealogies, and strife, and controversies about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. Reject a heretical man after the first and second admonition;

11. knowing that such an one is turned away, and is sinning, being self-condemned.

12. When I shall send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis: for I have determined to spend the winter there.

13. Send on Zenas the lawyer and Apollos speedily, in order that nothing may be lacking to them.

14. And let our people indeed learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, in order that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All who are with me salute you. Salute those who love us with the love of friendship in the faith. Grace be with you all.
