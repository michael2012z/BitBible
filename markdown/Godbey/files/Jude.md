# Jude

## Jude 1

1. Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the called beloved in God the Father, and kept in Jesus Christ.

2. Mercy to you, and peace, and divine love be multiplied.

3. Beloved, making all haste to write to you concerning our common salvation, I had need to write to you, exhorting you to agonize for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

4. For certain men have crept in, who long ago were written down to this judgment, ungodly, transforming the grace of God into impurity, even denying Jesus Christ, our only Sovereign and Lord.

5. But I wish you to remember, once having known all these things, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, destroyed them that believed riot, the second time:

6. and the angels who kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, has he kept in eternal chains unto darkness unto the judgment of the great day:

7. as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, in a manner like unto them committing fornication, and going after other flesh, present an example receiving the vengeance of eternal fire.

8. Likewise indeed these dreamers also pollute the flesh, and reject lordship, and blaspheme glories.

9. But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring against him a judgment of blasphemy, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

10. But these blaspheme so many things as they know not: and so many things as they understand naturally, like irrational animals, in these they are corrupted.

11. Woe unto them! because they have gone off in the way of Cain, and in the delusion of Balaam they have been seduced by reward, and they perished in the gainsaying of Korah.

12. These are rocks in your love-feasts, feasting along with you without fear shepherdizing themselves, clouds without water, driven away by the winds; withered trees, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

13. wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own disgraces; wandering stars, for which the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.

14. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied against these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with his myriads of saints,

15. to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly of them for all the works of their ungodliness which they have impiously done, and for all their hard speeches which they have spoken against him, being ungodly sinners.

16. These are querulous grumblers, going forth according to their own lusts; and their mouth speaking swelling words, admiring persons for the sake of gain.

17. But you, beloved, remember the words which have hitherto been spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

18. that they said to you, At the last time there will be mockers, walking according to their own lusts after ungodly things.

19. These are they who are sidetracking [the people], intellectual, not having the Spirit.

20. But you, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

21. keep yourselves in the divine love of God, receiving the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

22. And some of whom indeed convict, being judged:

23. and some save, seizing them out of the fire; and some pity in their fear, you indeed hating the garment having been spotted by carnality.

24. But to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to establish you blameless in the presence of his glory with rejoicing.

25. to God our only Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and power, before every age, both now, and unto all the ages. Amen.
