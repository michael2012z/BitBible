## Proverbs 1

1. THE PROVERBS of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

2. To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the words of understanding;

3. To receive the discipline of wisdom, justice, and right, and equity;

4. To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion;

5. That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, and the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels;

6. To understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

7. The fear of HaShem is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and discipline.

8. Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;

9. For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.

10. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

11. If they say: 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk for the innocent without cause;

12. Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;

13. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil;

14. Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse'--

15. My son, walk not thou in the way with them, restrain thy foot from their path;

16. For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.

17. For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird;

18. And these lie in wait for their own blood, they lurk for their own lives.

19. So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

20. Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, she uttereth her voice in the broad places;

21. She calleth at the head of the noisy streets, at the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:

22. 'How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness? And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

24. Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended,

25. But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof;

26. I also, in your calamity, will laugh, I will mock when your dread cometh;

27. When your dread cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when trouble and distress come upon you.

28. Then will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me.

29. For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of HaShem;

30. They would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof.

31. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

32. For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, and the confidence of fools shall destroy them.

33. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.' 

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee;

2. So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, and thy heart incline to discernment;

3. Yea, if thou call for understanding, and lift up thy voice for discernment;

4. If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;

5. Then shalt thou understand the fear of HaShem, and find the knowledge of G-d.

6. For HaShem giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;

7. He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;

8. That He may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of His godly ones.

9. Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equity, yea, every good path.

10. For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;

11. Discretion shall watch over thee, discernment shall guard thee;

12. To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things;

13. Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;

14. Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil;

15. Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths;

16. To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words;

17. That forsaketh the lord of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her G-d.

18. For her house sinketh down unto death, and her paths unto the shades;

19. None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life;

20. That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.

21. For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the whole-hearted shall remain in it.

22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the faithless shall be plucked up out of it. 

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, forget not my teaching; but let thy heart keep my commandments;

2. For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to thee.

3. Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart;

4. So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of G-d and man.

5. Trust in HaShem with all thy heart, and lean not upon thine own understanding.

6. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths.

7. Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear HaShem, and depart from evil;

8. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

9. Honour HaShem with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;

10. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.

11. My son, despise not the chastening of HaShem, neither spurn thou His correction;

12. For whom HaShem loveth He correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.

13. Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that obtaineth understanding.

14. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

15. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honour.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

18. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that holdest her fast.

19. HaShem by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens.

20. By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.

21. My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion;

22. So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

23. Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thou shalt not dash thy foot.

24. When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid; yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

25. Be not afraid of sudden terror, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;

26. For HaShem will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being caught.

27. Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.

28. Say not unto thy neighbour: 'Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give'; when thou hast it by thee.

29. Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.

30. Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

31. Envy thou not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.

32. For the perverse is an abomination to HaShem; but His counsel is with the upright.

33. The curse of HaShem is in the house of the wicked; but He blesseth the habitation of the righteous.

34. If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, but unto the humble He giveth grace.

35. The wise shall inherit honour; but as for the fools, they carry away shame. 

## Proverbs 4

1. Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.

2. For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my teaching.

3. For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.

4. And he taught me, and said unto me: 'Let thy heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments, and live;

5. Get wisdom, get understanding; forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;

6. Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; love her, and she will keep thee.

7. The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom; yea, with all thy getting get understanding.

8. Extol her, and she will exalt thee; she will bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.

9. She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; a crown of glory will she bestow on thee.'

10. Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.

11. I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.

12. When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened; and if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go; keep her, for she is thy life.

14. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.

15. Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on.

16. For they sleep not, except they have done evil; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.

19. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.

20. My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

21. Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.

22. For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.

23. Above all that thou guardest keep thy heart; for out of it are the issues of life.

24. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.

25. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.

26. Make plain the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.

27. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil. 

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, attend unto my wisdom; incline thine ear to my understanding;

2. That thou mayest preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.

3. For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;

4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on the nether-world;

6. Lest she should walk the even path of life, her ways wander, but she knoweth it not.

7. Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.

8. Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house;

9. Lest thou give thy vigour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;

10. Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in the house of an alien;

11. And thou moan, when thine end cometh, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

12. And say: 'How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;

13. Neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!

14. I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.'

15. Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.

16. Let thy springs be dispersed abroad, and courses of water in the streets.

17. Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

18. Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth.

19. A lovely hind and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; with her love be thou ravished always.

20. Why then wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of an alien?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of HaShem, and He maketh even all his paths.

22. His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.

23. He shall die for lack of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall reel. 

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast struck thy hands for a stranger--

2. Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth, thou art caught by the words of thy mouth--

3. Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and urge thy neighbour.

4. Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

5. Deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise;

7. Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,

8. Provideth her bread in the summer, and gatherest her food in the harvest.

9. How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

10. 'Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep'--

11. So shall thy poverty come as a runner, and thy want as an armed man.

12. A base person, a man of iniquity, is he that walketh with a froward mouth;

13. That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet, that pointeth with his fingers;

14. Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord.

15. Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.

16. There are six things which HaShem hateth, yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him:

17. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;

18. A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to evil;

19. A false witness that breatheth out lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

20. My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;

21. Bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck.

22. When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

23. For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life;

24. To keep thee from the evil woman, from the smoothness of the alien tongue.

25. Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her captivate thee with her eyelids.

26. For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread, but the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.

27. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

28. Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?

29. So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.

30. Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

31. But if he be found, he must restore sevenfold, he must give all the substance of his house.

32. He that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he doeth it that would destroy his own soul.

33. Wounds and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

34. For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

35. He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. 

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

2. Keep my commandments and live, and my teaching as the apple of thine eye.

3. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart.

4. Say unto wisdom: 'Thou art my sister', and call understanding thy kinswoman;

5. That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words.

6. For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;

7. And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,

8. Passing through the street near her corner, and he went the way to her house;

9. In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.

10. And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.

11. She is riotous and rebellious, her feet abide not in her house;

12. Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner.

13. So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said unto him:

14. 'Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me; this day have I paid my vows.

15. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

16. I have decked my couch with coverlets, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.

17. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves.

19. For my husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey;

20. He hath taken the bag of money with him; he will come home at the full moon.'

21. With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield, with the blandishment of her lips she enticeth him away.

22. He goeth after her straightway, as an ox that goeth to the slaughter, or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;

23. Till an arrow strike through his liver; as a bird hasteneth to the snare-- and knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life.

24. Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.

25. Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

26. For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, a mighty host are all her slain.

27. Her house is the way to the nether-world, going down to the chambers of death. 

## Proverbs 8

1. Doth not wisdom call, and understanding put forth her voice?

2. In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth;

3. Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:

4. 'Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.

5. O ye thoughtless, understand prudence, and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.

6. Hear, for I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.

7. For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, there is nothing perverse or crooked in them.

9. They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than rubies, and all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.

12. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of devices.

13. The fear of HaShem is to hate evil; pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

14. Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.

15. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

16. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

17. I love them that love me, and those that seek me earnestly shall find me.

18. Riches and honour are with me; yea, enduring riches and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my produce than choice silver.

20. I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;

21. That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.

22. HaShem made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old.

23. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.

24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.

25. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth;

26. While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.

27. When He established the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle upon the face of the deep,

28. When He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep showed their might,

29. When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He appointed the foundations of the earth;

30. Then I was by Him, as a nursling; and I was daily all delight, playing always before Him,

31. Playing in His habitable earth, and my delights are with the sons of men.

32. Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; for happy are they that keep my ways.

33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

34. Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

35. For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of HaShem.

36. But he that misseth me wrongeth his own soul; all they that hate me love death.' 

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;

2. She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.

3. She hath sent forth her maidens, she calleth, upon the highest places of the city:

4. 'Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither'; as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:

5. 'Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

6. Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live; and walk in the way of understanding.

7. He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame, and he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot.

8. Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.

9. Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.

10. The fear of HaShem is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding.

11. For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

12. If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.'

13. The woman Folly is riotous; she is thoughtless, and knoweth nothing.

14. And she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

15. To call to them that pass by, who go right on their ways:

16. 'Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither'; and as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:

17. 'Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.'

18. But he knoweth not that the shades are there; that her guests are in the depths of the nether-world.

16. The wages of the righteous is life; the increase of the wicked is sin.

17. He is in the way of life that heedeth instruction; but he that forsaketh reproof erreth.

18. He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; and he that uttereth a slander is a fool.

19. In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; but he that refraineth his lips is wise.
