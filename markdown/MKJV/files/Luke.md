# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Since many took in hand to draw up an account concerning the matters which have been borne out among us,

2. even as those who from the beginning delivered to us, becoming eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,

3. it seemed good to me also, following all things accurately from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,

4. so that you might know the certainty of those things in which you have been instructed.   

5. In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

7. And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren. And both were advanced in their days.

8. And it happened in his serving in the order of his course, before God,

9. according to the custom of the priests, it was his lot to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

10. And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.

11. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him as he was standing on the right of the altar of incense.

12. And seeing this, Zacharias was troubled, and fear fell on him.

13. But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias. For your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.

14. And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall neither drink wine nor strong drink. And he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

16. And he shall turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.

17. And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am old, and my wife is advanced in her days.

19. And answering, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God. And I am sent to speak to you and to show you these glad tidings.

20. And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their time.

21. And the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he stayed so long in the temple.

22. And when he came out, he could not speak to them. And they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and remained speechless.

23. And as soon as the days of his service were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

24. And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying,

25. So the Lord has dealt with me in the days in which He looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.   

26. And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

27. to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.

28. And the angel came in to her and said, Hail, one receiving grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women.

29. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered what kind of greeting this might be.

30. And the angel said to her, Do not fear, Mary, for you have found favor with God.

31. And behold! You shall conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS.

32. He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.

33. And He shall reign over the house of David forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.

34. Then Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I do not know a man?

35. And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you. Therefore also that Holy One which will be born of you shall be called Son of God.

36. And behold, your cousin Elizabeth also conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

37. For with God nothing shall be impossible.

38. And Mary said, Behold the servant of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.   

39. And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah.

40. And she entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.

41. And it happened as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,

42. and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

43. And from where is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For lo, as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

45. And blessed is she who believes, for there shall be a perfecting of those things which were told her from the Lord.

46. And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.

48. For He looked on the humiliation of His slave woman. For, behold, from now on all generations shall count me blessed.

49. For the Mighty One has done great things for me; and holy is His name.

50. And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.

51. He has worked power with His arm, He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.

52. He has put down rulers from their seats and exalted the lowly,

53. He has filled the hungry with good things, and He has sent away the rich empty.

54. He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,

55. as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.

56. And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her own house.   

57. And the time was fulfilled to Elizabeth for her to bear. And she bore a son.

58. And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard how the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.

59. And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it Zacharias, after his father's name.

60. And his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.

62. And they made signs to his father as to how he would have him called.

63. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.

64. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosened. And he spoke and praised God.

65. And fear came on all who lived all around them. And all these things were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.

66. And all those who heard laid them up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.   

67. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people

69. and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,

70. as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from eternity;

71. that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,

72. to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,

73.  the oath which He swore to our father Abraham,

74. that He would grant to us, that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear

75. in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.

76. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest, for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,

77. to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,

78. through the tender mercy of our God; by which the Dayspring from on high has visited us,

79. to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

80. And the child grew and became strong in spirit and was in the deserts until the day of his showing to Israel.  

## Luke 2

1. And it happened in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

2. (This taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

3. And all went to be registered, each to his own city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee to be taxed (out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David).

5. And he took Mary his betrothed wife, being with child.

6. And while they were there, the days for her deliverance were fulfilled.

7. And she brought forth her son, the First-born, and wrapped Him, and laid Him in a manger-- because there was no room for them in the inn.   

8. And in the same country there were shepherds living in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

9. And lo, the angel of the Lord came on them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. And they were grievously afraid.

10. And the angel said to them, Do not fear. For behold, I give to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

11. For to you is born today, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

12. And this is a sign to you. You will find the babe wrapped, lying in a manger.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,

14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

15. And it happened as the angels departed from them into Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Indeed, let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing which has happened, which the Lord made known to us.

16. And hurrying they came and sought out both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.

17. And seeing, they publicly told about the word spoken to them concerning this Child.

18. And all those who heard marveled about the things spoken to them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary kept all these sayings, meditating in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as was spoken to them.   

21. And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child, His name was called JESUS, the name called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord

23. (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)

24. and to offer a sacrifice according to that said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.   

25. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was on him.

26. And it happened to him, being instructed by the Holy Spirit, he was not to see death before he would see the Christ of the Lord.

27. And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And as the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,

28. even he received Him in his arms and blessed God, and said,

29. Lord, now You will let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word.

30. For my eyes have seen Your Salvation

31. which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples,

32. a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of Your people Israel.

33. And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken by him.

34. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against

35. (yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in many days, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.

37. And she was a widow of eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.

38. And she coming in at that instant gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of Him to all those in Jerusalem eagerly expecting redemption.

39. And when they had finished all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was on Him.   

41. And His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.

42. And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast.

43. And fulfilling the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know.

44. But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey. And they looked for Him among the kinsfolk and acquaintances.

45. And when they did not find Him, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking Him.

46. And it happened that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.

47. And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.

48. And seeing Him, they were amazed. And His mother said to Him, Child, why have you done so to us? Behold, your father and I have looked for you, greatly distressed.

49. And He said to them, Why did you look for Me? Do you not know that I must be about My Father's business?

50. And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.

51. And He went with them and came to Nazareth, and He was subject to them. But His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.  

## Luke 3

1. And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the Trachonitus country, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene--

2. Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests-- the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3. And he came into all the country around Jordan, proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,

4. as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, " The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.

5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth.

6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God."

7. Then he said to the crowd that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.

9. And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.

10. And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

11. He answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. And he who has food, let him do likewise.

12. And tax-collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them, Continue to do no more than that commanded to you.

14. And the soldiers also asked of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not oppress anyone, nor accuse any falsely. And be content with your wages.   

15. And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, lest perhaps he was the Christ,

16. John answered all, saying, I indeed baptize you with water, but He who is mightier than I comes, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,

17. whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor and will gather the wheat into His storehouse. But He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.

18. And then indeed exhorting many things, he proclaimed the gospel to the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch (being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done)

20. added still this above all, that he even shut John up in prison.   

21. And it happened in the baptizing of all the people, Jesus also being baptized, and praying, and the heaven was opened.

22. And the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily shape, like a dove on Him. And a voice came from Heaven, which said, You are My Son, the Beloved; I am delighted in You.

23. And Jesus Himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) son of Joseph, son of of Heli,

24.  son of of Matthat, son of of Levi, son of of Melchi, son of of Janna, son of of Joseph,

25.  son of of Mattathias, son of of Amos, son of of Nahum, son of of Esli, son of of Naggai,

26.  son of of Maath, son of of Mattathias, son of of Semei, son of of Joseph, son of of Juda,

27.  son of of Joanna, son of of Rhesa, son of of Zerubbabel, son of of Shealtiel, son of of Neri,

28.  son of of Melchi, son of of Addi, son of of Cosam, son of of Elmodam, son of of Er,

29.  son of of Joses, son of of Eliezer, son of of Jorum, son of of Matthat, son of of Levi,

30.  son of of Simeon, son of of Juda, son of of Joseph, son of of Jonan, son of of Eliakim,

31.  son of of Melea, the son of Menan, son of of Mattatha, son of of Nathan, son of of David,

32.  son of of Jesse, son of of Obed, son of of Boaz, son of of Salma, son of of Nahshon,

33.  son of of Amminadab, son of of Ram, son of of Hezron, son of of Pharez, son of of Judah,

34.  son of of Jacob, son of of Isaac, son of of Abraham, son of of Terah, son of of Nahor,

35.  son of of Serug, son of of Reu, son of of Peleg, son of of Eber, son of of Shelah,

36.  son of of Cainan, son of of Arphaxad, son of of Shem, son of of Noah, son of of Lamech,

37.  son of of Methuselah, son of of Enoch, son of of Jared, son of of Mahalaleel, son of of Cainan,

38.  son of of Enos, son of of Seth, son of of Adam, son of of God.  

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness

2. forty days, being tempted by the Devil. And in those days He ate nothing. And they being ended, He afterward was hungry.

3. And the Devil said to Him, If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it might become bread.

4. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."

5. And the Devil, leading Him up into a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the Devil said to Him, All this power I will give you, and the glory of them; for it has been delivered to me. And I give it to whomever I will.

7. Therefore if you will worship me, all shall be yours.

8. And Jesus answered and said to him, Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve."

9. And he brought Him to Jerusalem and sat Him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to Him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here.

10. For it is written, "He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You;

11. and in their hands they shall bear You up, lest at any time You dash Your foot against a stone."

12. And Jesus answering said to him, It has been said, "You shall not tempt the Lord your God."

13. And when the Devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him for a time.   

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And a report went out throughout all the neighborhood concerning Him.

15. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16. And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And, as His custom was, He went in to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.

17. And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And unrolling the book, He found the place where it was written,

18. "The Spirit of the Lord is on Me; because of this He has anointed Me to proclaim the Gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and new sight to  the blind, to set at liberty those having been crushed,

19. to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."

20. And rolling up the book, returning it to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.

21. And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.

22. And all bore witness to Him and wondered at the gracious words which came out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not Joseph's son?

23. And He said to them, You will surely say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your native-place.

24. And He said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his native-place.

25. But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land.

26. But Elijah was not sent to any of them, except to Zarephath, a city of Sidon, to a woman, a widow.

27. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.

28. And hearing these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.

29. And they rose up and thrust Him outside the city, and led Him up to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.

30. But passing through the midst of them, He went away.   

31. And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.

32. And they were astonished at His doctrine, for His word was with authority.

33. And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon and cried out with a loud voice,

34. saying, Let us alone! What is to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into the midst, he came out of him, not harming him.

36. And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.

37. And a report about Him went out into every place of the neighborhood.

38. And rising up from the synagogue, He entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was being seized with a great fever. And they asked Him for her.

39. And standing over her, He rebuked the fever. And it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.

40. And the sun sinking, all, as many as had sick ones with different kinds of diseases brought them to Him. And laying hands on each of them, He healed them.

41. And also demons came out of many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And rebuking them, He did not allow them to speak; for they knew Him to be the Christ.

42. And day coming on, going out, He went into a deserted place. And the crowds looked for Him and came to Him, and held Him fast, not to pass away from them.

43. And He said to them, I must proclaim the gospel, the kingdom of God, to other cities, because I was sent on this mission,

44. And He proclaimed in the synagogues of Galilee.  

## Luke 5

1. And it happened that the crowd pressed on Him to hear the word of God, He stood by the lake of Gennesaret.

2. And He saw two boats standing by the lake. But the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.

3. And He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, He asked him to thrust out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the people out of the boat.

4. And as He stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let your nets down for a haul.

5. And answering, Simon said to Him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. Yet at Your word I will let down the net.

6. And doing this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish. And their net was being torn.

7. And they signaled the partners, those in the other boat, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.

8. And seeing, Simon Peter fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.

9. For he and all who were with him were astonished at the haul of fish which they had taken,

10. and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear, from now on you will be taking men alive.

11. And bringing their boats onto land, forsaking all things, they followed Him.   

12. And it happened, as He was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy! And seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You will, You can cleanse me.

13. And stretching out the hand, He touched him, saying, I will! Be clean! And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And He commanded him, Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

15. But the word about Him spread even more. And great crowds were coming to hear, and to be healed from their infirmities by Him.

16. But He was drawing back in the wilderness, and praying.   

17. And it happened on one of the days, even He was teaching. And Pharisees and teachers of the Law were sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was there, for the curing of them.

18. And behold, men carrying, on a cot, a man who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in and to lay him before Him.

19. And not finding a way by which they might bring him in through the crowd, going up on the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst, before Jesus.

20. And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.

21. And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?

22. But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?

24. But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic, I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot and go to your house.

25. And immediately he rose up before them and took up that on which he lay. And he departed to his own house, glorifying God.

26. And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We saw wonderful things today.   

27. And after these things He went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi, sitting at the tax-office. And He said to him, Follow Me.

28. And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.

29. And Levi made a great feast in his own house for Him. And there was a great company of tax-collectors and of others who were reclining with them.

30. But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax-collectors and sinners?

31. And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are sound do not need a physician, but those who are sick.

32. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.

33. And they said to Him, Why do John's disciples fast often and make prayers, and also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?

34. But He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.

36. And He also spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment on an old garment. Otherwise, both the new will tear, and the old does not match the piece from the new.

37. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskin will perish.

38. But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.

39. Also no one having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, The old is better.  

## Luke 6

1. And it happened on the second chief sabbath, He went through the grain fields. And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.

2. And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

3. And answering, Jesus said to them, Have you not read this, what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him;

4. how he went into the house of God and took the showbread, and ate (and also gave to those who were with him) which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests alone?

5. And He said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

6. And it happened, also on another sabbath, that He entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and Pharisees watched him to see if He would heal on the sabbath day, so that they might find an accusation against Him.

8. But He knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.

9. Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil, to save life, or to destroy it?

10. And looking around on them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he did so. And his hand was restored whole like the other.

11. And they were filled with madness, and talked with one another as to what they might do to Jesus.   

12. And it happened in those days that He went out into a mountain to pray, and He was spending the night in prayer to God.

13. And when it was day, He called His disciples. And He chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles:

14. Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;

15. Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who was called Zelotes;

16. Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became the betrayer.

17. And coming down with them, He stood on a level place. And a crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon (who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases) were there;

18. also those tormented by unclean spirits; and they were healed.

19. And all the crowd sought to touch Him, for power went out of Him and healed them all.   

20. And lifting up His eyes to His disciples, He said, Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

21. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.

22. Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall cut you off, and when they shall reproach you and shall cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.

23. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For behold, your reward is great in Heaven. For so their fathers did according to these things to the prophets.

24. But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.

25. Woe to you who are full! For you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! For you shall mourn and weep.

26. Woe to you when all men shall speak well of you! For so their fathers did to the false prophets.   

27. But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,

28. bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.

29. And to him who strikes you on the one cheek, also offer the other. And to him who takes away your garment, do not forbid your tunic also.

30. Give to everyone who asks of you, and from him who takes away your goods, do not ask them again.

31. And as you desire that men should do to you, you do also to them likewise.

32. For if you love those who love you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also love those who love them.

33. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also do the same.

34. And if you lend to those of whom you hope to receive, what thanks do you have? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

35. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return. And your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest. For He is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.

36. Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.   

37. Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.

38. Give, and it shall be given to you, good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over, they shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you measure, it shall be measured to you again.

39. And He spoke a parable to them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?

40. The disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is perfect shall be like his master.

41. And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brother's eye, but do not see the beam that is in your own eye?

42. Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the splinter in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your brother's eye.

43. For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.

45. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good. And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth the evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.

46. And why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?

47. Whoever comes to Me and hears My words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.

48. He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock; and a flood occurring, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.

49. But he who hears and does not perform, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.  

## Luke 7

1. And when He had ended all His words in the ears of the people, He entered into Capernaum.

2. And a certain servant of a centurion who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.

3. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to Him, begging Him that He would come and heal his servant.

4. And coming to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that he was worthy, he for whom You give this;

5. for, they said, He loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.

6. Then Jesus went with them. But He being yet not far off from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself. For I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.

7. Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to You; but say a word, and my servant will be healed.

8. For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

9. And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I have not found such faith, no, not in Israel.

10. And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the sick servant well.   

11. And it happened on the next day, He went into a city called Nain. And many of His disciples and a great crowd went with Him.

12. And drawing near the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.

13. And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.

14. And He came and touched the bier. And the ones who bore him stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!

15. And the one who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He delivered him to his mother.

16. And fear came on all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.

17. And this report of Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.

18. And his disciples reported all these things to John.   

19. And John, calling near a certain two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are You He that should come, or do we look for another?

20. And coming to Him, the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, Are You He who should come, or do we look for another?

21. And in the same hour He cured many of infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits. And He gave sight to many who were blind.

22. And answering, Jesus said to them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is proclaimed to the poor.

23. And blessed is he who shall not be offended in Me.

24. And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the people concerning John. What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

25. But what did you go out to see? A man clothed with soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in kings' palaces.

26. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he of whom it is written, "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You."

28. For I say to you, Among those who are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

29. And all the people and the tax-collectors who heard Him justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being baptized by him.

31. And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you did not weep.

33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.

34. The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!

35. But wisdom has been justified by all her children.   

36. And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.

37. And behold, a woman, a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment.

38. And she stood behind Him, weeping at His feet, and she began to wash His feet with tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. And she ardently kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment.

39. But seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited Him, spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, for she is a sinner.

40. And answering, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, speak.

41. There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

42. And they having nothing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do you say will love him most?

43. And answering, Simon said, I suppose that one to whom he forgave most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.

44. And He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, yet you gave Me no water for My feet. But she has washed My feet with tears, and has wiped them with the hair of her head.

45. You gave Me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.

46. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.

47. Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.

48. And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.

49. And those reclining with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?

50. And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.  

## Luke 8

1. And it happened afterwards, He traveled in every city and village, proclaiming and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with Him,

2. and also certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,

3. and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to Him of their possessions.   

4. And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke by a parable:

5. A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, the one fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And other fell on a rock, and sprouting, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.

7. And other fell amidst thorns, and springing up with the thorns, they choked it.

8. And other fell on good ground and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when He had said these things, He cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?

10. And He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to others I speak in parables, so that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.

11. And the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.

12. Those by the roadside are the ones who hear; then the Devil comes and takes the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

13. Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy. And these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

14. And those which fell among thorns are the ones who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bear to maturity.

15. But those on the good ground are the ones who, in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.

16. And no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch; but he sets it on a lampstand so that those who enter in may see the light.

17. For nothing is secret that shall not be revealed; nor secret which shall not be known and come to be revealed.

18. Therefore be careful how you hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.

19. And His mother and His brothers came to Him. And they could not come near Him because of the crowd.

20. And it was told to Him by some, who said, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside desiring to see You.

21. And He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are those who hear the Word of God and do it.   

22. And it happened on a certain day that He went into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.

23. But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake. And they were being filled with water and were in jeopardy.

24. And they came to Him and awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!

26. And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.

27. And He going out onto land, He met a certain man out of the city, who had had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, nor stayed in a house, but among the tombs.

28. And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him and said with a loud voice, What is to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beseech You, Do not torment me!

29. (For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had seized him. And he had been kept bound in chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven into the deserted places by the demons.)

30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.

31. And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.

32. And there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into them. And He allowed them.

33. And coming out of the man, the demons entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.

34. And those feeding the pigs, and seeing the thing, fled. And leaving, they reported to the city and to the farms.

35. And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had departed sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.

36. Also those who saw it told them how the demon-possessed one was healed.

37. And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear, and asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.

38. And the man out of whom the demons had gone out begged Him, desiring to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. Return to your own house and declare what God has done to you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout all the city what great things Jesus had done to him.   

40. And it happened when Jesus had returned, the people received Him. For they were all waiting for Him.

41. And behold, a man named Jairus came, and he was a synagogue-ruler. And he fell down at Jesus' feet and begged Him that He would come into his house.

42. For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as He went, the people thronged Him.

43. And a woman who had a flow of blood twelve years (who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any)

44. came behind Him and touched the border of His garment. And instantly her flow of blood was staunched.

45. And Jesus said, Who touched Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowd presses and jostles You, and You say, Who touched Me?

46. And Jesus said, Someone has touched Me, for I know that power has gone out of Me.

47. And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling. And falling down before Him, she declared to Him before all the people why she had touched Him, and how she was instantly healed.

48. And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has saved you; go in peace.

49. He was still speaking when someone came from the synagogue-ruler, saying to him, Your daughter is dead, do not trouble the Teacher.

50. But when Jesus heard, He answered Him, saying, Do not fear, only believe and she shall be healed.

51. And coming into the house, He allowed no one to go in, except Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the girl.

52. And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but sleeps.

53. And they ridiculed, knowing that she was dead.

54. And He put them all out. And He took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise!

55. And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that food be given her to eat.

56. And her parents were astonished. But He charged them to tell no one the thing that happened.  

## Luke 9

1. And He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.

2. And He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

3. And He said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staffs, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor each to have two tunics.

4. And whatever house you enter into, abide there and depart from there.

5. And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

6. And they departed and went through the towns, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere.

7. And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things happening by Him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead;

8. and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets had risen again.

9. And Herod said, John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see Him.   

10. And returning, the apostles told Him all that they had done. And He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.

11. But knowing this, the crowds followed Him. And He received them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and He healed those who had need of healing.

12. But the day began to wear away, and coming up the Twelve said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and farms all around, and lodge, and get food. For we are here in a deserted place.

13. But He said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.

14. (For they were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, Make them recline by fifties in a company.

15. And they did so, and made them all recline.

16. And He took the five loaves and the two fish. And looking up to Heaven, He blessed them and broke, and He gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.

17. And they ate and were all filled. And there was taken up twelve hand baskets full of fragments of that left over to them.   

18. And it happened as He was alone praying, the disciples were with Him. And He asked them, saying, Whom do the crowds say that I am?

19. Answering, they said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah, and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.

20. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Answering, Peter said, The Christ of God.

21. And He strictly charged them and commanded to tell no one this,

22. saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.

23. And He said to all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.

24. For whoever will save his life shall lose it, but whoever will lose his life for My sake, he shall save it.

25. For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world and loses himself, or is cast away?

26. For whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, the Son of man shall be ashamed of him when He shall come in His own and in His Father's glory, and that of the holy angels.

27. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.   

28. And about eight days after these sayings, He took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray.

29. And as He prayed, the appearance of His countenance was altered, and His clothing was dazzling white.

30. And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,

31. who appeared in glory and spoke of His exodus, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep. But fully awakening, they saw His glory, and the two men who stood with Him.

33. And in their parting from Him, it happened that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.

34. And as he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them. And they feared as they entered into the cloud.

35. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, hear Him.

36. And when the voice occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and told no one in those days anything which they had seen.   

37. And it happened on the next day, they coming down from the mountain, a huge crowd met Him.

38. And behold, a man cried aloud from the crowd, saying, Teacher, I beseech You, look on my son, for he is my only-born son.

39. And lo, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out. And it throws him into convulsions, with foaming, and with pain departs from him, bruising him.

40. And I begged Your disciples to cast him out, and they could not.

41. And answering, Jesus said, O unbelieving generation, one having been perverted, how long shall I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.

42. And as he was still coming, the demon violently convulsed and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father.   

43. And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But as all were marveling at all things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,

44. Let these words sink down into your ears. For the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men.

45. But they did not understand this thing, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it. And they feared to ask Him of this word.

46. And an argument came in among them, who might be the greater of them.

47. And seeing the argument of their heart, Jesus took a child and set him beside Him.

48. And He said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in My name receives Me. And whoever shall receive Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all, he shall be great.

49. And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in Your name. And we prevented him, because he does not follow us.

50. And Jesus said to him, Do not prevent him, for he who is not against us is for us.   

51. And it happened in the fulfilling of the days of His taking up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.

52. And He sent messengers before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.

53. And they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.

54. And seeing, His disciples James and John said, Lord, do You desire that we command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?

55. But He turned and rebuked them and said, You do not know of what spirit you are.

56. For the Son of man has not come to destroy men's lives, but to save. And they went to another village.   

57. And it happened as they were going in the way, one said to Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.

58. And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay His head.

59. And He said to another, Follow Me! But he said, Lord, first allow me to go and bury my father.

60. Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.

61. And another also said, Lord, I will follow You, but first allow me to take leave of those in my house.

62. And Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.  

## Luke 10

1. And after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, And He sent them two and two before His face into every city and place where He was about to come.

2. Then He said to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth laborers into His harvest.

3. Go! Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

4. Carry neither purse nor bag nor sandals. And greet no one by the way.

5. And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.

6. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest on it. If not, it shall return to you,

7. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things shared by them; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not move from house to house.

8. And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.

9. And heal the sick that are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near you!

10. And into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, going out into the streets say,

11. Even the dust of your city which clings to us, we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near you.

12. But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.

13. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented a long while ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgment than for you.

15. And you, Capernaum, which has been lifted up to Heaven, you shall be thrust down into hell.

16. The one hearing you hears Me, and he who despises you despises Me; he who rejects you also rejects Him who sent Me.   

17. And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through Your name.

18. And He said to them, I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning.

19. Behold, I give to you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the authority of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you.

20. Yet do not rejoice in this, that the evil spirits are subject to you, rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.

21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the sophisticated and cunning, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing before You.

22. All things are delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son will reveal Him.

23. And He turned to His disciples and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.

24. For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen them, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard them.   

25. And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?

27. And answering, he said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.

28. And He said to him, You have answered right, do this and you shall live.

29. But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30. And answering, Jesus said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

31. And by coincidence a certain priest came down that way and seeing him, he passed by on the opposite side.

32. And in the same way a Levite, also being at the place, coming and seeing him, he passed on the opposite side.

33. But a certain traveling Samaritan came upon him, and seeing him, he was filled with pity.

34. And coming near, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. And going on the next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, when I come again I will repay you.

36. Then which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?

37. And he said, The one doing the deed of mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise.   

38. And as they went, it happened that He entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.

39. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard His word.

40. But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she came to Him and said, Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.

41. And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.

42. But one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.  

## Luke 11

1. And it happened as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught His disciples.

2. And He said to them, When you pray, say: Our Father, who is in Heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come, Your will be done, as in Heaven, so also on the earth.

3. Give us day by day our daily bread,

4. and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

5. And He said to them, which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,

6. for a friend of mine has come from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him?

7. And he answering from inside may say, Do not trouble me. The door is now shut and my children are in bed with me. I cannot rise and give to you.

8. I say to you, though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needs.

9. And I say to you, Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened to you.

10. For everyone who asks receives. And he who seeks finds. And to him who knocks it shall be opened.

11. For what father of you, if the son asks for bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake for a fish?

12. Or if he shall ask for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

13. If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?   

14. And He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it happened as the demon was going out, the dumb one spoke. And the people marveled.

15. But some of them said, He casts out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons.

16. And others, tempting Him, sought a sign from Heaven from him.

17. But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And a house divided against a house falls.

18. If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.

19. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.

20. But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, no doubt the kingdom of God has come on you.

21. When the strong man, fully armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace.

22. But when one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him. He takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and he distributes his arms.

23. He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.

24. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks through dry places seeking rest. And finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came out.

25. And when he comes, he finds it swept and decorated.

26. And he goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entering in, they dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first.   

27. And it happened as He spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You have sucked.

28. But He said, No; rather, blessed are they who hear the Word of God and keep it.   

29. But the crowds pressing on Him, He began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also shall the Son of man be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, One greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, One greater than Jonah is here.

33. No one, when he has lighted a lamp, puts it in a secret place, or under a grain-measure, but on a lampstand, so that they who come in may see the light.

34. The light of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is sound, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.

35. Therefore take heed that the light in you is not darkness.

36. Therefore if your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the shining of a lamp enlightens you.   

37. And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. And He went in and reclined.

38. And when the Pharisee saw it, he was amazed that He had not first washed before dinner.

39. And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the platter clean, but your inward part is full of plunder and wickedness.

40. Fools! Did not He who made the outside also make the inside?

41. But give alms of such things as you have, and behold, all things are clean to you.

42. But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over judgment and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to leave the other undone.

43. Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.

44. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like unseen tombs and the men walking above are not aware of them.

45. And one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, Master, you reproach us also when you say this.

46. And He said, Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens grievous to be carried, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Truly you bear witness that you consent to the deeds of your fathers. For they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.

49. Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute,

50. so that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

51. from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple. Truly I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.

52. Woe to you, lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you have hindered those who were entering in.

53. And as He said these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw Him out concerning many things,

54. lying in ambush for Him, and seeking to catch something out of His mouth, so that they might accuse Him.  

## Luke 12

1. In the meantime, when there had gathered together an innumerable crowd of people, so as to trample on one another, He began to say to His disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor anything hidden that shall not be known.

3. Therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light. And that which you have spoken in the ear in secret rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.

4. And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

5. But I will warn you of whom you shall fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you, fear Him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them is forgotten before God.

7. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore do not fear, you are of more value than many sparrows.

8. Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess Me before men, the Son of man also shall confess him before the angels of God.

9. But he who denies Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

10. And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.

11. And when they bring you into the synagogues, and to rulers and authorities, take no thought as to how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say.

12. For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.   

13. And one of the company said to Him, Master, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

14. And He said to him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?

15. And He said to them, Watch and keep yourselves from covetousness. For a man's life is not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.

16. And He spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.

17. And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room in which to store my fruits?

18. And he said, I will do this. I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and I will store all my fruits and my goods there.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat drink and be merry.

20. But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul shall be required of you, then whose shall be those things which you have prepared?

21. So is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.   

22. And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious as to your life, what you shall eat; nor for the body, what you shall put on.

23. Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.

24. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap, having neither storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them. How much more are you better than the birds?

25. And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?

26. If then you are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow; they do not toil, they do not spin. And yet I say to you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

28. If then God so clothes the grass (which today is in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven) how much more will He clothe you, O little-faiths?

29. And do not seek what you shall eat, nor what you shall drink, and stop being in anxiety.

30. For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you have need of these things.

31. But rather seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.

32. Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell what you have and give alms. Make for yourselves purses which do not become old, an unfailing treasure in Heaven, where no thief comes nor moth corrupts.

34. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

35. Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning.

36. And you yourselves be like men who wait for their lord, whenever he shall return from the wedding, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.

37. Blessed are those servants whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Truly I say to you that he shall gird himself and make them recline; and coming up he will serve them.

38. And if he comes in the second watch, or comes in the third watch, and find it so, blessed are those servants.

39. And know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.

40. Therefore be ready also, for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.   

41. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You speak this parable to us or also to all?

42. And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall set over his houseservants, to give them their portion of food in season?

43. Blessed is that servant when his lord comes and finds him so doing.

44. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.

45. But if that servant says in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to beat the male servants and women servants, and to eat and drink and to be drunk,

46. the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect, and at an hour when he does not know. And he will cut him apart, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

47. And that servant who knew his lord's will and did not prepare, nor did according to His will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

48. But he not knowing, and doing things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomever much is given, of him much shall be required. And to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.

49. I have come to send fire on the earth. And what will I do if it is already kindled?

50. But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed down until it is accomplished!

51. Do you suppose that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.

52. For from now on, there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.   

54. And He also said to the crowd, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, immediately you say, There is a shower coming. And so it is.

55. And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it occurs.

56. Hypocrites! You know to discern the face of the heaven and the earth, but how is it that you do not discern this time?

57. And why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?

58. For as you go with your adversary to the judge, give pains in the way to be set free from him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into the prison.

59. I tell you, you shall not depart from there until you have paid the very last lepton.  

## Luke 13

1. And some were present at the same time reporting to Him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

2. And answering, Jesus said to them, Do you suppose that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things?

3. I tell you, No. But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were sinners above all men who lived in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, No. But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.   

6. He also spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard. And he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.

7. And he said to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none. Cut it down, why does it encumber the ground?

8. And answering, he said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and throw manure.

9. And if it bears fruit, well; and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.   

10. And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

11. And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bowed together and was not able to be completely erect.

12. And when Jesus saw her, He called and said to her, Woman, you are delivered from your infirmity.

13. And He laid His hands on her. And instantly she was made erect, and she glorified God.

14. And answering, the synagogue ruler, being angry because Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, said to the crowd, There are six days in which it is right to work. Therefore in them come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

15. And the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the sabbath loosen his ox or ass from the stall and lead it away, to give it drink?

16. And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound, lo these eighteen years, be loosened from this bond on the Sabbath day?

17. And when He had said these things, all His adversaries were ashamed. And all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.   

18. And He said, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and threw into his garden. And it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in its branches.

20. And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.

22. And He went through the cities and villages, teaching and progressing toward Jerusalem.   

23. And one said to Him, Lord, are the ones being saved few? And He said to them,

24. Strive to enter in at the narrow gate. For I say to you, many will seek to enter in and shall not be able.

25. And once the Master of the house has risen up and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and He shall answer and say to you, I do not know you; from where are you;

26. then you shall begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You have taught in our streets.

27. But He shall say, I tell you, I do not know you; from where you are. Depart from Me, all workers of unrighteousness!

28. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrust out.

29. And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline in the kingdom of God.

30. And behold, there are last ones which will be first, and there are first ones which will be last.   

31. The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to Him, Go out and depart from here, for Herod will kill you.

32. And He said to them, You go and tell that fox, Behold, today and tomorrow, I cast out demons and I complete cures, and the third day I will be finished.

33. Yet I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following. For it cannot be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.

34. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! the one killing the prophets, and stoning those having been sent to her; how often I desired to gather your children in the way a hen gathers her brood under the wings, and you did not desire  it.

35. Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And truly I say to you, You will not see Me until it come when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.  

## Luke 14

1. And as He went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, it happened that they watched Him.

2. And behold, a certain man was dropsical before Him.

3. And answering, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

4. And they were silent. And taking him, He healed him and let him go.

5. And He answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?

6. And they could not answer Him again as to these things.   

7. And He put forth a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose out the chief places, saying to them,

8. When you are invited by anyone to a wedding, do not recline in the chief seat, lest a more honorable man than you may be invited by him.

9. And he who invited you and him shall come and say to you, Give place to this man; and then you begin with shame to take the last place.

10. But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then glory shall be to you before those reclining with you.

11. For whoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.

12. And He also said to him who invited Him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends or your brothers, or your kinsmen, or your rich neighbors; lest they also invite you again, and a recompense be made to you.

13. But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,

14. and you shall be blessed, for they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.   

15. And one of those who reclined with Him heard these things, and he said to Him, Blessed are those eating bread in the kingdom of God.

16. And He said to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many.

17. And he sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.

18. And all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, I must go and see it. I beg you, have me excused.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I beg you, have me excused.

20. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

21. And coming up that servant reported these things to his lord. And the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the maimed, and the lame and the blind.

22. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and still there is room.

23. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you that none of these men who were invited shall taste of my supper.   

25. And great crowds went with Him. And He turned and said to them,

26. If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.

27. And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me, he cannot be My disciple.

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he may have enough to finish it;

29. lest perhaps, after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish, all those seeing begin to mock him,

30. saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.

31. Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not first sit down and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?

32. Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.

33. So then, everyone of you who does not forsake all his possessions, he cannot be My disciple.

34. Salt is good, but if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?

35. It is not fit for the land, nor for manure, but men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.  

## Luke 15

1. And all the tax-collectors and sinners drew near to Him in order to hear Him.

2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.

3. And He spoke this parable to them, saying,

4. What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?

5. And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7. I say to you that likewise joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.

8. Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does she not light a lamp and sweep the house, and seek carefully until she finds it?

9. And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.

10. Likewise I say to you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.   

11. And He said, A certain man had two sons.

12. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that is coming to me. And he divided his living to them.

13. And not many days afterward, the younger son gathered all together and went away into a far country. And there he wasted his property, living dissolutely.

14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land. And he began to be in want.

15. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.

16. And he was longing to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, and no one gave to him.

17. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father abound in loaves, and I perish with hunger!

18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you

19. and am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.

20. And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.

21. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you, and am no more worthy to be called your son.

22. But the father said to his servants, Bring the best robe and put it on him. And put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.

23. And bring the fattened calf here and kill it. And let us eat and be merry,

24. for this my son was dead and is alive again, he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.

25. And his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.

27. And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him safe and sound.

28. And he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and entreated him.

29. And answering he said to his father, Lo, these many years I have served you, neither did I transgress your commandment at any time. And yet you never gave me a kid so that I might make merry with my friends.

30. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fattened calf.

31. And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.

32. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.  

## Luke 16

1. And He also said to His disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward. And he was accused to him, that he had wasted his goods.

2. And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be steward.

3. And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my lord is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what I will do, so that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses.

5. So he called every one of his lord's debtors and said; to the first, How much do you owe my lord?

6. And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.

7. And he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred cors of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.

8. And the unjust steward's lord commended him because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.

9. And I say to you, Make friends by the mammon of unrighteousness for yourselves, so that when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.

10. He who is faithful in the least is also faithful in much. And he who is unjust in the least is also unjust in much.

11. Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust the true riches to you?

12. And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who shall give you that which is your own?

13. No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

14. And being money-lovers, all the Pharisees also heard all these things. And they derided Him.

15. And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone is pressing into it.

17. And it is easier for the heaven and earth to pass than for one tittle of the law to fail.

18. Everyone putting away his wife and marrying another commits adultery; and everyone marrying her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.   

19. There was a certain rich man who was customarily clothed in purple and fine linen and making merry in luxury every day.

20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores

21. and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. But even the dogs came and licked his sores.

22. And it happened that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich one also died and was buried.

23. And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted and you are tormented.

26. And besides all this, there is a great chasm fixed between you and us; so that they desiring to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they pass over to us from there.

27. And he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house,

28. for I have five brothers, so that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.

30. And he said, No, father Abraham, but if one should go to them from the dead, they would repent.

31. And he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even though one rose from the dead.  

## Luke 17

1. And He said to the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come. But woe to him through whom they come!

2. It were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

3. Take heed to yourselves. If your brother trespasses against you, rebuke him. And if he repents, forgive him.

4. And if he trespasses against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns again to you, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.

6. And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up and be planted in the sea! And it would obey you.

7. But which of you who has a servant plowing or feeding will say to him immediately after he has come from the field, Come, recline?

8. Will he not say to him, Prepare something so that I may eat, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink. And afterward you shall eat and drink.

9.  Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.

10. So likewise you, when you shall have done all the things commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, for we have done what we ought to do.   

11. And as He went to Jerusalem, it happened that he went through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as He entered into a certain village, ten leprous men met Him, who stood afar off.

13. And they lifted voice and said, Jesus, Master, pity us!

14. And seeing them, He said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it happened, as they went, that they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and glorified God with a loud voice.

16. And he fell down on his face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.

17. And answering, Jesus said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?

18. Were none found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?

19. And He said to him, Rise and go, your faith has cured you.   

20. And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation.

21. Nor shall they say, Lo here! or, behold, there! For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.

22. And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.

23. And they shall say to you, Lo, here! or, behold, there! Do not go away, nor follow.

24. For as the lightning which lights up, flashing from the one part under heaven, and shines to the other part under heaven, so also shall the Son of man be in His day.

25. But first He must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so it also shall be in the days of the Son of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. So also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

29. but the day Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from the heaven and destroyed them all.

30. Even so it shall be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day he who shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise, he who is in the field, let him not return to the things behind.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

34. I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

35. Two shall be grinding together, one will be taken, and the other left.

36. Two shall be in the field, one will be taken, and the other left.

37. And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.  

## Luke 18

1. And He also spoke a parable to them to teach it is always right to pray, and not to faint,

2. saying, A certain judge was in a certain city, not fearing God, nor respecting man.

3. And a widow was in that city. And she came to Him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.

4. And he would not do so for a time. But afterward he said within himself, Though I do not fear God nor regard man,

5. yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, that she not wear me down in the end.

6. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.

7. And shall not God avenge His own elect who cry day and night to Him, though He has been long-suffering over them?

8. I say to you that He will avenge them speedily. Yet when the Son of man comes, shall He find faith on the earth?   

9. And He spoke this parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others:

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-collector.

11. The Pharisee stood and prayed within himself in this way: God, I thank You that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax-collector.

12. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

13. And standing afar off, the tax-collector would not even lift up his eyes to Heaven, but struck on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!

14. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.   

15. And they also brought infants to Him, that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw, they, rebuked them.

16. But Jesus called them and said, Allow the little children to come to Me, and forbid them not. For of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no way enter into it.   

18. And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? None is good except One, God.

20. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.

21. And he said, I have kept all these from my youth up.

22. And when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, Yet you lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, follow Me.

23. And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich.

24. And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, He said, How hardly those having riches shall enter into the kingdom of God!

25. For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And the ones who heard said, And who can be saved?

27. And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.

28. And Peter said, Lo, we have left all and have followed You.

29. And He said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the world to come everlasting life.   

31. And He took the Twelve and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be accomplished.

32. For He will be delivered to the nations and will be mocked and insulted and spat on.

33. And they will scourge Him and put Him to death, and the third day He will rise again.

34. And they did not understand any of these things. And this saying was hidden from them, nor did they know the things which were spoken.   

35. And as He came near Jericho, it happened that a certain blind man sat by the roadside begging.

36. And hearing the crowd pass by, he asked what it meant.

37. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by.

38. And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David! Have mercy on me.

39. And they who were in front rebuked him that he should be quiet. But he cried so much the more, Son of David! Have mercy on me.

40. And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,

41. saying, What do you desire that I should do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

42. And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight! Your faith has saved you.

43. And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And when they saw, all the people gave praise to God.  

## Luke 19

1. And going in, He passed through Jericho.

2. And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was a chief tax-collector. And he was rich.

3. And he sought to see Jesus, to see who He was. And he could not because of the press, because he was little in stature.

4. And he ran in front and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him. For He was to pass through that way.

5. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him. And He said to him, Zaccheus! Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.

6. And hurrying he came down, and received Him joyfully.

7. And seeing, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to stay with a sinful man.

8. And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor. And in anything I accused anyone falsely, I restore it fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.   

11. And as they heard these things, He added and spoke a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.

12. Therefore He said, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself, and to return.

13. And He called his ten servants and delivered ten minas, and said to them, Trade until I come back.

14. But his citizens hated him. And they sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this one to reign over us.

15. And when he had received his kingdom and had returned, then it happened that he commanded these servants to be called to him; the ones to whom he had given the silver; so that he might know what each had gained by trading.

16. And came the first, saying, Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.

17. And he said to him, Well done, good servant, because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has made five minas.

19. And he said the same to him, You be over five cities.

20. And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I have kept in a handkerchief.

21. For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.

22. And he said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, wicked servant! You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I had not laid down and reaping what I did not sow.

23. And why did you not give my silver on the bank table, and coming I might have exacted it with interest?

24. And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him and give it to him who has ten minas.

25. And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.

26. For I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given. And from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken from him.

27. But those who are my enemies, who did not desire that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.   

28. And saying these things, He went in front, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it happened as He drew near Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mount called Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples,

30. saying, Go into the village across from you, and having entered, you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has yet sat. Untie it and bring it.

31. And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? You will say this to him, Because the Lord has need of it.

32. And going, those who were sent found as He had said to them.

33. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?

34. And they said, The Lord has need of him.

35. And they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their garments on the colt. And they set Jesus on it.

36. And as He went, they spread their clothes in the way.

37. And when He had come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,

38. saying, Blessed is the King coming in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in the highest!

39. And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.

40. And He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.   

41. And as He drew near, He beheld the city and wept over it,

42. saying, If you had known, even you, even at least in this day of yours, the things for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.

43. For the days will come on you that your enemies will raise up a rampart to you, and will surround you, and will keep you in on every side.

44. And they will tear you down, and your children within you, and will not leave a stone on a stone because you did not know the time of your visitation.

45. And entering into the temple, He began to cast out those selling and buying in it,

46. saying to them, It is written, "My house is a house of prayer," but you have made it a den of thieves.

47. And He taught in the temple daily. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him.

48. And they could not find what they might do, for all the people were hanging on Him, listening.  

## Luke 20

1. And on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and proclaimed the gospel, it happened that the chief priests and the scribes along with the elders came on Him.

2. And they spoke to Him, saying, Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?

3. And He answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing, and you answer me:

4. The baptism of John, was it from Heaven or from men?

5. And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?

6. But if we say, From men, then all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

7. And they answered that they could not tell from where it was.

8. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.   

9. And He began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to vinedressers. And he went into a far country for a long time.

10. And in season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that they should give him the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty.

11. And again he sent another servant. And they also beat him and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

12. And again he sent a third. And they also wounded him and cast him out.

13. And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect him when they see him.

14. But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.

15. So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?

16. He shall come and destroy these vinedressers and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, Let it not be!

17. And He looked at them and said, What then is this which is written, " The Stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the Head of the corner?

18. Whoever shall fall on that Stone shall be broken, but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."

19. And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him the same hour. And they feared the people, for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.   

20. And they watched and sent forth spies, pretending themselves to be righteous men, so that they might seize upon a word of His, that they might deliver Him in this way to the power and authority of the governor.

21. And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not accept the person of anyone, but truly teach the way of God.

22. Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?

23. But He perceived their craftiness and said to them, Why do you tempt Me?

24. Show Me a coin. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar's.

25. And He said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.

26. And they could not take hold of His words before the people. And they marveled at His answer and were silent.   

27. And certain of the Sadducees came, those speaking against a resurrection, that it was not to be. And they asked Him,

28. saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If anyone's brother dies, having a wife, and if he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.

29. Therefore there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died without children.

30. And the second took her as a wife, and he died childless.

31. And the third took her. And likewise the seven left no children and died.

32. Last of all the woman also died.

33. Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her as a wife.

34. And answering, Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,

35. but they who shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.

36. Nor can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.

37. But that the dead are raised, even Moses pointed out at the Bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. For He is not God of the dead, but of the living. For all live to Him.   

39. And answering, certain of the scribes said, Teacher, you have spoken well.

40. And after that they did not dare ask Him anything.

41. And He said to them, How do they say that Christ is the Son of David?

42. Even David himself says in the Book of Psalms, "The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

43. until I place Your enemies as Your footstool."

44. David then calls Him Lord; how then is He his son?

45. And as all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at the feasts;

47. who devour widows' houses, and make long prayers for a show; the same shall receive a more severe condemnation.  

## Luke 21

1. And looking up, He saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And He also saw a certain poor widow casting two lepta in there.

3. And He said, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them.

4. For all these have cast in to the offerings of God from their abundance, but out of her poverty she has cast in all the living she had.   

5. And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, He said,

6.  As to these things which you see, days will come in which there shall not be left a stone on a stone, which shall not be thrown down.

7. And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, but when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when these things are about to take place?

8. And He said, Take heed that you are not deceived, for many shall come in My name, saying, I AM! Also, The time has come! Do not go after them.

9. But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for all these things must first occur, but the end is not at once.

10. And He said to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. And great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines and plagues. And there shall be terrors and great signs from Heaven.

12. But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.

13. And it shall return to you for a testimony.

14. Therefore settle it in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer.

15. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

16. And you shall be betrayed also by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends. And they will cause some of you to be put to death.

17. And you shall be hated by all for My name's sake.

18. But there shall not a hair of your head perish.

19. By your patience you will gain your souls.   

20. And when you see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that its destruction has come.

21. And let those in Judea flee to the mountains. And those in its midst, let them go out. And those in the open spaces, let them not go into her.

22. For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

23. But woe to those who are with child, and to those suckling in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath on this people.

24. And they shall fall by the sword's edge. And shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the nations until the times of the nations is fulfilled.

25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars. And on the earth will be anxiety of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

26. men fainting from fear, and expecting those things which have come on the earth. For the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.

27. And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. And when these things begin to happen, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.   

29. And He spoke a parable to them: Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.

30. Now when they sprout leaves, seeing it you will know that summer is now near.

31. So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.

32. Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away until all these things are fulfilled.

33. The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.

34. And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts are weighed down with headaches and drinking and anxieties of this life; and that day should suddenly come on you;

35. for it shall come as a snare on all those sitting on the face of the whole earth.

36. Watch therefore, praying in every season that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things which shall occur, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. And in the days He was teaching in the temple. And in the nights He went out, and lodged in the mount called the Mount of Olives.

38. And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple, in order to hear Him.  

## Luke 22

1. And the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.

2. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.

3. And Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the Twelve.

4. And going, he talked with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them.

5. And they were glad and they agreed to give him silver.

6. And he fully consented, and he sought opportunity to betray Him to them, away from the crowd.   

7. And the day of the Unleavened Bread came, when the passover must be killed.

8. And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat.

9. And they said to Him. Where do You desire that we prepare?

10. And He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city, you will meet a man bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house where he enters.

11. And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I shall eat the passover with My disciples?

12. And he shall show you a large, furnished upper room. Prepare there.

13. And they went and found it as He had said to them. And they prepared the passover.

14. And when the hour came, He and the twelve apostles with Him reclined.

15. And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.

16. For I say to you, I will not any more eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And He took the cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.

18. For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come.

19. And He took bread and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of Me.

20. In the same way also the cup, after having dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.   

21. But, behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.

22. And truly the Son of man goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!

23. And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing.

24. And there was also a dispute among them as to which of them seems to be greater.

25. And He said to them, The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them. And they who exercise authority on them are called benefactors.

26. But you shall not be so: but the greater among you, let him be as the lesser, and he who governs, as one who serves.

27. For which is the greater; he who reclines, or he who serves? Is it not he who reclines? But I am among you as He who serves.

28. You are those who have continued with Me in My trials.

29. And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father has appointed to Me,

30. that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired you, that he may sift you as wheat.

32. But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not. And when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.

33. And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both into prison and into death.

34. And He said, I say to you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before you shall deny knowing Me three times.

35. And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and wallet and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.

36. And He said to them, But now, he who has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his wallet. And he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.

37. For I say to you that this which is written must yet be accomplished in Me, "And he was reckoned among the transgressors"; for the things concerning Me have an end.

38. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.   

39. And going out, according to His custom, He went to the Mount of Olives. And His disciples also followed Him.

40. And when He was at the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.

41. And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw. And He kneeled down and prayed,

42. saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.

43. And an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.

44. And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

45. And when He rose up from prayer and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping because of sorrow.

46. And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray lest you enter into temptation.   

47. And as He was yet speaking, behold a crowd! And he who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, went before them. And he drew near Jesus to kiss Him.

48. But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?

49. And those around Him seeing what was about to occur, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

51. And Jesus answered and said, Let it go until now. And touching his ear, He healed him.

52. And Jesus said to the chief priests and commanders of the temple, and the elders, who had come to Him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves?

53. When I was with you in the temple daily, you did not stretch out your hand on Me. But this is your hour, and the authority of the darkness.   

54. And laying hold on Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

55. And lighting a fire in the middle of the court, and they sitting down, Peter sat in their midst.

56. But a certain slave-girl saw him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked on him and said, This man was with him also.

57. And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.

58. And after a little while another saw him and said, You also are of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not!

59. And about an hour afterward, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this one was also with him, for he is a Galilean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I do not know what you say. And immediately, while he still spoke, the cock crowed.

61. And the Lord turned and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me three times.

62. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.   

63. And the men who held Jesus mocked Him, beating Him.

64. And blindfolding Him, they struck Him on His face. And they asked Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is it who struck you?

65. And they spoke many other things blasphemously against Him.

66. And when day came, the body of elders of the people, and the chief priests and the scribes, came together. And they led Him to the sanhedrin, saying,

67. Are you the Christ? Tell us. And He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe.

68. Also if I ask you, you will not answer Me nor let Me go.

69. From now on the Son of man shall sit at the right hand of the power of God.

70. And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say it, because I AM!

71. And they said, What need do we have for any witness? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.  

## Luke 23

1. And rising up, all the multitude of them led Him before Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse Him, saying, We have found this one perverting the nation and forbidding them to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be a king, Christ.

3. And Pilate asked Him, saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And He answered him and said, You say it.

4. And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.

5. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.

6. And hearing Galilee, Pilate asked if the man is a Galilean.

7. And knowing that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.

8. And seeing Jesus, Herod greatly rejoiced, for he had desired to see Him for a long time, because he had heard many things about Him. And he hoped to see some miracle done by Him.

9. And he questioned Him in many words, but He answered him nothing.

10. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.

11. And humiliating Him with his guardsmen, and mocking Him by putting luxurious clothing around Him, Herod sent Him again to Pilate.

12. And that same day Pilate and Herod became friends with one another, for before they were at enmity between themselves.   

13. And when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. Pilate said to them, You have brought this Man to me as perverting the people. And behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no fault in this Man regarding those things of which you accuse Him;

15. no, nor even Herod, for I sent you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.

16. Therefore I will chastise Him and release Him.

17. (For it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast.)

18. And they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this One! And release to us Barabbas

19. (who was thrown into prison because of a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder).

20. And Pilate, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.

21. But they cried, saying, Crucify! Crucify Him!

22. And he said to them the third time, Why? What evil has He done? I have found no cause of death in Him, therefore I will chastise Him and let Him go.

23. But they pressed on him, with loud voices, requesting that He might be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.

24. And Pilate gave judgment that their request should be granted.

25. And he released to them the one who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, for whom they had asked. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.   

26. And as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country. And they laid the cross on him, that he might carry it after Jesus.

27. And a great multitude of people were following Him, and of women who also were bewailing and lamenting Him.

28. But turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which did not suckle.

30. And they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! And to the hills, Cover us!

31. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?   

32. And two others, two criminals, were led with Him to be put to death.

33. And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified Him and the criminals there, one on the right, and one on the left.

34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do. And parting His clothing, they cast lots.

35. And the people stood watching. And also the rulers with them, scoffing, saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.

36. And coming near, the soldiers also mocked Him, and offering Him sour wine,

37. and saying, If You are the king of the Jews, save Yourself.

38. And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the hanged criminals blasphemed Him, saying, If you are Christ, save Yourself and us.

40. But answering, the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are in the same condemnation.

41. And we indeed justly so, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this Man has done nothing amiss.

42. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.   

44. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.

46. And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And when He had said this, He breathed out the spirit.

47. And when the centurion saw what had been done, he glorified God, saying, Truly this Man was righteous.

48. And all the crowd arriving together at this sight, beholding the things happening, struck their breasts and returned.

49. And all those known to Him stood at a distance; and the women, those accompanying Him from Galilee, were seeing these things.   

50. And behold, a man named Joseph, a councillor, a good man and a just one,

51. this one was not assenting to their counsel and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews; and he also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

52. This man went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.

53. And he took it down and wrapped it in linen. And he laid it in a tomb that had been cut in the stone, in which no man had before been laid.

54. And that day was the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

55. And also women were following, who were accompanying Him out of Galilee, who watched the tomb, and how His body was placed.

56. And they returned and they prepared spices and ointment. And they rested on the sabbath day according to the commandment.  

## Luke 24

1. And on the first of the sabbaths, while still very early, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.

2. But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

3. And going in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And as they were much perplexed about it, it happened that, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.

5. And as they were afraid, and bowed their faces down to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but has risen. Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,

7. saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?

8. And they remembered His words

9. and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the Eleven and to the rest.

10. It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed to them like foolishness, and they did not believe them.

12. And Peter arose and ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linens lying alone. And he went away wondering to himself at what had happened.   

13. And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, it being about sixty stadia from Jerusalem.

14. And they talked to each other of all these things which had happened.

15. And while they talked and reasoned, it happened that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.

16. But their eyes were held so that they could not know Him.

17. And He said to them, What words are these that you have with one another as you walk, and are so sad.

18. And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which have occurred there in these days?

19. And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a man, prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,

20. and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the judgement of death, and have crucified Him.

21. But we had trusted that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.

22. Yes, and also some of our women astounded us, having been early at the tomb;

23. and when they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive.

24. And some of those with us went to the tomb and found it even as the women had said. But they did not see Him.

25. And He said to them, O fools and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets spoke!

26. Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?

27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.

28. And they drew near the village where they were going. And He appeared to be going further.

29. But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.

30. And it happened as He reclined with them, taking the loaf, He blessed it, and breaking it, He gave to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him. And He became invisible to them.

32. And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the way and while He opened the Scriptures to us?

33. And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found assembled the Eleven and those with them.

34. And they said, the Lord has indeed risen, and has appeared to Simon.

35. And they told what things had happened in the way, and how He had been known by them in breaking of the loaf.   

36. And as they spoke this, Jesus Himself stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace to you!

37. But they were terrified and filled with fear, for they thought they saw a spirit.

38. And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

39. Behold My hands and My feet, that I am He! Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have.

40. And when He had spoken this, He showed them His hands and feet.

41. And while they still did not believe for joy, and wondered, He said to them, Have you any food here?

42. And they handed to Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.

43. And He took it and ate before them.

44. And He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms about Me.

45. And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.

46. And He said to them, So it is written, and so it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,

47. and that repentance and remission of sins should be proclaimed in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. And you are witnesses of these things.

49. And behold, I send the promise of My father on you. But you sit in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.   

50. And He led them out as far as Bethany. And lifting up His hands, He blessed them.

51. And it happened as He blessed them, He withdrew from them and was carried up into Heaven.

52. And worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

53. And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
