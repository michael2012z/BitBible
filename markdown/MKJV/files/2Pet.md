# 2 Peter

## 2 Peter 1

1. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ,

2. Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,

3. according as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who has called us to glory and virtue,

4. through which He has given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, so that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.   

5. But also in this very thing, bringing in all diligence, filling out your faith with virtue, and with virtue, knowledge;

6. and knowledge with self-control, and with self-control, patience, and with patience. godliness,

7. and with godliness, brotherly kindness, and with brotherly kindness, love.

8. For if these things are in you and abound, you shall not be idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. But he in whom these things are not present is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his sins in times past.

10. Therefore, brothers, rather be diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you do these things, you shall never fall.

11. For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.   

12. Therefore I will not neglect to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them and are established in the present truth.

13. But I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder,

14. knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.

15. And I will also be diligent to cause you to always have memory of these things after my departure.   

16. For not following cunningly devised fables, but becoming eyewitnesses of the majesty of Jesus Christ, we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord.

17. For He received honor and glory from God the Father, when was borne to Him a voice from the excellent glory, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

18. And we heard this voice being borne from Heaven, being with Him in the holy mountain.   

19. We also have a more sure word of prophecy, to which you do well to take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the Daystar arises in your hearts,

20. knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture came into being of its own private interpretation.

21. For prophecy was not borne at any time by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke being borne along by the Holy Spirit.  

## 2 Peter 2

1. But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who secretly will bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.

2. And many will follow their pernicious ways, and because of them the way of truth will be evil spoken of.   

3. And through covetousness they will use you for gain with well-turned words; for whom judgment from of old does not linger, and their destruction does not sleep.

4. For God did not spare the angels who sinned, but thrust them down into Tartarus, and delivered them into chains of darkness, being reserved to judgment.

5. And He did not spare the old world, but saved Noah the eighth one, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.

6. And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, He condemned them with an overthrow, setting an example to men intending to live ungodly.   

7. And He delivered righteous Lot, oppressed with the lustful behavior of the lawless.

8. For that righteous one living among them, in seeing and hearing, his righteous soul was tormented from day to day with their unlawful deeds.

9.  The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust for a day of judgment, to be punished,   

10. and especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise dominion. They are darers, self-pleasing; not trembling at glories, speaking evil.

11. Where angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reproaching accusation against them before the Lord.

12. But these, as unreasoning natural brute animals, having been born for capture and corruption, speak evil of the things that they do not understand. And they will utterly perish in their own corruption,

13. being about to receive the wages of unrighteousness, deeming indulgence as pleasure in the daytime, and reveling in spots and blemishes, feasting along with you in their deceits,

14. having eyes full of adultery and never ceasing from sin, alluring unstable souls, having a heart exercised with covetousness. They are cursed children

15. who have forsaken the right way and have gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,

16. but had reproof of his lawbreaking, a dumb ass speaking in a man's voice, held back the madness of the prophet.

17. These are wells without water, clouds driven with a tempest, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.

18. For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they lure through the lusts of the flesh, by unbridled lust, the ones who were escaping from those who live in error;

19. promising them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom anyone has been overcome, even to this one he has been enslaved.

20. For if they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus, and are again entangled, they have been overcome by these, their last things are worse than the first.

21. For it would have been better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than fully knowing it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.

22. But the word of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog turning to his own vomit; and, The washed sow to wallowing in the mire.  

## 2 Peter 3

1. Beloved, I now write this second letter to you, in which I stir up your pure mind to remember

2. the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of the Lord and Savior by us, the apostles.   

3. First, knowing this, that there will come in the last days scoffers walking according to their own lusts

4. and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.

5. For this is hidden from them by their willing it, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of the water, and through water, being held together by the word of God,

6. through which the world that then was, being flooded by water, perished.

7. But the present heavens and the earth being kept in store by the same word, are being kept for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.   

8. But, beloved, let not this one thing be hidden from you, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.   

9. The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, not willing that any of us should perish, but that all of us should come to repentance.

10. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat. And the earth and the works in it will be burned up.   

11. Then, all these things being about to be dissolved, what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,

12. looking for and rushing the coming of the Day of God, on account of which the heavens, being on fire, will melt away, and the elements will melt, burning with heat?

13. But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

14. Therefore, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent, spotless, and without blemish, to be found by Him in peace.

15. And think of the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation (as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him

16. as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction).

17. Therefore, beloved, knowing beforehand, beware lest being led away with the error of the lawless, you fall from your own steadfastness.

18. But grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
