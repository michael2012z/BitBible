# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.   

2. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken, I have nursed and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against Me.

3. The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel does not know; My people do not understand.

4. Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who make others rotten! They have forsaken the LORD; they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger; they have gone away backward.

5. Why should you be stricken any more? You will revolt more and more; the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

6. From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; only a wound and a stripe and a fresh blow; they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor soothed with oil.

7. Your land is wasted, your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land right before your eyes, and it is wasted, as overthrown by strangers.

8. And the daughter of Zion is left a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a garden of cucumbers, like a besieged city.

9. Except the LORD of hosts had left us a very small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be like Gomorrah.   

10. Hear the word of the LORD, rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.

11. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? says the LORD; I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of he-goats.

12. When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?

13. Bring no more vain sacrifice; incense is an abomination to Me; the new moon and sabbath, the going to meeting; I cannot endure evil and the assembly!

14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; they are a trouble to Me; I am weary to bear them.

15. And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.   

16. Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to do evil;

17. learn to do good; seek judgment, reprove the oppressor. Judge the orphan, plead for the widow.

18. Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD; though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.

19. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;

20. but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.   

21. How has the faithful city become a harlot? It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.

22. Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water;

23. your rulers are rebellious, and companions of thieves; everyone loves a bribe, and is pursuing rewards; they do not judge the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.

24. And the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, says, Alas! I will ease Myself of My foes, and avenge Myself of My enemies.

25. And I will turn back My hand on you, and purge away your dross as with lye, and take away all your alloy.

26. And I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as at the beginning; afterwards you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.

27. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her returning ones with righteousness.

28. And the downfall of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together; and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.

29. For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be ashamed for the gardens which you have chosen.

30. For you shall be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.

31. And the strong shall be like tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall put them out.  

## Isaiah 2

1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

2. And it shall be, in the last days the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow into it.

3. And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us go to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion shall go out the Law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

4. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

5. O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.   

6. For You have forsaken Your people the house of Jacob, because they have become full from the east, and are fortune-tellers like the Philistines. And they clap their hands with the children of strangers.

7. And their land is full of silver and gold. There is no end of their treasures and their land is full of horses; nor an end of their chariots.

8. And their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.

9. And the man bowed down, and man was humbled, but You do not lift them up.   

10. Enter into the rock and hide in the dust for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of His majesty.

11. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

12. For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every proud and lofty one, and on every lifted up one; and he shall be brought low,

13. And it shall be on all the high and lifted up cedars of Lebanon, and on all the oaks of Bashan,

14. and on all the high mountains, and on all the lifted up hills;

15. and on every high tower, and on every fortified wall;

16. and on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasurable craft.

17. And the pride of man shall be bowed down, and the loftiness of men shall be made low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

18. And the idols shall completely vanish.

19. And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth for fear of the LORD and for the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake the earth terribly.

20. In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats;

21. to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD and for the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake the earth terribly.

22. Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostril; for in what is he to be esteemed?  

## Isaiah 3

1. For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water,

2. the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

3. the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the adviser, and the skilled worker, and the expert charmer.

4. And I will give young boys to be their rulers, and caprices shall rule over them.

5. And the people shall be crushed, every man by another, and every man by his neighbor; the boy shall act proudly against the old man, and the low against the honorable.

6. When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, You have clothing, you be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand;

7. in that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be a healer; there is no bread nor a cloak in my house. You shall not make me a ruler of the people.

8. For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of His glory.   

9. The look of their faces witnesses against them; and they declare their sin like Sodom. They do not hide it! Woe to their soul! For they have rewarded evil to themselves.

10. Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

11. Woe to the wicked! For the evil doing of his hand will be done to him.

12.  As for my people, children are their taskmasters, and women rule over them. Oh my people, your rulers cause you to go astray and destroy the way of your paths.

13. The LORD stands up to plead His case, and stands up to judge the people.

14. The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their kings; for you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

15. What do you mean? You crush My people and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.   

16. And the LORD says, Because the daughters of Zion are proud, and have walked with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;

17. therefore the LORD will strike with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their secret parts naked.

18. In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of ankle-bracelets, and the headbands, and the crescents,

19. the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;

20. the headdresses, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the houses of the soul, and the amulets;

21. the rings and nose jewels;

22. the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;

23. the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.

24. And it shall be, instead of sweet smell, there shall be an odor of decay; and instead of a sash, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a wrapping of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.

25. Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.

26. And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit deserted on the ground.  

## Isaiah 4

1. And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, we will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name, to take away our shame.   

2. In that day shall the Branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth excellent and comely for those who have escaped from Israel.

3. And it shall be, he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem;

4. when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.

5. And the LORD will create over all the site of Mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for on all the glory shall be a defense.

6. And there shall be a booth for a shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a hiding place from storm and rain.  

## Isaiah 5

1. Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.

2. And He fenced it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with choice vines, and built a tower in its midst, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and He looked for it to produce grapes. And it produced wild grapes.

3. And now, O people of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.

4. What more could have been done to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Who knows? I looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded rotten grapes.

5. And now I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard; I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; and break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down;

6. and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor dug; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.

7. For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant plant; and He looked for justice, but behold bloody iniquity; for righteousness, but behold a cry!   

8. Woe to those who join house to house, laying field to field, until the end of space, and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!

9. The LORD of hosts swore in my ears, Truly many houses shall be deserted, big and fair, without inhabitant.

10. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.

11. Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to go after strong drink; tarrying in the twilight while wine inflames them!

12. And the lyre, and the harp, the timbrel, and pipe, and wine, are at their feasts; but they do not regard the work of the LORD. Yea, they do not see the work of His hands.

13. For this My people go into exile without knowledge, and their honorable men into famine, and his multitude is dried up with thirst.

14. So hell has enlarged itself, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pride, and he who rejoices in her, shall go down into it.

15. And man is bowed down, and man is humbled and the eyes of the lofty are humbled.

16. But the LORD of hosts is exalted in judgment, and God the holy One is sanctified in righteousness.

17. Then shall the lambs feed in their way, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.   

18. Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin with cart ropes;

19. who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work, so that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know!

20. Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

21. Woe to those wise in their own eyes, and bright in their own sight!

22. Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and brave men to mix strong drink;

23. who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!

24. So, as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame burns up the chaff; their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

25. Therefore the anger of the LORD is kindled on His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has stricken them; and the hills trembled, and their dead bodies were as filth in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

26. And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will hiss to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.

27. None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the waistcoat of their loins be loosened, nor the thong of their sandals be broken;

28. whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.

29. Their roaring shall be like a lion; they shall roar like young lions; for, they shall roar and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

30. And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and one looks to the land, behold darkness, and lo, darkness! Distress! And the light shall be darkened by its clouds.  

## Isaiah 6

1. In the year that king Uzziah died I then saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.

2. Above it stood the seraphs; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

3. And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth full of His glory.

4. And the doorposts moved at the voice of the one who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.   

5. Then I said, Woe is me! For I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah.

6. Then one of the seraphs flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, snatched with tongs from the altar.

7. And he laid it on my mouth and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.

8. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me!   

9. And He said, Go, and tell this people, You hear indeed, but do not understand; and seeing you see, but do not know.

10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.

11. Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities are wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land laid waste, a desolation,

12. and until the LORD has moved men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.

13. But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak being felled, yet has its stump; the holy seed is its stump.  

## Isaiah 7

1. And it happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not overcome it.

2. And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved by the wind.

3. Then the LORD said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller's Field.

4. And say to him, Be careful and be quiet. Do not fear, nor be timid of heart because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah;

5. because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying,

6. Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and break her for ourselves, and set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tabeal.

7. So says the Lord God, It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it shall not be a people.

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.   

10. And the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,

11. Ask a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt the LORD.

13. And He said, Hear now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?

14. So, the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.

15. Butter and honey he shall eat until he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.

16. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you loathe shall be forsaken before both its kings.   

17. The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, since the days that Ephraim departed from Judah, the king of Assyria.

18. And it shall be, in that day the LORD shall hiss for the fly at the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

19. And they shall come and all of them shall rest in the desert valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorns, and on all the pastures.

20. In the same day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by those Beyond the River, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet; and it shall also sweep away the beard.

21. And it shall be, in that day a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep;

22. and it will be, from the plentiful supply of milk they shall give, he shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat who is left in the land.

23. And it shall be, in that day every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

24. With arrows and with the bow men shall come there, because all the land shall become briers and thorns.

25. And all hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of the ox, and for the trampling of sheep.  

## Isaiah 8

1. And the LORD said to me, Take a great scroll and write in it with a man's pen: Make Haste to Plunder! Hasten to the Prey!

2. And I took to myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

3. And I went to the prophetess. And she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz Make Haste to Plunder.

4. For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

5. The LORD also spoke to me again saying,

6. Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

7. And therefore, behold, the Lord brings on them the waters of the River, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory. And he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.

8. And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over; he shall reach to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.   

9. Suffer evil, O people, and be broken! And give ear, all from the far places of the earth. Gird yourselves and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!

10. Counsel a counsel, and it is frustrated. Speak a word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.

11. For so the LORD spoke to me with a strong hand, and warned me against walking in the way of this people, saying,

12. Do not say, A conspiracy! to everything of which this people says, A conspiracy! And do not fear their fear, nor be afraid.

13. Sanctify the LORD of hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.

14. And He shall be a sanctuary for you, but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of falling to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the people of Jerusalem.

15. And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.   

16. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.

17. And I will wait on the LORD, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for Him.

18. Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.

19. And when they shall say to you, Seek to the mediums and to wizards who peep and mutter; should not a people seek to their God, than for the living to the dead?

20. To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because no light is in them.

21. And they shall pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall be, they shall be hungry; They shall rave and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

22. And they shall look to the land; and behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish! And they are driven away into darkness.  

## Isaiah 9

1. Yet there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish, as in the former time. He degraded the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, so afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

2. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; they who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light has shined.

3. You have multiplied the nation. You have not increased the joy. They rejoice before You according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

4. For You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.

5. For every boot of the warrior is with commotion, and the coat rolled in blood shall be burning fuel for the fire.

6. For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and the government shall be on His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

7. There is no end of the increase of His government and peace on the throne of David, and on His kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on, even forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.   

8. The Lord sent a word to Jacob, and it has fallen on Israel.

9. And all the people shall know, Ephraim and the people of Samaria, who say in pride and hardness of heart,

10. The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with cut stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we use cedars instead.

11. And the LORD shall set up the foes of Rezin against him, and spur on his enemies;

12. the Syrians in front and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

13. For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, nor do they seek the LORD of hosts.

14. And the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.

15. The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.

16. For the leaders of this people led them astray; and their guided ones are swallowed up.

17. For this the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor shall He have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

18. For wickedness burns like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall roll upwards like the lifting up of smoke.

19. Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land scorched, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall have pity on his brother.

20. And he shall cut off on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left, and they shall not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;

21. Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.  

## Isaiah 10

1. Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the scribes who write toil;

2. to turn aside the needy from judgment, and to steal the right from the poor of My people, that widows may be their prey, and they rob the orphans!

3. And what will you do in the day of judgment and in destruction? It comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?

4. Surely they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.   

5. Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My fury.

6. I will send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to take the plunder, and to strip off the spoil, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.

7. Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so. For it is in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.

8. For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?

9.  Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?

10. As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, and their graven images more than Jerusalem's and Samaria's;

11. shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?

12. And it will be, when the Lord has broken off all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looks.

13. For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am wise. And I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the people like a strong man.

14. And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was none who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

15. Shall the axe boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As if the rod could wave those who lift itself up! As if a staff could raise what is not wood!

16. Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory He shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.

17. And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.

18. And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.

19. And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a boy might write them.   

20. And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but truly lean on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.

21. The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

22. For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the full end which is decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

23. For the Lord Jehovah of hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.   

24. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah of hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.

25. But yet a little while, and the fury shall cease, and My anger shall be in their ruin.

26. And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip on him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His rod was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.

27. And it shall be, in that day his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

28. He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his baggage;

29. they have gone over the passage; they have bedded down at Geba; Ramah is afraid, Gibeah of Saul has fled.

30. Lift up your voice, daughter of heaps; shriek with your voice; bow Laish, afflicted of Anathoth.

31. Madmenah wanders; the people of Gebim take refuge.

32. Yet he shall remain in Nob today; he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror; and the lofty ones shall be cut down, and the proud shall be humbled.

34. And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.  

## Isaiah 11

1. And a Shoot goes out from the stump of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.

2. And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest on Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.

3. And He is made to breathe in the fear of the LORD. And He shall not judge according to the sight of His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears.

4. But with righteousness He shall judge the poor, and shall decide with uprightness for the meek of the earth. And He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.

5. And righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His heart.

6. Also the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the cub lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

7. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

8. And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.

9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.   

10. And in that day there shall be the Root of Jesse standing for a banner of the people; to Him the nations shall seek; and His resting place shall be glorious.

11. And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall again set His hand, the second time, to recover the remnant of His people that remains, from Assyria and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Ethiopia, and from Persia, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the coasts of the sea.

12. And He shall lift up a banner for the nations, and shall gather the outcasts of Israel and gather together the scattered ones of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

13. And the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the foes of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not trouble Ephraim.

14. But they shall fly on the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; they shall spoil the sons of the east together; they shall lay their hand on Edom and Moab; and the sons of Ammon shall obey them.

15. And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with His scorching wind He shall shake His hand over the River, and shall strike it into seven streams, and make one tread it with shoes.

16. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, those left from Assyria; as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.  

## Isaiah 12

1. And in that day you shall say, O LORD, I will praise You; though You were angry with me, turn away Your anger, and You shall comfort me.

2. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; He also has become my salvation.

3. And with joy you shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.   

4. And in that day you shall say, Praise the LORD! Call on His name; declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted.

5. Sing to the LORD; for He has done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.

6. Cry out and shout, O dweller of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst.  

## Isaiah 13

1. The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:

2. Lift up a banner on a bare mountain, exalt the voice to them, shake the hand, so that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

3. I have commanded My holy ones, I have also called My mighty ones for anger, those who rejoice in My highness.

4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together; the LORD of hosts gathers an army for the battle.

5. They come from a far country, from the end of the heavens, the LORD and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy all land.   

6. Howl! For the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

7. Therefore all hands shall be faint, and every man's heart shall melt;

8. and they shall be afraid. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. They shall be in pain like a woman who travails. They shall be amazed at one another, their faces like flames.

9. Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel and with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land waste; and He shall destroy its sinners out of it.

10. For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give light; the sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not reflect its light.

11. And I will visit evil on the world, and their iniquity on the wicked. And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will lay low the pride of tyrants.

12. I will make a man more precious than gold; even a man than the fine gold of Ophir.

13. So I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall move out of its place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.

14. And it shall be as a driven gazelle, and as a sheep that no man takes up; each man shall look to his own people, and each one flee into his own land.

15. Everyone who is found shall be thrust through; and everyone who is joined to them shall fall by the sword.

16. And their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be robbed, and their wives raped.

17. Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not value silver; and they shall not delight in gold.

18. And bows shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not pity sons.   

19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the majestic beauty of the Chaldees, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It shall never be inhabited forever, nor shall it be lived in from generation to generation; nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there; nor shall the shepherds make their flocks lie down there.

21. But the wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of howling creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and he-goats shall dance there.

22. And hyenas shall cry along with his widows, and jackals in palaces of delight. Yea, her time is coming near, and her days shall not be prolonged.  

## Isaiah 14

1. For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel and set them in their own land; and the stranger shall be joined with them, and they shall cling to the house of Jacob.

2. And the peoples shall take them and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for slaves and slave girls. And they shall be captives of their captors; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

3. And it shall be in the day that the LORD shall give you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear, and from the hard bondage which was pressed on you,   

4. you shall take up this song against the king of Babylon and say, How the exacter, the gold gatherer has ceased!

5. The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers

6. who struck peoples in wrath, a blow without turning away, ruling the nations in anger, a persecution without restraint.

7. All the earth is at rest and is quiet; they break out into singing.

8. Yea, the fir trees rejoice at you, the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you have fallen, no woodcutter will come up against us.

9. Hell from below is moved for you, to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the dead for you, all the he-goats of the earth. It has raised from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

10. All of them shall speak and say to you, Are you also as weak as we? Are you like us?

11. Your pride is brought down to the grave, and the noise of your harps. The maggot is spread under you, and the worms cover you.

12. How you are fallen from the heavens, O shining star, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!

13. For you have said in your heart, I will go up to the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.

14. I will go up above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.

15. Yet you shall be brought down to hell, to the sides of the Pit.

16. Those who see you shall stare and closely watch you, saying, Is this the man who made the earth to tremble; who shook kingdoms;

17.  who made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed its cities; who did not open the house for his prisoners?

18. All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

19. But you are cast out of your grave like a hateful branch, and like the clothing of those who are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trampled under foot.

20. You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you ruined your land and killed your people; the seed of evildoers shall never be famous.

21. Prepare slaughter for his sons, because of the iniquity of their fathers, so that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

22. For I will rise up against them, says the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, and son, and grandson, says the LORD.

23. I will also make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the broom of ruin, says the LORD of hosts.   

24. The LORD of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass; and as I have purposed, it shall stand;

25. to break Assyria in My land and on My mountains trample him under foot. Then his yoke shall be removed from them, and his burden shall be taken off their shoulders.

26. This is the purpose that is purposed on all the earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out on all the nations.

27. For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who shall reverse it? And this His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

28. This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died:

29. Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, that the rod of your striking is broken. For a viper comes forth from the root of a snake, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

30. And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.

31. Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! O Philistia, all of you, are melted away; for from the north a smoke comes, and no straggler in his ranks.

32. What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD has founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall trust in it.  

## Isaiah 15

1. The burden of Moab. Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off; because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off.

2. One has gone up to the house, even to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba; baldness shall be on all their heads, every beard cut off.

3. In the streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, everyone shall howl, melting in tears.

4. And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz. So the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life is broken to him.

5. My heart shall cry to Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar, a heifer of three years. He goes up the ascent to Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of ruin.   

6. For the waters of Nimrim are desolation; for the hay has dried up and the grass fails, there is no green thing.

7. Therefore one made up the remainder and their store; over the torrent of the willows they shall carry them.

8. For the cry has gone around the border of Moab, its howling even to Eglaim; yea, its howling even to Beer-elim.

9. For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will put on Dimon more things for the escaped ones of Moab, a lion, even for the remnant of the land.  

## Isaiah 16

1. Send the lamb to the ruler of the land from the rock of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Zion.

2. For it shall be as a fleeing bird cast out of the nest, the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

3. Take counsel, do judgment; make your shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; do not betray the fugitive.

4. Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be a shelter to them from the face of the destroyer; for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

5. And in mercy the throne shall be established; and he shall sit on it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and speeding righteousness.   

6. We have heard of the pride of Moab; very proud; even of his vanity, and his pride, and his rage; not so are his babblings.

7. So Moab shall howl for Moab, everyone shall howl. All of it shall howl for the foundations of Kir-hareseth; surely they are stricken.

8. For Heshbon's fields droop, the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have crushed its choice plants, they have come to Jazer, they wander in the desert; her branches are stretched out, they have crossed the sea.

9. On account of this I will weep with the weeping of Jazer, the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouting has fallen on your fruit and on your harvest.

10. And gladness and joy are gathered out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing and no shouting. The treader shall tread out no wine in the presses; I have made their shouting to cease.

11. Therefore my belly shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my bowels for Kir-hareseth.

12. And it shall be when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, he shall come to his sacred place to pray; but he shall not be able.

13. This is the word that the LORD has spoken to Moab since that time.

14. But now the LORD has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be abased with all that great host and the remnant few; small, not mighty.  

## Isaiah 17

1. The burden against Damascus: Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a heap of ruins.

2. The cities of Aroer are forsaken; now they are for flocks; they shall lie down, and no one terrifies them.

3. And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the rest of Syria. They shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel, says the LORD of hosts.

4. And it shall be in that day, the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.

5. And it shall be as reaping of the harvest grain, and his arm reaps the ears. And it shall be as he who gathers ears in the Valley of the Giants.   

6. Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three ripe olives in the top of the uppermost branch, four or five in the fruit-tree branches of it, says the LORD God of hosts.

7. In that day a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

8. And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor respect that which his fingers have made, either the Asherahs or the images.   

9. In that day his strong cities shall be like a forsaken branch, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the sons of Israel; and it will become a ruin.

10. Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, therefore you shall plant pleasant plants and shall sow it a fresh shoot.

11. In the day of your planting you fence it in; and in the morning you make your seed sprout. But the harvest shall be a heap in that day of grief and dying pain.   

12. Woe to the multitude of many people, who make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations who make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

13. The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

14. At evening time, behold, terror! Before the morning, he is not! This is the lot of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.  

## Isaiah 18

1. Woe to the land of whirring of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,

2. which sends ambassadors by the sea, even in ships of papyrus on the waters, saying, Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a terrifying people from it and onwards; a mighty nation and trampling down, whose land the rivers have divided!

3. All people of the world and dwellers on the earth, you will see as one lifts up a banner on the peaks. And you will hear as the blowing of a trumpet.

4. For so the LORD said to me, I will take My rest, and I will look on in My dwelling place, like a clear heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

5. For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.

6. They shall be left together to the birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the birds shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.

7. In that time shall be brought to the LORD of hosts the present from a terrifying, a tall and smooth people, from it and onward; a mighty and trampling nation whose land the rivers have divided, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, Mount Zion.  

## Isaiah 19

1. The burden against Egypt: Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and comes into Egypt. And the idols of Egypt shall tremble at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its midst.

2. And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians; and they shall fight each man against his brother, and each against his neighbor; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

3. And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it, and I will destroy its wisdom. And they shall seek to idols, and to the enchanters, and to the mediums, and to the future-tellers.

4. And I will shut up Egypt into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord, The LORD of hosts.

5. And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall fail and dry up.

6. And rivers shall be fouled; the Nile of Egypt will languish and dry up; the reed and the rush shall decay.

7. Bare places shall be at the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile, and everything sown by the Nile shall dry up, driven away, and be no more.

8. The fishermen also shall mourn, and all who drop a hook into the Nile shall wail, and those who spread nets on the waters shall droop.

9. And the workers in fine flax, and the weavers of white cloth shall be ashamed.

10. And her foundations shall be broken, and all who make wages shall be sad of soul.

11. Surely the rulers of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish. How do you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

12. Where are they? Where are your wise men? And let them tell you now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts has planned against Egypt.

13. The rulers of Zoan have become fools, the rulers of Noph are deceived; they have also caused Egypt to go astray, the chief of her tribes.

14. The LORD has mixed a perverse spirit in its midst; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all its work, like a drunkard staggers in his vomit.

15. And Egypt shall have no work that the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.

16. In that day Egypt shall be like women; and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He shakes over it.

17. And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it shall be afraid toward it, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts, which He has purposed against it.   

18. In that day five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called the City of Ruin.

19. In that day there shall be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the LORD.

20. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and He shall send them a deliverer, and a great one, and will deliver them.

21. And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and Egypt shall know the LORD in that day, and shall offer sacrifice and offering; and vow a vow to the LORD, and repay.

22. And the LORD shall strike Egypt; He shall strike and heal; and they shall return to the LORD, and He shall hear them and shall heal them.

23. In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.

24. In that day Israel shall be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land;

25. whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be My people Egypt, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.  

## Isaiah 20

1. In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod and took it;

2. at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off your loins, and take your shoe off your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

3. And the LORD said, Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years, a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;

4. so shall the king of Assyria lead away Egypt's prisoners, and the Ethiopian exiles, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with uncovered buttocks, to the shame of Egypt.

5. And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their hope, and of Egypt their glory.

6. And he who lives in this coast shall say in that day, Behold, this has become of our hope to which we fled for help there, to be delivered from before the king of Assyria; and, How shall we escape?  

## Isaiah 21

1. The burden against the desert of the sea: As tempests in the south pass, it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.

2. A harsh vision is revealed to me; the deceiver deceives, and the plunderer plunders. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media! I have caused all her sighing to cease.

3. Therefore my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold on me like the pangs of a woman who travails; I was bowed down from hearing; I was troubled from seeing.

4. My heart wanders, terror overwhelms me; He has turned the twilight of my pleasure into trembling.

5. Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink; arise, rulers. Anoint the shield.

6. For so the LORD has said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.

7. And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, a chariot of an ass, and a chariot of a camel. And let him listen, very attentively.

8. And he cried, A lion! My lord, without ceasing, I stand on the watchtower by day, and I am stationed at my post all the nights.

9. And, behold, here comes a chariot of a man, a pair of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon has fallen, has fallen! And all the graven images of her gods He has smashed to the ground.

10. O my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.   

11. The burden against Dumah: He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

12. The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night; if you will inquire, inquire, and come again.   

13. The burden against Arabia: You shall stay in the forest of Arabia, O traveling companies of Dedanites.

14. The people of the land of Tema brought water to him who was thirsty; they went before him who fled with their bread.

15. For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the press of war.

16. For so has the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;

17. and the rest of the number of archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, shall be cut down; for the LORD God of Israel has spoken.  

## Isaiah 22

1. The burden against the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you have gone up to the housetops?

2. Crashings fill the noisy city, the joyous city Your slain ones are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.

3. All your rulers fled together; they were bound without the bow; all found in you are bound together; they have fled from afar.

4. Therefore I said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; do not hurry to comfort me because of the ruin of the daughter of my people.

5. For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling down, and of doubt by the LORD God of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountain.

6. And Persia carried the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.

7. And it happened, your choicest valleys were full of chariots; and the horsemen surely set in order at the gate.   

8. And he removed Judah's covering, and you looked in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.

9. You have seen also the breaks in the city of David, that they are many; and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.

10. And you have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you have broken down the houses to fortify the wall.

11. You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but you have not looked to its Maker, nor see Him who formed it long ago.

12. And in that day the LORD of hosts called to weeping and mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.

13. Then, lo, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, saying, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!

14. And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you until you die, says the Lord Jehovah of hosts.   

15. So says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, Go, go up to this treasurer, to Shebna who is over the house. Say,

16. What is to you here? And who is here to you, that you have carved out a tomb for yourself here, as one who cuts himself out a tomb on high, who cuts out a home for himself in a rock?

17. Behold, the LORD will hurl you with a hurling, O man, and grasps you with a grasping.

18. Whirling, He will whirl you like a ball into a large country; there you shall die, and there are the chariots of your glory, the shame of your lord's house.

19. And I will drive you from your position, and he will pull you from your station.

20. And in that day it shall be, even I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.

21. and I will clothe him with your robe, and will fasten your girdle on him, and I will give your authority into his hand. And he shall be a father to the people of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

22. And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.

23. And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

24. And they shall hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the offshoots, all small vessels, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of jars.

25. In that day, says the LORD of hosts, the nail that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed, and be cut down, and fall. And the burden that was on it shall be cut off. The LORD has spoken.  

## Isaiah 23

1. The burden against Tyre: Howl, ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

2. Be still, inhabitants of the coast, merchant of Sidon, who pass over the sea. They have filled you.

3. And by great waters, the seed of Sihor and the harvest of the river Nile was her revenue; and she a mart of nations.

4. Be ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the strength of the sea, saying, I have not travailed nor brought forth. I have not nourished young men nor raised up virgins.

5. As the report comes to Egypt, so they shall be grieved at the report of Tyre.

6. Pass over Tarshish. Howl, inhabitants of the coast!

7.  Is this your joyous city from days of her old age? Her own feet carry it afar off to stay.

8. Who has purposed this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are rulers, whose merchants are the weighty of the earth?

9. The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the weighty of the earth.

10. Pass through your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more strength.

11. He stretched out His hand over the sea; He shook kingdoms. The LORD has made a decree against the merchant city, to destroy its forts.

12. And He said, You shall rejoice no more, O crushed one, virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Chittim; also there you shall have no rest.

13. Behold the land of the Chaldeans! This people did not exist. Assyria founded it for those who live in the desert. They set up their siege-towers; they stripped its palaces. They made it a ruin.

14. Howl, ships of Tarshish! For your strength is laid waste.   

15. And in that day Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will be as the song of a harlot to Tyre.

16. Take a harp, go about the city, O harlot who has been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs so that you may be remembered.

17. And it will be, after the end of seventy years the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.

18. And her goods and her wages shall be holiness to the LORD. It shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her goods shall be for those who dwell before the LORD, to eat enough, and for a choice covering.  

## Isaiah 24

1. Behold, the LORD empties the land and makes it bare, and distorts its face, and scatters its inhabitants.

2. And as it is with the people, so it shall be with the priest; as with the servant, so with the master; as with the handmaid, so it is with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.

3. The land shall be completely emptied, and utterly stripped; for the LORD has spoken this word.

4. The earth mourns and languishes; the world droops and languishes; the proud people of the earth droop.

5. And the land is defiled under its people; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, and have broken the everlasting covenant.

6. Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and they who dwell in it are deserted; therefore the people of the earth are burned, and few men left.

7. The new wine mourns, the vine droops, all the merry-hearted sigh.

8. The gladness of tambourines ceases, the noise of those who rejoice ends; the joy of the harp ceases.

9. They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.

10. The city of shame is broken down; every house is shut up so that no one may come in.

11. A crying for wine is in the streets; all joy is darkened, the gladness in the land has gone.

12. In the city is left desolation, and the gate is stricken with ruin.   

13. For so it is in the midst of the land among the people, it shall be like the shaking of an olive tree and as gleanings when the grape harvest is completed.

14. They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

15. Therefore glorify the LORD in the flames, the name of the Lord Jehovah of Israel in the coasts of the sea.   

16. From the ends of the earth we have heard songs, glory to the righteous. But I said, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! Deceivers deceive, even perfidy. Deceivers deceive!

17. Dread, and the pit, and the snare are on you, O dweller of the earth.

18. And it shall be, he who flees from the sound of dread shall fall into the pit. And he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare. For the windows from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake.

19. The earth is breaking, breaking! The earth is crashing, crashing! The earth is tottering, tottering!

20. Like a drunkard the earth is staggering, staggering! And it rocks to and fro like a tree-hut! And its sins heavy on it; and it shall fall and not rise again.

21. And it shall be in that day, the LORD shall punish the host of the high place on high, and on the kings of the earth on the earth.

22. And they shall be gathered, as prisoners are gathered in a dungeon. And they shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be judged.

23. Then the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, and gloriously before His elders.  

## Isaiah 25

1. O LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise Your name; for You have done a wonder; Counsels from afar; faithful faithfulness.

2. For You have made a heap from a city; a fortified city into a ruin; a citadel of foreigners to be no city; it shall never be built.

3. Therefore the strong people glorify You, the city of the fearful nations shall fear You.

4. For You are a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the fearful ones is like a storm against the wall.

5. You shalt bring down the noise of foreigners, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of cloud. The shouting of the terrifying ones shall be brought low.   

6. And in this mountain the LORD of hosts shall make a feast of fat things for all the people, a feast of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of refined wine on the lees.

7. And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering which covers all people, and the veil that is woven over all nations.

8. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces. And He shall take away from all the earth the rebuke of His people. For the LORD has spoken.   

9. And one shall say in that day, Lo, this is our God. We have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is the LORD; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.

10. For the hand of the LORD shall rest in this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled under Him, even as straw is trampled in the water of a dung pit.

11. And He shall spread out His hands in their midst, as he who swims strokes to swim. And He shall bring down their pride with the skill of His hands.

12. And the fortress of the high fort of your walls He will lay low, bring to the ground, to the dust.  

## Isaiah 26

1. In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; He sets up salvation as our walls and banks.

2. Open the gates, and the righteous nation shall enter in, keeping faithfulness.

3. You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You; because he trusts in You.

4. Trust in the LORD forever; for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.   

5. For He brings down those who dwell on high; He lays low the lofty city; He lays it low, even to the ground; He brings it to the dust.

6. The foot shall trample it, the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy.

7. The way of the just is uprightness; O Upright One, weigh the path of the just.

8. Yea, in the way of Your judgments, O LORD, we awaited You; for Your name and for Your memory is the desire of our soul.

9.  With my soul I desired You in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I will seek You early; for when Your judgments are in the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.

10. Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

11. LORD, Your hand is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy toward Your people. Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them.   

12. LORD, You will ordain peace for us; for You also have worked all our works in us.

13. O LORD our God, lords besides You have had the rule over us; but by You only will we make mention of Your name.

14. Dead ones do not live; departed spirits do not rise. Therefore You have visited and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.

15. You have increased the nation, O LORD, You have increased the nation; You are glorified; You have extended all the ends of the land.

16. LORD, in trouble they have visited You; they poured out a prayer; Your chastening was on them.

17. As a woman with child draws near to bear, she is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in Your sight, O LORD.

18. We conceived; we have been in pain, we gave birth to wind. We have not brought about any salvation in the earth; nor have the people of the world fallen.

19. Your dead ones shall live, together with my dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is as the dew of lights, and the earth shall cast out the dead.   

20. Come, my people, enter into your rooms and shut your doors around you; hide for a little moment, until the fury has passed by.

21. For behold, the LORD comes out of His place to punish the people of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall reveal her blood, and shall no more cover her dead.  

## Isaiah 27

1. In that day the LORD with His great and fierce and strong sword shall punish the sea-monster, the darting serpent, the sea-monster, that twisting serpent; and He shall kill the monster in the sea.

2. In that day sing to her, a delightful vineyard.

3. I the LORD keep it; I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

4. Fury is not in Me; who would set the briers and thorns against Me in battle? I would step through it; I would burn it at once.

5. Or let them take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.

6. He shall cause those who come from Jacob to take root; Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.   

7. Has He stricken him, as He struck those who struck Him? Is He slain according to the slaughter of the slain by Him?

8. By driving her away, you will contend with her; by sending her away, You punished her. He takes away by His rough wind, in the day of the east wind.

9. By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces, the Asherahs and sun-pillars shall not stand up.

10. Yet the fortified city shall be wasted, and the dwelling forsaken and left like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down and eat up its branches.

11. When its branches are dried up, they shall be broken off; the women come and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore His Maker will not have mercy on them, and He who formed them will not favor them.

12. And it shall be, in that day the LORD shall thresh from the stream of the river Euphrates to the brook of Egypt, and you shall be gathered one by one, O sons of Israel.

13. And it shall be, in that day the great ram's horn shall be blown, and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and shall worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.  

## Isaiah 28

1. Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which is on the head of the fat valleys of those who are overcome with wine!

2. Behold, the Lord is a mighty and strong one, like a hailstorm, a destroying storm; like a flood of mighty waters overflowing, He casts down to the earth with the hand.

3. The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trampled under foot;

4. and the glorious beauty, on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the first-ripe fruit before the summer; which the beholder of it swallows up while it is yet in his hand.

5. In that day the LORD of hosts shall be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the rest of His people,

6. and for a spirit of judgment to him who sits in judgment, and for strength to those who turn back the battle to the gate.

7. But they also have sinned through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way. The priest and the prophet have sinned through drink; they are swallowed up by wine; they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

8. For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness; no place is clean.   

9. Whom shall He teach knowledge? And whom shall He make to understand doctrine? Those weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts.

10. For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little;

11. for with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people.

12. To whom He said, This is the rest; cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing. Yet they were not willing to hear.

13. But the word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken and snared and taken.   

14. Therefore hear the word of the LORD, scornful men who rule this people in Jerusalem.

15. Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we have made a vision with hell; when the overwhelming rod shall pass through, it shall not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood,

16. therefore so says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I place in Zion a Stone for a foundation, a tried Stone, a precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation; he who believes shall not hurry.

17. Also I will lay judgment to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

18. And your covenant with death shall be wiped out, and your vision with hell shall not stand; when the overwhelming rod shall pass through, then you shall be beaten down by it.

19. From the time that it goes out it shall take you; for morning by morning it shall pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be nothing less than a terror to give ear to the message.

20. For the bed is shorter than one can stretch himself on, and the cover is narrower than one can wrap himself in.

21. For the LORD shall rise up as in Mount Perazim; He shall be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, so that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.

22. So then do not be mockers, lest your bands be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts that a full end is decreed on all the earth.   

23. Give ear and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.

24. Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he open and break the clods of his ground?

25. When he has made the face of it level, does he not cast out the dill and scatter the cummin, and throw in the choice wheat and the chosen barley and the spelt in its border?

26. For his God instructs him to do right; his God teaches him.

27. For the dill is not threshed with a threshing instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned on cummin; but the dill is beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod.

28. Bread grain is crushed, but not always does one thresh it with threshing. And he drives the wheel of his cart; and his horses do not beat it small.

29. This also comes out from the LORD of hosts, who is wonderful in wisdom, making sound wisdom great.  

## Isaiah 29

1. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! Add year to year; let them kill their sacrifices.

2. Then I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow; and it shall be to me as Ariel.

3. And I will camp against you all around, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.

4. And you shall be brought down; you shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be like a spiritist, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.

5. And the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away; yea, it shall be at an instant, suddenly.

6. You shall be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake and great noise, with storm and whirlwind, and the flame of devouring fire.

7. And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be like a dream of a night vision.

8. It shall even be as when a hungry one dreams, and behold, he eats, but he wakes and his soul is empty; or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint and his soul is longing. So shall it be with the multitude of all the nations who fight against mount Zion.   

9. Stand still and wonder! Blind your eyes and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

10. For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes; He has covered the prophets and your heads, the seers.

11. And the vision of all has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which they give to one who knows books saying, Please read this; and he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.

12. And the book is delivered to him who does not know books, saying, Please read this; and he says, I do not know books.

13. And the LORD said, Because this people draw near Me with their mouth, and with their lips honor Me, but have removed their heart far from Me, and their fear toward Me is taught by the command of men;

14. therefore, behold, I will go on doing among this people, a wonder, even a wonder. For the wisdom of their wise ones shall perish, and the understanding of their intelligent ones shall be hidden.

15. Woe to those who go deep to hide their purpose from the LORD! And their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? And who knows us?

16. O your perversity! Shall the former be counted as the potter's clay; for shall the work say of him who made it, He did not make me? Or shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, He had no understanding?   

17.  Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be counted as a forest?

18. And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of their gloom and darkness.

19. And the meek shall increase joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

20. For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is destroyed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off;

21. those who make a man guilty by a word, and lay a trap for the reprover in the gate, and turn aside the just for a worthless thing.

22. Therefore so says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now become pale.

23. But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, they shall sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy one of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

24. Those who erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmured shall learn doctrine.  

## Isaiah 30

1. Woe to the rebellious sons, says the LORD, who make advice, but not of Me; and who cover with a covering, but not of My Spirit, that they add sin to sin;

2. those who set out to go down to Egypt and have not asked at My mouth; to take refuge in the strength of Pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

3. Therefore the strength of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt shall be your curse.

4. For his rulers were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

5. They were all ashamed of a people who could not profit them, nor be a help nor gain, but a shame and also a reproach.

6. The burden concerning the beasts of the south. Into the land of trouble and woe. The lioness and the lion are from them; the viper, and the fiery flying serpent. They carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit.

7. For Egypt helps vainly, and worthlessly. So I have cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.   

8. Now go, write it before them in a tablet, and note it in a book, so that it may be for the time to come forever and ever,

9. that this is a rebellious people, lying sons. They are sons who will not hear the law of the LORD;

10. who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy falsehood;

11. go out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

12. Therefore so says the Holy One of Israel, Because you have despised this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rest on them;

13. therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant.

14. And He shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces. He shall have no pity, so that there shall not be found in the breaking of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit.

15. For so says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest you shall be saved; and in quietness and hope shall be your strength. And you were not willing.

16. But you said, No; for we will flee on a horse. Therefore you shall flee. And you said, We will ride on the swift; therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.

17. One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five you shall flee, until you are left as a pole on the top of a mountain, and as a sign on a hill.   

18. And so the LORD waits to be gracious to you. And therefore He is exalted, that He may have mercy on you. For the LORD is a God of judgment; blessed are all those who wait for Him.

19. For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more; He will be very gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When He hears it, He will answer you.

20. And the LORD gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction; yet your teachers shall not be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers.

21. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk in it, when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left.

22. You shall also defile the covering of your graven images of silver, and the ornament of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away like a menstruous cloth. You shall say to it, Get away.

23. Then He shall give the rain for your seed, with which you sow the ground. And the bread of the produce of the earth also shall be fat and plentiful. In that day your cattle shall feed in large pastures.

24. Also the oxen and the young asses that plow the ground shall eat clean fodder, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.

25. And there shall be on every high mountain, and on every high hill, rivers, streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

26. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the break of His people and heals the stroke of their wound.   

27. Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with His anger, and uplifting of smoke; His lips are full of fury, and His tongue like a devouring fire.

28. And like an overflowing stream, His breath shall reach to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity. And a bridle will be in the jaws of the people, causing them to go astray.

29. You shall have a song, as in the keeping of a holy feast night; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

30. And the LORD shall cause His glorious voice to be heard, and the bringing down of His arm shall be seen with raging anger and flame of a devouring fire, cloudburst and storm and hailstones.

31. For through the voice of the LORD, the Assyrian shall be beaten down, who struck with a rod.

32. And in every place which the ordained staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay on him, it shall be with tambourines and harps; in battles of shaking He will fight with them.

33. For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared. He has made it deep and large. He makes great with fire and wood. The breath of the LORD kindles it, like a torrent of brimstone.  

## Isaiah 31

1. Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and lean on horses and trust in chariots, because it is great; and in horsemen, because they are so very strong, but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor do they seek the LORD!

2. Yet He also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back His words, but will arise against the house of evil-doers and against the help of those who work iniquity.

3. And Egypt is a man, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not Spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall down, and they shall all cease together.

4. For so has the LORD spoken to me: As the lion roars, even the young lion on his prey when a multitude of shepherds are gathered against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise. So the LORD of hosts shall come down to fight for Mount Zion, and on its hill.

5. As birds flying, so the LORD of hosts will defend Jerusalem; also defending, He will deliver it; and passing over He will preserve it.   

6. Turn to Him from whom the sons of Israel have deeply revolted.

7. For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you, a sin.

8. Then Assyria shall fall with the sword, not of great man; and the sword, not of lowly man, shall devour him. For he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor.

9. And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his rulers shall be afraid of the banner, says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.  

## Isaiah 32

1. Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and rulers shall rule in judgment.

2. And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a shelter from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

3. And the eyes of those who see shall not be dim, and the ears of those who hear shall listen.

4. And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stutter shall be ready to speak plainly.

5. The fool shall no more be called noble, nor the miser said to be bountiful.

6. For the fool will speak folly, and his heart work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy and to speak error against the LORD, to make the soul of the hungry empty, and he will take away the drink of the thirsty.

7. Also the weapons of the fool are evil; he thinks of wicked ways to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaks right.

8. But the noble thinks noble things; and by noble things he shall stand.   

9. Rise up, women who are at ease; hear my voice, careless daughters; listen to my speech.

10. Many days and years you shall be troubled, careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

11. Tremble, women at ease; be troubled, careless ones; strip yourselves and make yourselves bare, and bind sackcloth on your loins.

12. They shall mourn for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

13. On the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city;

14. because the palace shall be deserted, the multitude of the city shall be forsaken; instead the mound and tower shall be for dens forever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks

15. until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is thought to be a forest.

16. Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.

17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the work of righteousness shall be quietness and hope forever.

18. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable home, and in secure dwellings and quiet resting places

19. Though it hails, when the forest is felled, and the city laid low.

20. Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the feet of the ox and the ass.  

## Isaiah 33

1. Woe to the destroyer, and you who have not been destroyed; and betrayer, and they have not betrayed you. When you stop destroying, you shall be destroyed. When you stop betraying, they shall betray you.

2. O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for You; be their arm in the mornings; our salvation also in the time of trouble.

3. At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of Yourself the nations were scattered.

4. And your spoil shall be gathered as the stripping locust gathers; as the running to and fro of locusts he shall run on them.

5. The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high. He has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.

6. And He will be the security of your times, and strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is his treasure.

7. Behold, their mighty ones shall cry outside; the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.

8. The highways lie waste, the traveler ceases. He has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He cared for no man.

9. The earth mourns and droops. Lebanon is ashamed; Sharon withers like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken out.

10. Now I will rise, says the LORD; now I will be exalted; now I will lift up Myself.

11. You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring out stubble; your breath, like fire, shall devour you.

12. And the people shall be like the burnings of lime; like thorns cut up, they shall be burned in the. fire.   

13. You who are far off, hear what I have done; and you near ones, know My might.

14. The sinners in Zion are afraid; terror has surprised profane ones. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

15. He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands free from holding bribes, who stops his ear from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;

16. He shall dwell on high; his refuge shall be the strongholds of rocks; bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.

17. Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.

18. Your heart shall dwell on terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the one weighing? Where is he who counting the towers?

19. You shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than you can understand; of a foreign tongue that no one understands.

20. Look on Zion, the city of our holy meetings; your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet home, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, nor shall any of its cords be broken.

21. But there the glorious LORD will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars shall go, nor shall mighty ship pass by it.

22. For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; He will save us.

23. Your ropes are loosened, they do not hold the base of the mast; they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil shall be divided; the lame take the prey.

24. And an inhabitant, the people who live in it shall not say, I am sick; iniquity is taken away.  

## Isaiah 34

1. Come near, nations, to hear; and, you people, listen; let the earth hear, and its fullness; the world, and its offspring.

2. For the anger of the LORD is on all nations, and His fury on all their armies. He has completely destroyed them, He has delivered them to the slaughter.

3. Also their dead shall be thrown out, and their stink shall come up out of their dead bodies, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

4. And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled like a scroll; and all their host shall droop, as a leaf falls off from the vine, and as the falling from the fig tree.

5. For My sword bathed in the heavens. Behold, it shall come down on Edom, and on the people of My curse for judgment.

6. The sword of the LORD is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

7. And the wild oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

8. For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, the year to repay for the fighting against Zion.   

9. And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust to brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.

10. It shall not be put out night or day; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none passes through it forever and forever.

11. But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also, and the raven, shall dwell in it. And He shall stretch out on it the line of shame, and the stones of emptiness.

12. They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her rulers shall be nothing.

13. And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it shall be a home of jackals and a court for ostriches.

14. The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the howling beasts; and the shaggy goat shall cry to his fellow. The screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

15. There the snake shall nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow; there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.

16. Seek out of the book of the LORD, and read; not one of these shall fail, none shall lack its mate; for My mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.

17. And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it to them by line; they shall possess it forever, from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.  

## Isaiah 35

1. The wilderness and the desert shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the crocus.

2. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the honor of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD and the majesty of our God.

3. Make the weak hands strong and make the feeble knees sure.

4. Say to those of a hasty heart, Be strong, fear not; behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the full dealing of God. He will come and save you.   

5. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

6. Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness waters shall break out, and streams in the desert.

7. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land shall become springs of water in the home of jackals, in its lair, and a place for the reed and rush.

8. And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it. But He shall be with them; the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err in it.

9. No lion shall be there, nor any beast of prey shall go up on it; it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there.

10. And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.  

## Isaiah 36

1. And it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.

2. And the king of Assyria sent the chief of the cupbearers from Lachish to Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the Fuller's Field.

3. Then Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah, the recorder, came out to him.

4. And the chief of the cupbearers said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, So says the great king, the king of Assyria, What hope is this in which you trust?

5. I say, Are only words of the lips wisdom and strength for war? Now, in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?

6. Lo, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which, if a man lean on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

7. But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?

8. Now then, please exchange pledges with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able on your part to set riders on them for you.

9. How then will you turn away the face of one commander of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

10. Have I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.   

11. And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the chief of the cupbearers, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. But do not speak to us in Jewish in the ears of the people on the wall.

12. But the chief of the cupbearers said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall? that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?

13. Then the chief of the cupbearers stood and cried with a loud voice in Jewish, and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

14. So says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.

15. Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.

16. Do not listen to Hezekiah; for so says the king of Assyria, Make a blessing with me by a present, and come out to me; and let everyone eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern,

17. until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

18.  Let not Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

19. Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

20. Who among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

21. But they were silent and did not answer him a word, for the king's command, saying, Do not answer him.

22. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the chief of the cupbearers.  

## Isaiah 37

1. And it happened when king Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.

2. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

3. And they said to him, So says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy! For the sons have come to the birth, and no strength to bring out.

4. It may be the LORD your God will hear the words of the chief of the cupbearers, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard. And you shall lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.

5. So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said to them, So you shall say to your master, So says the LORD, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.

7. Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.   

8. So the chief of the cupbearers returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah. For he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.

9. And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to war with you. And he heard and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. So you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11. Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by completely destroying them. And shall you be delivered?

12. Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

13. Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter from the courier's hand, and read it. And Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying,

16. O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, who dwells between the cherubs, You are He, God, You alone to all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.

17. Bow down Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib which he has sent to mock the living God.

18. Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their land,

19. and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; so they have destroyed them.

20. And now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD, You alone.   

21. And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, So says the LORD God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

22. this is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him: The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you.

23. Whom have you mocked and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.

24. By your servants you have mocked the LORD and have said, by my many chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and its choice fir trees; and I will go to its greatest height, the forest of its Carmel.

25. I have dug and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.

26. Have you not heard from afar? I made it from days of old, even I have formed it? Now I have caused it to come, and you are to cause fortified cities to crash into heaps, ruins.

27. And their inhabitants were short of hand; dismayed and ashamed. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, even grain blasted before it has risen.

28. But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against Me.

29. Because of your raging against Me, and your arrogance has come up into My ears, therefore I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way which you came.

30. And this shall be a sign to you: You shall eat self-sown grain this year; and the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year you shall sow, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.

31. The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward;

32. for out of Jerusalem shall go out a remnant, and those who escape out of Mount Zion; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.

33. So the LORD says this to the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

34. By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and shall not come into this city, says the LORD.

35. For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.

36. Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. And they rose early in the morning, and behold! They were all dead corpses.

37. And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.

38. And it happened as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword. And they escaped into the land of Ararat; and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his place.  

## Isaiah 38

1. In those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, So says the LORD, Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.

2. Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD,

3. and said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart, and have done the good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.

4. Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go and say to Hezekiah: So says the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.

6. And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. And I will defend this city.

7. And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do this thing that He has spoken:

8. behold, I will bring again the shadow of the steps, which has gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten steps backward. So the sun returned ten steps, by which steps it had gone down.   

9. The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:

10. I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave; I have numbered the rest of my years.

11. I said, I shall not see Jah, Jehovah, in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more with the people of the world.

12. My generation is departed and removed from me like a shepherd's tent; I have cut off my life like a weaver; He will cut me off from the loom; from day even to night You will make an end of me.

13. I place Him before me until morning, that, as a lion, so He breaks all my bones; from day even until night You make an end of me.

14. Like a twittering swallow, so I chatter; I mourn as a dove; my eyes look weakly to the heights. O LORD, I am pressed down; be surety for me.

15. What shall I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has acted; I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

16. O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these is the life of my spirit; so You will recover me, and make me to live.

17. Behold, I had great bitterness for peace; but You loved my soul from the pit of destruction. You have cast all my sins behind Your back.

18. For the grave cannot praise You, death can not rejoice in You; they who go down into the pit cannot hope for Your truth.

19. The living, the living, he shall praise You, as I do this day; the father shall make Your truth known to the sons.

20. For the LORD is for my salvation; and we will sing my songs on the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.

21. For Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs and rub it on the ulcer; and he will live.

22. And Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?  

## Isaiah 39

1. At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.

2. And Hezekiah rejoiced over them, and let them see the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not let them see.

3. Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And where did they come from to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country to me, from Babylon.

4. Then he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house they have seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not let them see.   

5. Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:

6. Behold, the days come when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD.

7. And of your sons which shall issue from you, which you shall bring out, they shall take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

8. Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.  

## Isaiah 40

1. Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.

2. Speak lovingly to the heart of Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is done, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.   

3. The voice of him who cries in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the LORD, make straight a highway in the desert for our God.

4. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made level, and the rough places smooth;

5. and the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.

6. The voice said, Cry! And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the beauty of it is as the flower of the field.

7. The grass withers, the flower fades, because the Spirit of the LORD blows on it; surely the people is grass.

8. The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God shall stand forever.   

9. Go up for yourself on the high mountain, bringer of good tidings to Zion. Lift up your voice with strength, O you who bring good tidings to Jerusalem; lift up, do not be afraid. Say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

10. Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with a strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.

11. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those with young.   

12. Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured out the heavens with a span? And who has shut up the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

13. Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, and what man taught Him counsel?

14. With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him and taught Him in the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge, and made known the way of understanding to Him?

15. Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the scales; behold, He takes up the coastlands as a very little thing.

16. And Lebanon is not enough to burn, nor the beasts of it enough for a burnt offering.

17. All nations before Him are as nothing; and to Him they are thought to be less than nothing, and vanity.   

18. To whom then will you compare God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him?

19. The workman melts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and casts silver chains.

20. He too poor for that offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he looks for a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that will not totter.

21. Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

22.  It is He who sits on the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;

23. who brings the rulers to nothing; He makes the judges of the earth as vanity.

24. Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown. Yes, their stump shall not take root in the earth. And He shall also blow on them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away like stubble.

25. To whom then will you compare Me, or am I equaled? says the Holy One.

26. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold, who has created these, who brings out their host by number? He calls them all by names by the greatness of His might, for He is strong in power; not one is lacking.   

27. Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from the LORD and my judgment has passed over from my God?

28. Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow weak nor weary? There is no searching of His understanding.

29.  He gives power to the weary; and to him with no vigor; He increases strength.

30. Even the young shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall;

31. but those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.  

## Isaiah 41

1. Keep silence before Me, O coasts; and peoples shall renew strength; let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together for judgment.

2. Who raised up the righteous one from the east, called him to His foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? He gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.

3. He pursued them; he passed on in peace. He does not go by the way of his feet.

4. Who has planned and done it, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I the LORD am the first and the last; I am He.

5. The coastlands saw and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, and drew near, and came.

6. They each one helped his neighbor, and said to his brother, Be strong.

7. So the artisan strengthens the refiner, and he smoothing with the hammer, him who struck the anvil, saying of soldering, It is good. And he made it strong with nails; it will not totter.

8. But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, My friend;

9. whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you from its sides. And I said to you, You are My servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away.   

10. Do not fear; for I am with you; be not dismayed; for I am your God. I will make you strong; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.

11. Behold, all those who were angered against you shall be ashamed and confounded; they shall be as nothing. And those who fight with you shall perish.

12. You shall seek them, and shall not find them; men warring against you shall be as nothing, and as ceasing.

13. For I, the LORD your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, Do not fear; I will help you.

14. Do not fear, worm of Jacob and men of Israel; I will help you, says the LORD, and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

15. Behold, I make you a new sharp threshing instrument, a master of teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills like chaff.

16. You shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in the LORD and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.

17. The poor and needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue fails for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not leave them.

18. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

19. I will plant the cedar in the wilderness, the acacia tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree. I will set the fir tree in the desert, and the pine, and the box tree together;

20. so that they may see, and know, and look on, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.   

21. Bring near your cause, says the LORD; bring out your strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.

22. Let them bring them out, and tell us what shall happen; let them reveal the former things, what they are, that we may look on them and know the final end of them; or declare to us things to come.

23. Reveal the near things after this, so that we may know that you are gods. Yes, do good, or do evil, so that we may be amazed and see together.

24. Behold, you are of nothing, and your work of nothing. He who chooses you is an abomination.

25. I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come from the sunrise; he will call on My name. And he shall come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter tramples clay.

26. Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? And beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? Yea, no one declares; yea, no one proclaims; yea, no one hears your words.

27. I first shall say to Zion, Behold! Behold them! and I will give to Jerusalem one who bears good news.

28. For I looked, and there was no man; and of these no counselor was, that I might ask and they could answer.

29. Behold, they are all evil; their works are nothing; their images are wind and vanity.  

## Isaiah 42

1. Behold My Servant, whom I uphold; My Elect, in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit on Him; He shall bring out judgment to the nations.

2. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.

3. A bruised reed He shall not break, and a smoking wick He shall not quench; He shall bring out judgment to truth.

4. He shall not fail nor be discouraged until He has set judgment in the earth; and the coasts shall wait for His law.   

5. So says Jehovah God, He who created the heavens and stretched them out, spreading out the earth and its offspring; He who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk in it.

6. I the LORD have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You for a covenant of the people, for a Light of the nations;

7. to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness out of the prison house.

8. I am the LORD; that is My name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images.

9. Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they happen, I cause you to hear.

10. Sing to the LORD a new song; His praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and its fullness; coasts and their peoples.

11. Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice, the villages where Kedar dwells. Let the dwellers of the rock sing, let them shout from the mountain tops.

12. Give glory to the LORD and declare His praise in the coastlands.   

13. The LORD goes out as a warrior, He stirs up zeal like a man of wars; He shouts, yea, roars; He overcomes His enemies.

14. I have kept silence from forever; I have been still and refrained Myself. Now I will cry like a woman in pangs of labor, I will pant and gasp at once.

15. I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their plants. And I will make the rivers coastlands, and I will dry up the pools.

16. And I will bring the blind by a way they knew not; I will lead them in paths they have not known; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. I will do these things to them, and not forsake them.

17. They are turned back, they are greatly ashamed, those who trust in graven images and who say to the images, You are our gods.   

18. Hear, deaf ones; and blind ones look to see.

19. Who is blind but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger whom I sent? Who is blind as he who is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?

20. You see many things, but do not pay attention. Your ears are open, but not any hears.

21. The LORD is well pleased for His righteousness sake; He will magnify the Law and make it honorable.

22. But this is a people robbed and spoiled; all of them snared in holes, and they are hidden in prison-houses; they have been taken, and none delivers them; a prize, and none says, Give back.

23. Who among you will hear this? He will listen and hear for the time to come?

24. Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to robbers? Did not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, nor did they obey His law.

25. So He has poured on him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle. And it has set him on fire all around, yet he did not know; and it burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.  

## Isaiah 43

1. But now so says the LORD who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel; Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.

2. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; nor shall the flame kindle on you.

3. For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.

4. Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.

5. Fear not; for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.

6. I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not keep back; bring My sons from far and My daughters from the ends of the earth;

7. everyone who is called by My name; for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.   

8. Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.

9. Let all the nations be brought together, and let the people be gathered; who among them can declare this and make us hear former things? Let them bring out their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is true.

10. You are My witnesses, says the LORD, and My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me no God was formed, nor shall there be after Me.

11. I, I am the LORD; and there is none to save besides Me.

12. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shown, when there was no strange god among you; therefore you are My witnesses, says the LORD, that I am God.

13. Yea, before the day was, I am He; and no one delivers out of My hand; I will work, and who will reverse it?   

14. So says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all of them as fugitives, and the Chaldeans, whose shout is in the ships.

15. I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.

16. So says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters;

17. who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are put out, they are snuffed out like a wick.

18. Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.

19. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall sprout; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.

20. The beasts of the field shall honor Me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen.

21. This people that I formed for Myself; they shall declare My praise.   

22. But you have not called on Me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel.

23. You have not brought Me the lamb of your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.

24. You have bought Me no sweet cane with silver, nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.

25. I, I am He who blots out your sins for My own sake, and will not remember your sins.

26. Cause Me to remember; let us enter into judgment; declare yourself, that you may be justified.

27. Your first father has sinned, and your teachers have sinned against Me.

28. And I will defile rulers of the sanctuary, and will give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.  

## Isaiah 44

1. Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant, and Israel whom I have chosen;

2. So says the LORD who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you; Fear not, O Jacob My servant, and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

3. For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground. I will pour My spirit on your seed, and My blessing on your offspring;

4. and they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water-courses.

5. One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, For the LORD, and be named by the name of Israel.

6. So says the LORD, the King of Israel, and His redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and besides Me there is no God.

7. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it and set it in order for Me, since I placed the people of old? And the things that are coming, and shall come, let them declares to them.

8. Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you and made you hear since then? So you are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Yea, there is none. I have not known a Rock.   

9. Those who make a graven image are all of them vanity; and the things in which they delight shall not help; and they are their own witnesses. They do not see nor know, that they may be ashamed.

10. Who has formed a god, or melted a graven image that is good for nothing?

11. Behold, all his companions shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen; they are from men. They shall assemble; all of them shall stand; they shall dread; they shall be ashamed together.

12. He engraves iron with a tool. He works in the coals, and forms it with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms. Then, he is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is weak.

13. He fashions wood, and stretches a line; he marks it out with a pencil; he shapes it with carving tools, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to sit in the house.

14. He cuts down cedars, and takes cypress and oak, which he makes the trees of the forest strong for him; he plants a tree, and the rain makes it grow.

15. And it shall be for a man to burn; for he will take some of it and warm himself. Yes, he kindles it and bakes bread; yes, he makes a god and worships; he makes it a graven image and falls down to it.

16. He burns part of it in the fire; with part of it he eats flesh; he roasts roast and is satisfied; yea, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.

17. And the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image; he falls down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me! for you are my god.

18. They have not known nor understood; for He has shut their eyes so that they cannot see; and their hearts so that they cannot understand.

19. And none thinks within his heart, nor is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread on the coals of it; I have roasted flesh and eaten; and shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?

20. He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside, so that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?   

21. Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are My servant; I have formed you; you are My servant; O Israel, you shall not be forgotten by Me.

22. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins; return to Me; for I have redeemed you.

23. Sing, O heavens; for the LORD has done it. Shout, lower parts of the earth. Break out into singing, O mountains, O forest, and every tree in it. For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified Himself in Israel.

24. So says the LORD, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb, I am the LORD who makes all things; who stretches out the heavens alone; who spreads out the earth; who was with Me?

25. who brings to nothing the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns the wise backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;

26. who makes the word of His servant sure, and makes good the counsel of His messengers; who says to Jerusalem, She shall have people; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places of it;

27. who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;

28. who says of Cyrus, He is My shepherd, and shall do all My pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.  

## Isaiah 45

1. So says the LORD to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have made strong in order to humble nations before him. And I will loosen the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut.

2. I will go before you, and make hills level. I will break in pieces the bronze gates, and cut the iron bars in two.

3. And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I am the LORD, who calls you by your name, the God of Israel.

4. For Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel My chosen, I have even called you by your name; I have named you, though you have not known me.   

5. I am the LORD, and there is none else, no God besides Me; I clothed you, though you have not known Me;

6. that they may know from the rising of the sun, and to the sunset, that there is none besides Me. I am the LORD, and there is none else;

7. forming the light and creating darkness; making peace and creating evil. I the LORD do all these things.

8. Drop down from above, O heavens, and let the clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, and let salvation bear fruit; and let righteousness spring up together. I the LORD have created it.'

9. Woe to him who fights with the One who formed him, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to its former, What are you making? Or your work, He has no hands?

10. Woe to him who says to his father, What are you fathering? Or to the woman, What are you laboring over?   

11. So says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and the One who formed him, Do you ask Me of things to come? Do you give command to Me about My sons, and about the work of My hands?

12. I have made the earth, and created man on it; I with My hands have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I commanded.

13. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall let My captives go, not for price nor reward, says the LORD of hosts.

14. So says the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come to you, and they shall be yours. They shall come after you in chains; and they shall cross in chains and they shall fall down to you. They shall plead to you, saying, Surely God is in you; and none else, no other God.

15. Truly You are a God who hides Yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

16. They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they who are makers of idols shall go into disgrace together.

17.  But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed nor blush to the forevers of eternity.

18. For so says the LORD the Creator of the heavens, He is God, forming the earth and making it; He makes it stand, not creating it empty, but forming it to be inhabited. I am the LORD, and there is no other.

19. I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain. I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.   

20. Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, escaped ones of the nations; those who set up the wood of their graven image, and those that pray to a god that cannot save. They know nothing.

21. Declare and bring near; yea, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this of old? Who has told it from then? Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God besides Me; a just God and a Savior; there is none besides Me.

22. Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.

23. I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

24. He says, Only in the LORD do I have righteousness and strength; even to Him he comes. And they are ashamed, all who are angry with Him.

25. In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.  

## Isaiah 46

1. Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle; the things you carried about have become a load, a burden for the weary.

2. They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves have gone into captivity.

3. Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who are borne by Me from the belly, who are lifted from the womb;

4.  even to old age I am He; and to gray hairs I will bear you. I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.   

5. To whom will you compare Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be alike?

6. They pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver out of the measuring rod, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it a god; they fall down, yea, they bow down.

7. They carry it on the shoulder, they carry it and set it in its place, and it stands; it shall not move from its place. Yes, one shall cry to it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

8. Remember this, and be a man; return it on your heart, O sinners.

9. Remember former things from forever; for I am God, and no other is God, even none like Me,

10. declaring the end from the beginning, and from the past things which were not done, saying, My purpose shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure;

11. calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country. Yes, I have spoken, I will also cause it to come; I have formed; yes, I will do it.

12. Listen to me, stubborn-hearted who are far from righteousness;

13. I bring near My righteousness. It shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Zion, My glory for Israel.  

## Isaiah 47

1. Come down, and sit on the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground. There is no throne for you, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.

2. Take the millstones and grind meal. Push back your veil, draw up your skirt, uncover your leg, pass over the rivers.

3. Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance and I will not meet you as a man.

4. Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel.

5. Sit silent, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.

6. I was angry with My people, I have polluted My inheritance, and given them into your hand. You showed them no mercy; you have very heavily laid your yoke on the aged.   

7. And you said, I shall be a mistress forever; so you did not lay these things to your heart, nor remembered the latter end of it.

8. Now then hear this, O pleasure seeker, who lives carelessly; who says in her heart, I am, and none else is; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children

9. But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come on you in their fullness for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great power of your enchantments.

10. For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you; and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else.

11. But evil shall come on you; you shall not know its origin. And mischief shall fall on you; you shall not be able to put it off. And desolation shall come on you suddenly, you shall not know.

12. Stand now with your spells, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have wearied yourself since your youth. Perhaps you will be able to profit; perhaps you may bring terror.

13. You are exhausted by your many plans; now let the astrologers, the stargazers, making known what is coming on you into the new moons.

14. Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; there shall not be a coal to warm them; nor fire, to sit before it.

15. So they are to you with whom you labored, your merchants from your youth. Each one wanders to his own way; none shall save you.  

## Isaiah 48

1. Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of the LORD and make mention of the God of Israel ( but not in truth nor in righteousness).

2. For they call themselves of the holy city, and rest themselves on the God of Israel; the LORD of hosts is His name.

3. I have foretold the former things from the beginning; and they went out of My mouth; and I made them hear; I acted suddenly; and they came about.

4. Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your brow bronze.

5. And I declared it to you from the beginning. Before it happened I revealed it to you; lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.

6. You heard; see it all; and will you not declare? I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.

7. They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you did not hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.

8. Yea, you did not hear; yea, you did not know; yea, from the time that your ear was not opened; for I surely know that you will betray and trespass; from the womb it was called to you.   

9. For My name's sake I will put off My anger, and for My praise I will hold back for you, that I do not cut you off.

10. Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.

11. For my sake, for My sake I will do it; for why should My name be defiled? And I will not give My glory to another.

12. Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, My called; I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.

13. My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens. I called; they stood up together.

14. Let all of you gather and hear; who among them has declared these things? The LORD has loved him; He will do His pleasure on Babylon, and His arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

15. I, I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I brought him and he makes his way succeed.   

16. Come near to me, hear this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. From its being, I was there; and now the Lord Jehovah, and His Spirit, has sent me.

17. So says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am the LORD your God who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.

18. Oh that you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

19. And your seed would have been like the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like its grain; his name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me.

20. Go out of Babylon; flee from the Chaldeans. Tell it with a voice of singing, let this be heard, let it go out to the end of the earth; say, The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob.

21. And they did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He cut open the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

22.  There is no peace, says the LORD, to the wicked.  

## Isaiah 49

1. Listen, O coastlands, to Me; and listen, lend your ear, peoples from afar; the LORD has called Me from the womb; He has made mention of My name from My mother's bowels.

2. And He has made My mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand He has hidden Me, and made Me a polished shaft. He has hidden Me in His quiver,

3. and said to Me, You are My servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.

4. Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have spent My strength for nothing, and in vain; yet surely My judgment is with the LORD, and My work with My God.

5. And now, says the LORD who formed Me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, Though Israel is not gathered, yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and My God shall be My strength.

6. And He said, It is but a little thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You for a light to the nations, to be My salvation to the end of the earth.   

7. So says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to Him whom man despises, to Him whom the nation hates, the servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, rulers also shall worship, because of the LORD who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, and He shall choose You.

8. So says the LORD, in a favorable time I replied to You, and in a day of salvation I have helped You; and I will preserve You, and give You for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause them to inherit the wasted inheritances;

9. that You may say to the prisoners, Go out! To those who are in darkness, Show yourselves! They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.

10. They shall not hunger nor thirst; nor shall the heat nor sun strike them; for He who has mercy on them shall lead them; even by the springs of water He shall guide them.

11. And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be set on high.

12. Behold, these shall come from far; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.   

13. Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break out into singing, O mountains; for the Lord has comforted His people, and will have mercy on His afflicted.

14. But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my LORD has forgotten me.

15. Can a woman forget her suckling child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget, yet I will not forget you.

16. Behold, I have carved you on the palms of My hands; your walls are forever before Me.

17. Your sons shall make haste; those destroying you and ruining you shall go out from you.   

18. Lift up your eyes all around and see; they all gather and come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall surely wear them as an ornament, and bind them on as a bride.

19. For your wastes and your deserted places, and your land of ruins, shall even now be too narrow to dwell there, and they who swallowed you up shall be far away.

20. The sons of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too narrow for me; come near to me so that I may dwell.

21. Then you shall say in your heart, Who has borne me these, since I am bereaved, and desolate, turned aside and an exile, and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?

22. So says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and have set up My banner to the people; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.

23. And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nurses. They shall bow to you, faces to the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD; by whom they shall not be ashamed who wait for Me.   

24. Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?

25. But so says the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the fearful ones shall escape. For I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your sons.

26. And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  

## Isaiah 50

1. So says the LORD, Where is your mother's bill of divorce, whom I have put away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you were sold for your iniquities, and your mother is put away for your sins.

2. Who knows why I have come, and no one is here? I called and no one answered. Is My hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.

3. I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.   

4. The Lord Jehovah has given Me the tongue of the learned, to know to help the weary with a word. He wakens morning by morning, He wakens the ear to hear as the learned.

5. The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backwards.

6. I gave My back to the strikers, and My cheeks to pluckers; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.

7. For the Lord Jehovah will help Me; therefore I have not been ashamed. On account of this I have set My face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

8.  He is near who justifies Me; who will contend with Me? Let us stand together; who is master of My judgment? Let him come near Me.

9. Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who is he who shall condemn Me? Lo, they all shall wear out like a garment; the moth shall eat them.   

10. Who among you fears the LORD, who obeys the voice of His servant, who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD and rest on his God.

11. Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who are surrounded with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks which you have kindled. This you shall have of My hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.  

## Isaiah 51

1. Listen to me, pursuers of righteousness; seekers of the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were cut, and to the hole of the pit from which you were dug.

2. Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

3. For the LORD shall comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places; and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness shall be found in it, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.   

4. Listen to Me, My people; and give ear to Me, O My nation; for a law shall go out from Me, and I will make My judgment to rest for a light of peoples.

5. My righteousness is near; My salvation has gone out, and My arms shall judge peoples; the coastlands shall wait on Me, and on My arm they shall trust.

6. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become old like a garment; and its inhabitants shall die in the same way. But My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be broken.

7. Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My law; do not fear the reproach of men, nor be afraid of their revelings.

8. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to generation.   

9. Awake! awake! Put on strength, O arm of the LORD. Awake! as in the days of old, in the generations of old. Was it not You who cut Rahab into pieces, piercing the sea-monster?

10. Was it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?

11. Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return and come with singing into Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head. Gladness and joy shall overtake them; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

12. I, I, am He who comforts you. Who are you, that you should fear a man. He shall die, or from the son of man? He shall be made as grass?

13. And you forget the LORD your Maker, who has stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. And you dread continually, every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy. And where is the fury of the oppressor?

14. Bowed he hurries to be freed, and not that he should die in the pit, nor that he lack his bread.

15. But I am the LORD your God, who divided the sea, and its waves roared; the LORD of hosts is His name.

16. And I have put My words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are My people.   

17. Awake! Awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem, who drank the cup of His fury from the hand of the LORD; you have drunk the cup of reeling to the dregs, and wrung them out.

18. No guide is for her among all the sons she has borne; and none takes her by the hand of all the sons that she made to grow.

19. These two things have come to you, who shall be sorry for you? Desolation, and ruin, and the famine, and the sword. By whom shall I comfort you?

20. Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the street like a wild antelope in a net, filled with the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.

21. So now hear this, afflicted one, and drunken, but not with wine.

22. So says your Lord Jehovah, and your God who strives for His people, Behold, I have taken the cup of reeling from your hand, even the dregs of the cup of My fury; you shall never drink it again.

23. But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, Bow down so that we may cross; and put your back as the ground, even as the street to those who cross.  

## Isaiah 52

1. Awake! Awake! Put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For never again shall come to you uncircumcised and unclean ones.

2. Shake yourself from the dust; rise up! Sit, Jerusalem! Free yourself from your neckbands, O captive daughter of Zion.

3. For so says the LORD, You were sold for nothing; and you shall not be redeemed with silver.

4. For so says the Lord Jehovah, My people went down before into Egypt to stay there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

5. Now therefore, what have I here, says the LORD, that My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule make them howl, says the LORD; and without ceasing My name is blasphemed every day.

6. Therefore My people shall know My name; So it shall be in that day, for I am He who speaks; behold, it is I.   

7. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good tidings, making peace heard; who brings good news, making salvation heard; who says to Zion, Your God reigns!

8. The voice of Your watchmen shall lift up! They lift up the voice together; they sing aloud. For they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.

9. Break out, sing together, waste places of Jerusalem; for the LORD has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.

10. The LORD has bared His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

11. Turn! Turn! Go out from there! Touch not the unclean. Go out of her midst; purify yourself, bearers of the vessels of the LORD.

12. For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel gathers you.   

13. Behold, My Servant shall rule well; He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.

14. Just as many were astonished at You (so much was the disfigurement from man, His appearance and His form from the sons of mankind);

15. so He sprinkles from many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for they will see that which was not told to them; yea, what they had not heard, nor understood.  

## Isaiah 53

1. Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?

2. For He comes up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; He has no form nor majesty that we should see Him, nor an appearance that we should desire Him.

3.  He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as it were a hiding of faces from Him, He being despised, and we esteemed Him not.   

4. Surely He has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

5. But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was on Him; and with His stripes we ourselves are healed.

6. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, each one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.

7. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted; yet He opened not His mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before its shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.

8. He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare His generation? For He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of My people He was stricken.

9. And He put His grave with the wicked, and with a rich one in His death; although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.   

10. Yet it pleased the LORD to crush Him; to grieve Him; that He should put forth His soul as a guilt-offering. He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the will of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.

11. He shall see the fruit of the travail of His soul. He shall be fully satisfied. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify for many; and He shall bear their iniquities.

12. Therefore I will divide to Him with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong; because He has poured out His soul to death; and He was counted among the transgressors; and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for transgressors.  

## Isaiah 54

1. Rejoice, O unfruitful one that never bore; break out a song and shout, you who never travailed. For more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married woman, says the LORD.

2. Make the place of your tent larger, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not spare, lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes;

3. for you shall break out on the right hand and on the left. And your seed shall inherit the nations, and people will inhabit ruined cities.

4. Do not fear; for you shall not be ashamed, nor shall you blush; for you shall not be put to shame; for you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.

5. For your Maker is your husband; the LORD of hosts is His name; and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called.   

6. For the LORD has called you as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when you were rejected, says your God.

7. For a little moment I have left you; but with great mercies I will gather you.

8. In a little wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on you, says the LORD your Redeemer.

9. For this is as the waters of Noah to Me; for as I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn from being angry with you and from rebuking you.

10. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall the covenant of My peace be removed, says the LORD who has mercy on you.   

11. Afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones among antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires.

12. And I will make your battlements of ruby, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders of pleasant stones.

13. And all your sons shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of your sons.

14. In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.

15. Behold, they shall surely gather together, not by Me; whoever shall gather against you, he shall fall by you.

16. Behold, I have created the smith who blows the coals in the fire, and who brings out a tool for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

17. No weapon that is formed against you shall be blessed; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is from Me, says the LORD.  

## Isaiah 55

1. Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat. Yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

2. Why do you weigh silver for what is not bread? and your labor for what never satisfies? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

3. Bow down your ear, and come to Me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.

4. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, a Leader and Commander of peoples.

5. Behold, You shall call a nation that You do not know; a nation that did not know You shall run to You because of the LORD Your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You.   

6. Seek the LORD while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.

7. Let the wicked forsake His way, and the unrighteous man His thoughts; and let him return to the LORD, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.

8. For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways My ways, says the LORD.

9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.

10. For as the rain comes down, and the snow from the heavens, and does not return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring out and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;

11. so shall My word be, which goes out of My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall certainly do what I sent it to do.

12. For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break out before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

13. Instead of the thorn, the fir tree shall come up; and instead of the brier, the myrtle tree shall come up; and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign which shall not be cut off.  

## Isaiah 56

1. So says the LORD, Keep judgment and do justice; for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.

2. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it; keeping the sabbath, from defiling it; and keeping his hand from doing any evil.   

3. And do not let the son of the stranger, who has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, the LORD has utterly separated me from His people. And do not let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

4. For so says the LORD to the eunuchs who keep My sabbath, and choose things that please Me, and take hold of My covenant;

5. even to them will I give within My house and within My walls a hand and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.

6. Also the sons of the stranger, who join themselves to the LORD to serve Him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be His servants, everyone who keeps from defiling the sabbath, and takes hold of My covenant;

7. even them I will bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples,

8. says the Lord Jehovah who gathers the outcasts of Israel, Yet I will gather beside him his gathered ones.   

9. All beasts of the field, come to devour, all beasts in the forest.

10. His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant; they are all dumb dogs who cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.

11. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough; and they are shepherds who cannot understand. They all look to their own way, every one for his gain, to his own end.

12.  They say, come, Let us take wine, and let us gulp strong drink; and tomorrow shall be like today, and much more abundant.  

## Isaiah 57

1. The righteous one perishes, and no one lays it to heart, and merciful men are taken away; no one cares that the righteous is taken away from the face of evil.

2. He shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.   

3. But draw near here, sons of the sorceress, seed of the adulterer and the harlot.

4. Of whom are you making sport? Against whom do you make a wide mouth and draw out the tongue? Are you not children of transgression, a lying seed,

5. being inflamed with idols under every green tree, killing the little sons in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?

6. Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion; they, even they, are your lot; even to them you have poured a drink offering, you have offered a food offering. Should I be consoled over these?

7. On a lofty and high mountain you have set your bed; even there you went up to offer sacrifice.

8. Also behind the door and the post you have set up your image; for you uncovered yourself and went up from Me. You spread your bed and cut a covenant with them; you loved their bed where you looked.

9. And you went to the king with ointment, and increased your perfumes, and sent your messengers far off, and lowered yourself even to hell.

10. You are wearied in the length of your way; you did not say, Despair! You found life in your hand; so you were not weak.

11. And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and have not remembered Me, nor laid it to your heart? Have I not been silent, even from forever, and you did not fear Me?

12. I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not do you any good.   

13. When you cry, let your gathering deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away. Vanity shall take them; but he who puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.

14. And He shall say, Raise up! Raise up! Clear the way! Make the stumbling-block rise out of the way of My people.

15. For so says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity; whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, even with the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

16. For I will not contend forever, nor will I be always angry; for the spirit should fail before Me, and the souls I have made.   

17. For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid Myself, and was angry, and he went on turning away in the way of his heart.

18. I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will also lead him, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.

19.  I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace, to him far off, and to him near, says the LORD; and I will heal him.

20. But the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.

21.  There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.  

## Isaiah 58

1. Cry aloud, do not spare, lift up your voice like a ram's horn, and show My people their rebellion, and the house of Jacob their sins.

2. Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and one who did not forget the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in drawing near to God.   

3.  They say, Why have we fasted, and You do not see? Why have we afflicted our soul, and You take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and crush all your laborers.

4. Behold, you fast for strife and debate, and to strike with the fist of wickedness; you shall not fast as you do today, to make your voice to be heard on high.

5. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and a day pleasing to the LORD?

6.  Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed ones go free, and that you break every yoke?

7.  Is it not to break your bread to the hungry, and that you should bring home the wandering poor? When will you see the naked and cover him; and you will not hide yourself from your own flesh?   

8. Then shall your light break out as the dawn, and your health shall spring out quickly; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall gather you.

9. Then you shall call, and the LORD shall answer; you shall cry, and He shall say, Here I am. If you take the yoke away from among you, the pointing of the finger, and speaking vanity;

10. and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light rise in darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday.

11. And the LORD shall always guide you and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones fat; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail not.

12. And those who come of you shall build the old ruins; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.   

13. If you turn your foot because of the Sabbath, from doing what you please on My holy days, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words,

14. then you shall delight yourself in the LORD; and I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed yourself with the inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.  

## Isaiah 59

1. Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened so that it cannot save, nor is His ear heavy so that it cannot hear.

2. But your iniquities have come between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, from hearing.

3. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness.

4. None calls for justice, nor does anyone plead for truth; they trust in vanity and speak lies. They conceive mischief and bring out iniquity.

5. They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; he who eats their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.

6. Their webs shall not become clothing, nor shall they cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

7. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and ruin are in their paths.

8. They did not know the way of peace, and there is no judgment in their paths. They have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them shall not know peace.   

9. Therefore judgment is far from us; nor does justice overtake us. We wait for light, but behold, dimness; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.

10. We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in deserted places like dead men.

11. We all roar like bears, and mourn grievously like doves; we look for judgment, but none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.

12. For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;

13. in transgressing and lying against the LORD, and going away from our God, talking cruelty and revolt, conceiving and speaking from the heart words of falsehood.

14. And justice is driven back, and justice stands afar off; for truth has fallen in the street, and right cannot enter.

15. Yea, truth fails; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And the LORD saw, and it displeased Him that there was no judgment.   

16. And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him; and His righteousness sustained Him.

17. For He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head. And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was covered with zeal like a cloak.

18. According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay; fury to His foes, deed for deed to His enemies. He will repay their deeds to the coastlands.

19. So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall make him flee.

20. And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says the LORD.

21. As for Me, this is My covenant with them, says the LORD; My spirit that is on you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, says the LORD, from now on and forever.  

## Isaiah 60

1. Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen on you.

2. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but the LORD shall rise on you, and His glory shall be seen on you.

3. And the nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawning.

4. Lift up your eyes all around, and see. All of them gather themselves; they come to you. Your sons shall come from far, and your daughters shall be nursed at your side.

5. Then you shall fear and become bright, and your heart shall throb and swell for joy; because the abundance of the sea shall turn to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you.

6. A host of camels shall cover you, the camels of Midian and Ephah. All of them from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall proclaim the praises of the LORD.

7. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you; the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you. They shall come up on My altar pleasing Me, and I will glorify the house of My glory.

8. Who are these who fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?   

9. Surely the coastlands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the LORD your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.

10. And the sons of strangers will build up your walls, and their kings will serve you; for in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor I had mercy on you.

11. Therefore your gates will always be open; they will not be shut day nor night, to bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings may be led.

12. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish. Yes, those nations will be completely wasted.

13. The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.

14. Also the sons of your afflicters shall come bowing to you; and all your despisers will bow down at the soles of your feet. And they will call you, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.   

15. Instead of being forsaken and hated, so that no one passes through, I will make you for everlasting majesty, a joy of many generations.

16. You will also suck the milk of nations, and suck the breast of kings; and you will know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

17. For bronze I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver; and for wood I will bring bronze, and for stones, iron. I will also make your overseers to be peace, and your rulers to be righteousness.

18. Violence will no more be heard in your land, wasting nor ruin within your borders; but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.

19. The sun will no more be your light by day; nor the brightness of the moon give light to you; but the LORD will be to you for everlasting light, and your God your glory.

20. Your sun will no more go down, nor your moon withdraw; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be ended.

21. Your people also will all be righteous; they will inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.

22. A little one will become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in its time.  

## Isaiah 61

1. The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is on Me; because the LORD has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;

2. to preach the acceptable year of the LORD and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;

3. to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; so that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He might be glorified.   

4. And they will build the old wastes, they will raise up the ruins of former times. And they will repair the waste cities, the ruins of many generations.

5. And strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the stranger will be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

6. But you will be named the priests of the LORD; it will be said of you, Ministers of our God; you will eat the riches of the nations, and you will revel in their glory.

7. For your shame you will have double; and for disgrace they will rejoice in their portion; therefore in their own land they will possess double; everlasting joy will be theirs.

8. For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

9. And their seed will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them will acknowledge them, that they are the seed the LORD has blessed.   

10. I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul will be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the robes of salvation, He covered me with the robe of righteousness like a bridegroom adorns himself with ornaments, and like a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

11. For as the earth comes out with its bud, and as the garden causes that which is sown to grow; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to grow before all the nations.  

## Isaiah 62

1. For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until its righteousness goes out as brightness, and her salvation as a burning lamp.

2. And the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; and you will be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD will name.

3. You also will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.

4. You will no more be called Forsaken; nor will your land any more be called Desolate; but you will be called My Delight, is in her, and your land, Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land will be married.

5. For as a young man marries a virgin, so will your sons marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so will your God rejoice over you.   

6. I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, who will not always be silent all the day nor all the night; you who remember the LORD, do not be silent.

7. And give Him no rest until He establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

8. The LORD has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength, Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies; and the sons of strangers will not drink your wine for which you have labored.

9. But its gatherers will eat it and praise the LORD; and they who collected it will drink it in My holy courts.   

10. Pass! Pass through the gates; prepare the way of the people. Raise up! Raise up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a banner for the peoples.

11. Behold, the LORD has sent a message to the end of the earth, Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.

12. And they will call them, The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called, Sought out, a city not forsaken.  

## Isaiah 63

1. Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, this One adorned in His clothing, bending down in His great power? I who speak in righteousness, great to save.

2. Why is Your clothing red, and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress?

3. I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with Me; for I will tread them in My anger and trample them in My fury; and their blood will be sprinkled on My garments, and I will stain all My clothing.

4. For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come.

5. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was no one to uphold; therefore My own arm has saved for Me; and My fury upheld Me.

6. And I will tread down the people in My anger, and make them drunk in My fury, and I will pour their juice to the earth.   

7. I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has benefited for us, and the great good to the house of Israel by which He benefited them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses.

8. For He said, Surely they are My people, sons that will not lie; so He was their Savior.

9. In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.

10. But they rebelled, and troubled His Holy Spirit; therefore He was turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.

11. Then He remembered the days of old, Moses and His people, saying, Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within him?

12. He led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make Himself an everlasting name?

13. He led them through the deep, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they would not stumble?

14. As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest. So You led Your people, to make Yourself a glorious name.   

15. Look down from Heaven, and look down from the place of Your holiness and of Your glory; where is Your zeal and Your strength, the multitude of Your tender affections and of Your mercies toward me? Are they withheld?

16. For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does acknowledge us. You, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.

17. O LORD, why have You made us wander from Your ways. You harden our heart from Your fear? For Your servants' sake, return the tribes of Your inheritance.

18. The people of Your holiness have possessed it but a little while; our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.

19. We are from forever; You never ruled over them; Your name was never called on them.  

## Isaiah 64

1. Oh that You would tear the heavens and come down, that mountains would quake before You,

2. ( as the brushwood fire burns, the fire causes water to boil), to make Your name known to Your foes, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!

3. When You did dreadful things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains flowed down at Your presence.

4. And from forever they have not heard, nor did they listen. Eye has not seen a God except You, who works for him who waits for Him.

5. You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned. In them is eternity, and we will be saved.   

6. But we are all as the unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth. And we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

7. And there is no one who calls on Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away because of our iniquities.

8. But now, O LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our Former; and we all are the work of Your hand.

9. Do not be grievously angry, O LORD, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold! Look, please; all of us are Your people.

10. Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a ruin.

11. The house of our holiness and our beauty, where our fathers praised You, has become a burning of fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

12. Will You restrain Yourself over these things, O LORD? Will You be silent and sorely afflict us?  

## Isaiah 65

1. I am sought by those who asked not for Me; I am found by those who did not seek Me. I said, Behold Me, behold Me, to a nation not calling on My name.

2. I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in the way not good, after their own thoughts;

3. a people who without ceasing provoke Me to anger to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on the bricks;

4.  a people who remain among the graves, and sleep in the tombs, who eat swine's flesh, and broth from hateful things in their vessels;

5. who say, Keep to yourself, do not come near me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.

6. Behold, it is written before Me; I will not be silent, except I will repay; yea, I will repay into their bosom

7. your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, they that burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills. And I will measure their former work into their bosom.   

8. So says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do to My servants, that I may not destroy them all.

9. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who inherits My mountains; and My elect will inherit it, and My servants will dwell there.

10. And Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting-place of herds for My people who have sought Me.   

11. But you are those who forsake the LORD, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who furnish the drink offering to Fate.

12. Therefore I will number you to the sword; and you will all bow down to the slaughter; because I called and you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear and did evil before My eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.

13. So the Lord Jehovah says, Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be ashamed.

14. Behold,. My servants will sing for joy of heart, but you will cry for sorrow of heart, and will howl because of a breaking of spirit.

15. And you will leave your name for a curse to My chosen; for the Lord Jehovah will kill you, and call His servants by another name.

16.  He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from My eyes.   

17. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the things before will not be remembered, nor come to mind.

18. But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

19. I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and I will rejoice in My people; and the voice of weeping will no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying be heard in her.

20. There will not be an infant, nor an old man that has not filled his days. For the child will die a hundred years old; but the sinner who is a hundred years old will be despised.

21. And they will build houses and live in them; and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

22. They will not build, and another live in them; they will not plant, and another eat. For like the days of a tree are the days of My people, and My elect will long enjoy the work of their hands.

23. They will not labor in vain, nor bring forth for terror. For they are the seed of the beloved of the LORD, and their offspring with them.

24. And it will be, before they call I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.

25. The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the food of the snake. They will not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says the LORD.  

## Isaiah 66

1. So says the LORD, Heaven is My throne, and earth My footstool. Where, then, is the house that you build for Me? And where is the place of My rest?

2. For all those My hand has made, and all those exist, says the LORD. But to this one I will look, to the afflicted and contrite spirit, and the one who trembles at My word.

3. He who kills an ox is is as if he killed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dog's neck; he who offers an offering is as if he offered swine's blood; he who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.

4. I also will choose the things that delude them, and I will bring their fears on them, because I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not hear. But they did evil before My eyes and chose that in which I did not delight.   

5. Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at His word; your brothers who hated you, who cast you out for My name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified. But He will appear to your joy, and they will be ashamed.

6. A sound of noise from the city, a sound from the temple, a sound of the LORD repaying His enemies.

7. Before she travailed, she gave birth; before her pain came, she delivered a man child.

8. Who has heard a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Will the earth be brought forth in one day? Or will a nation be born at once? For Zion travailed and also brought forth her sons.

9. Will I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, says the LORD? Surely I will cause birth and restrain, says your God.

10. Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all who mourn for her;

11. that you may suck and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may milk out and be delighted with the fullness of her glory.

12. For so says the LORD, Behold, I will hold out peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like a flowing stream. Then you will suck, you will be carried on her sides and be dandled upon her knees.

13. As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.

14. And you will see, and your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like the grass. And the hand of the LORD will be known toward His servants, and His fury toward His enemies.   

15. For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with His chariots like a tempest, to refresh His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.

16. For by fire and by His sword the LORD will execute judgment with all flesh; and the slain of the LORD will be many.

17. Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to go into the gardens, behind one tree in the middle, eating swine's flesh, and the hateful thing, and the mouse, will be cut off together, says the LORD.

18. For I know their works and their thoughts; it comes to gather all the nations and the tongues; and they will come and see My glory.

19. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape from them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawers of the bow; to Tubal, and Javan, to the far away coasts that have not heard My fame, nor have seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations.

20. And they will bring all your brothers for an offering to the LORD out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, as the sons of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.

21. And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.

22. For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make stand before Me, says the LORD, so will your seed and your name stand.

23. And it will be, from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before Me, says the LORD.

24. And they will go out and see the dead bodies of the men who have sinned against Me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be put out; and they will be an object of disgust to all flesh.
