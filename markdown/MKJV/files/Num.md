2. Command the sons of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper and everyone that has an issue, and whoever is defiled by a dead body.

3. You shall put out both male and female. You shall put them outside the camp so that they do not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.

4. And the sons of Israel did so, and put them out outside the camp. Even as the LORD spoke to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.

5. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Speak to the sons of Israel: When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the LORD, and that person is guilty,

7. then they shall confess their sin which they have done. And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it one fifth of it, and give it to him against whom he has sinned.

8. But if the man has no kinsman to whom he may make restitution for the guilt, the guilt which is restored shall be given to the LORD, to the priest, besides the ram of the atonement by which an atonement shall be made for him.

9. And every offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel which they shall bring to the priest, shall be his.

10. And every man's devoted things shall be his. Whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.   

11. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

12. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, If any man's wife goes astray, and has committed a trespass against him,

13. and a man lie with her carnally, and if it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and is kept hidden, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her, neither is she taken in the act;

14. and if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled-- or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he is jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled--

15. then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. And he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is an offering of jealousy, a reminding offering, bringing iniquity to mind.

16. And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORD.

17. And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel. And the priest shall take of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.

18. And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the reminding offering in her hands, which is the jealousy offering. And the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse.

19. And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, you are free from this bitter water that causes the curse.

20. But if you have gone aside, being under your husband, and if you are defiled and some man besides your husband has given his semen to you,

21. then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing. And the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD makes your thigh to fall away and your belly to swell.

22. And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels to make your belly swell and your thigh fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

23. And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water.

24. And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse. And the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.

25. Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar.

26. And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as a memorial of it, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward he shall cause the woman to drink the water.

27. And when he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she is defiled and has committed a trespass against to her husband, the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter. And her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away. And the woman shall be a curse among her people.

28. And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean, then she shall be clean, and shall conceive seed.

29. This is the law of jealousies when a woman goes aside, being under her husband, and is defiled.

30. Or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

31. Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and the woman shall bear her iniquity.  

## Numbers 6

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man or woman shall separate in order to vow a vow of a Nazarite, in order to separate to the LORD,

3. he shall separate from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink; neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes or dried.

4. All the days of his Nazariteship he shall eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

5. All the days of his vow to separate, no razor shall come upon his head. Until all the days are fulfilled in which he separates to the LORD, he shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

6. All the days that he separates to the LORD, he shall not come near any dead body.

7. He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to his God is upon his head.

8. All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.

9. And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day he shall shave it.

10. And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

11. And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, because he sinned by the dead, and shall make his head holy that same day.

12. And he shall set apart to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a guilt offering. But the former days shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.

13. And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled. He shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

14. And he shall offer his offering to the LORD: one male lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

15. and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour, cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their food offerings and their drink offerings.

16. And the priest shall bring them before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.

17. And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also his food offering and his drink offering.

18. And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

19. And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazarite, after his separation has been shaved.

20. And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. This is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder. And afterward the Nazarite may drink wine.

21. This is the law of the Nazarite who has vowed his offering to the LORD for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to the vow which he vowed, so he must do according to the law of his separation.   

22. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to Aaron and to his sons saying, In this way you shall bless the sons of Israel, saying to them,

24. The LORD bless you and keep you.

25. The LORD make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.

26. The LORD lift up His face to you and give you peace.

27. And they shall put My name upon the sons of Israel. And I, I will bless them.

## Numbers 8

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and say to him, When you bring the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.

3. And Aaron did so. He lighted its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses.

4. And this work of the lampstand was of beaten gold, to its base and to its blossoms; it was beaten work. According to the pattern which the LORD had showed Moses, so he made the lampstand.   

5. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

6. Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and purify them.

7. And in this way shall you do to them to purify them. Sprinkle water of sin-offering on them, and let them shave all their flesh and wash their clothes, and make themselves clean.

8. Then let them take a young bull with its food offering, fine flour mixed with oil, and another young bull shall you take for a sin offering.

9. And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation. And you shall gather the whole assembly of the sons of Israel together.

10. And you shall bring the Levites before the LORD. And the sons of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites.

11. And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the sons of Israel, so that they may do the service of the LORD.

12. And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls. And you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, to the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.

13. And you shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering to the LORD.

14. So you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel. And the Levites shall be Mine.

15. And after that the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. And you shall purify them and offer them for a wave offering.

16. For they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel, instead of those that open every womb. The first-born of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them to Me.

17. For all the first-born of the sons of Israel are Mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt I set them apart for Myself.

18. And I have taken the Levites for all the first-born of the sons of Israel.

19. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the sons of Israel, so that there may be no plague among the sons of Israel when the sons of Israel come near the sanctuary.

20. And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites according to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites. So the sons of Israel did to them.

21. And the Levites purified themselves, and they washed their clothes. And Aaron offered them, an offering before the LORD. And Aaron made an atonement for them to purify them.

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

24. This is that which pertains to the Levites. From twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

25. And from the age of fifty years they shall stop waiting upon the service, and shall serve no more.

26. But they shall minister with their brothers in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge; only he shall not serve at a service. So you shall do to the Levites as to their duties.  

## Numbers 9

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

2. Let the sons of Israel also keep the Passover at its appointed time.

3. In the fourteenth day of this month, between the evenings, you shall keep it in its appointed time. You shall keep it according to all its statutes, and according to all the ceremonies of it.

4. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel to prepare the Passover.

5. And they prepared the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so all the sons of Israel did.

6. And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man, so that they could not prepare the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.

7. And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in its appointed time among the sons of Israel?

8. And Moses said to them, You wait, and I will hear what the LORD will command about you.

9. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean because of a dead body, or in a journey afar off, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD.

11. They shall keep it the fourteenth day of the second month at evening, eating it with unleavened cakes and bitter herbs.

12. They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any bone of it. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it.

13. But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and holds back from preparing the Passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people. Because he did not bring the offering of the LORD in His appointed time, that man shall bear his sin.

14. And if a stranger shall live among you, and prepares the Passover to the LORD, he shall do according to the ordinance of the Passover, and according to its ordinance. You shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land.   

15. And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was upon the tabernacle, looking like fire, until the morning.

16. So it was always. The cloud covered it, and it looked like fire by night.

17. And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the sons of Israel pulled up stakes. And in the place where the cloud stayed, there the sons of Israel pitched their tents.

18. At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel pulled up stakes, and at the command of the LORD they pitched. As long as the cloud stayed upon the tabernacle they rested in camp.

19. And when the cloud stayed long upon the tabernacle many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and did not journey.

20. And so when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle, according to the command of the LORD they remained in their tents, and according to the command of the LORD they pulled up stakes.

21. And so when the cloud stayed from evening to the morning, and the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they pulled up stakes. Whether by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they pulled up stakes.

22. Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud stayed upon the tabernacle, remaining on it, the sons of Israel stayed in their tents and did not journey. But when it was taken up, they pulled up stakes.

23. At the command of the LORD they encamped, and at the command of the LORD they pulled up stakes. They kept the charge of the LORD at the command of the LORD by the hand of Moses.  

## Numbers 10

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Make two trumpets of silver for yourself. You shall make them of beaten work. And they shall be used for the calling of the assembly and for causing the camps to go forward.

3. And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall gather themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

4. And if they blow with one, then the rulers who are heads of the thousands of Israel shall gather themselves to you.

5. When you blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall pull up.

6. When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall pull up. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

7. But when the congregation is to be gathered, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.

8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets. And they shall be to you for an ordinance forever throughout your generations.

9. And if you go to war in your land against the enemy who fights against you, then you shall blow with the trumpets. And you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.

10. Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, so that they may be to you for a memorial before your GOD. I am the LORD your God.   

11. And on the twentieth of the second month, in the second year, the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the testimony.

12. And the sons of Israel pulled up in their journeyings out of the wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

27. And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.

28. These were the journeyings of the sons of Israel according to their armies when they pulled up.   

29. And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law: We are going to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will do you good. For the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.

30. And he said to him, I will not go, but I will go to my own land and to my kindred.

31. And he said, Please do not leave us, because you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and so you may be to us for eyes.

32. And it shall be, if you go with us, then it shall be, whatever goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to you.

33. And they moved three days' journey from the mountain of the LORD. And the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to look for a resting-place for them.

34. And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they pulled up out of the camp.

35. And it happened when the ark pulled up, Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You.

36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.  

## Numbers 11

1. And the people were evil, as those complaining in the ears of the LORD. And the LORD heard, and His anger was kindled. And the fire of the LORD burned among them and burned up in the outermost parts of the camp.

2. And the people cried to Moses. And when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was put out.

3. And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.   

4. And the mixed multitude in their midst lusted with great lust. And the sons of Israel also turned and wept, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?

5. We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.

6. But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes.

7. And the manna was like coriander seed, and the color of it was like the color of bdellium.

8. The people went around and gathered, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked in pans, and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of fresh oil.

9. And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.

10. Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly. Moses also was displeased.

11. And Moses said to the LORD, Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, so that You lay the burden of all this people upon me?

12. Have I conceived all this people? Did I bring them forth, that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom like a nursing father carries the sucking child, to the land which You swore to their fathers?

13. From where should I get flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat.

14. I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.

15. And if You are going to part this way with me, I beg You to kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and let me not see my misery.   

16. And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and the officers over them. And bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation so that they may stand there with you.

17. And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take of the spirit on you, and will put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you do not bear it yourself alone.

18. And say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh. For you have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat, for it was well with us in Egypt? Therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.

19. You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days.

20. Even a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is hateful to you, because you have despised the LORD among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we come out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen. And You have said, I will give them flesh so that they may eat a whole month!

22. Shall the flocks and the herds be killed for them, to be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?

23. And the LORD said to Moses, Has the LORD's hand become short? You shall see now whether or not My word shall come to pass to you.   

24. And Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them all around the tabernacle.

25. And the LORD came down in a cloud and spoke to him, and took of the spirit on him and gave it to the seventy elders. And it happened when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they never did so again.

26. But two of the men stayed in the camp; the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other was Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. And they were of those who were written, but did not go out to the tabernacle. And they prophesied in the camp.

27. And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.

28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, make them cease.

29. And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!

30. And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.   

31. And a wind went forth from the LORD. And it cut off quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits  high upon the face of the earth.

32. And the people stood up all that day and all night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. And he that gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.

33. And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague.

34. And he called the name of that place Graves of Lust, because there they buried the people that lusted.

35.  And the people pulled up from the Graves of Lust to Hazeroth, and stayed at Hazeroth.  

## Numbers 12

1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken. For he had taken a Cushite woman.

2. And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? Has He not also spoken by us? And the LORD heard.

3. (Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all the men on the face of the earth.)   

4. And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, You three come out to the tabernacle of the congregation. And the three came out.

5. And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both came forth.

6. And He said, Hear now My words. If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD will make Myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.

7. Not so, My servant Moses. He is faithful in all My house.

8. I will speak with him mouth to mouth, even clearly, and not in dark speeches. And he shall behold the likeness of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?

9. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and He moved.   

10. And the cloud moved from the tabernacle. And behold! Miriam became leprous, as snow. And Aaron looked on Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.

11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not lay upon us the sin in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.

12. Let her not be like one dead, of whom the flesh is half gone when he comes out of his mother's womb.

13. And Moses cried to the LORD saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech You.

14. And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received.

15. And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days. And the people did not pull up until Miriam was brought in.

16. And afterward the people moved from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.  

## Numbers 13

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Send men so that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel. You shall send a man from every tribe of their fathers, everyone a ruler among them.

3. And Moses by the command of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran. All those men were heads of the sons of Israel.

4. And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

5. Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

6. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

7. Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

8. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

9. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

10. Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

11. Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

12. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

13. Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

14. Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

15. Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

16. These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Joshua.

17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way, southward, and go up into the mountain.

18. And see the land, what it is, and the people that live in it, whether it is strong or weak, few or many.

19. And see what the land is that they live in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds;

20. and what the land is, whether fat or lean, whether there is wood in it or not. And be of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of first ripe grapes.   

21. So they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

22. And they went up by the south and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

23. And they came to the valley of Eshcol and cut from there a branch with one cluster of grapes. And they carried it between two men upon a staff, and some of the pomegranates and of the figs.

24. The place was called the valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut down from there.

25. And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.   

26. And they left and came to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh. And they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

27. And they told him and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey. And this is the fruit of it.

28. However, the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are walled, very great. And also we saw the children of Anak there.

29. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan.

30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, Let us go up at once and possess it. For we are well able to overcome it.

31. But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.

32. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the sons of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up those who live in it. And all the people whom we saw in it were men of stature.

33. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, of the giants. And we were in our own sight like grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.  

## Numbers 14

1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried. And the people wept that night.

2. And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. And the whole congregation said to them, Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or, Oh that we had died in the wilderness!

3. And why has the LORD brought us into this land to fall by the sword, so that our wives and our sons should be a prey? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?

4. And they said to one another, Let us make a leader, and let us return to Egypt.   

5. And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.

6. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those that searched the land, tore their clothes.

7. And they spoke to all the company of the sons of Israel saying, The land which we passed through to search is an exceedingly good land.

8. If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey.

9. Only do not rebel against the LORD, neither fear the people of the land. For they are bread for us. Their protection has moved from them, and the LORD is with us. Do not fear them.

10. But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the sons of Israel.   

11. And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke Me? And how long will it be before they believe Me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?

12. I will strike them with the pestilence and will disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.

13. And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear, for You have brought up this people in Your might from among them.

14. And they will say to the inhabitant of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, are among this people, who is seen eye to eye. You are the LORD, and Your cloud stands over them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.

15. And will you kill this people as one man? Then the nations who have heard Your fame will speak, saying,

16. Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, therefore He has slain them in the wilderness.

17. And now, I beseech You, let the power of my Lord be great, according as You have spoken, saying,

18. The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation.

19. I beseech You, pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your mercy, and as You have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.   

20. And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to your word.

21. But truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.

22. Because all those men who have seen My glory and My miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted Me now these ten times, and have not listened to My voice,

23. surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked Me see it.

24. But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed Me fully, I will bring him into the land into which he went. And his seed shall possess it.

25. (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites lived in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.

26. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

27. How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmurs against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they murmur against Me.

28. Say to them, As I live, says the LORD, as you have spoken in My ears, so I will do to you.

29. Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me,

30. you shall certainly not come into the land which I swore to make you live in, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

31. But your little ones, which you said should be a prey, I will bring them in and they shall know the land which you have despised.

32. But as for you, your bodies shall fall in this wilderness.

33. And your sons shall feed in the wilderness forty years and bear your fornications, until your dead bodies have wasted in the wilderness.

34. According to the number of the days in which you searched the land-- forty days-- each day for a year you shall bear your iniquities, forty years; and you shall know my alienation.

35. I the LORD have spoken; I will surely do it to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. They shall be destroyed in this wilderness, and there they shall die.   

36. And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report upon the land,

37. even those men that brought up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the LORD.

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of the men that went to spy out the land, lived.

39. And Moses told these sayings to all the sons of Israel. And the people mourned greatly.

40. And they rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised, for we have sinned.

41. And Moses said, Why do you now go beyond the command of the LORD, since it shall not be blessed?

42. Do not go up, for the LORD is not among you. And shall you not be beaten before your enemies?

43. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

44. But they presumed to go up to the hill top. But the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, did not leave the camp.

45. And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who were living in that mountain came down and struck them, and beat them down, to Hormah.  

## Numbers 15

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you have come into the land of your dwelling places, which I give to you,

3. and will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a free-will offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor to the LORD, from the herd or from the flock,

4. then he who offers his offering to the LORD shall bring a food offering of a tenth part of flour mixed with the fourth of a hin of oil.

5. And the fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering shall you prepare with the burnt offering, or sacrifice, for one lamb.

6. Or for a ram, you shall prepare a food offering, two-tenth parts of flour mixed with the third of a hin of oil.

7. And for a drink offering you shall offer the third of a hin of wine for a sweet savor to the LORD.

8. And when you prepare a bull, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings to the LORD,

9. then he shall bring with the bull, a food offering of three-tenth parts of flour mixed with half a hin of oil.

10. And you shall bring for a drink offering half a hin of wine, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.

11. So it shall be done for one bull, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.

12. According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.

13. All that are born of the country shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.

14. And if a stranger stays with you, or whoever is among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savor to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.

15. One ordinance for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that resides with you, an ordinance forever in your generations. As you are, so the stranger shall be before the LORD.

16. One law and one way shall be for you and for the stranger that lives with you.

17. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

18. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land where I bring you,

19. then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a heave offering to the LORD.

20. You shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough, a heave offering, as the heave offering of the threshing-floor, so you shall lift it up.

21. Of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD a heave offering in your generations.   

22. And if you have erred and have not done all these commandments which the LORD has spoken to Moses,

23. all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that the LORD commanded, and onward in your generations,

24. then it shall be if it is committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, all the congregation shall offer up one young bull for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor to the LORD, with its food offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

25. And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it is ignorance. And they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance.

26. And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the sons of Israel and the stranger that lives among them, since all the people were in ignorance.

27. And if one soul sins through ignorance, then he shall bring a female goat of the first year for a sin offering.

28. And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul, when he sins through error before the LORD, to make an atonement for him. And it shall be forgiven him.

29. And you shall have one law for him who acts through ignorance; for him that is native among the sons of Israel and for the alien that resides among them.   

30. But the soul who acts with a high hand, whether of the native or of the alien, the same blasphemes the LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

31. Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall be upon him.

32. And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day.

33. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation.

34. And they put him under guard because it had not been clearly said what should be done to him.

35. And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.

36. And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died, even as the LORD commanded Moses.   

37. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

38. Speak to the sons of Israel and command them that they make fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue.

39. And it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look upon it and remember all the commands of the LORD, and do them; and so that you do not seek after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you prostitute yourself,

40. that you may remember and do all My commands, and be holy to your God.

41. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am the LORD your God.  

## Numbers 16

1. Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, took both Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben;

2. even they rose up before Moses with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty rulers of the assembly, elect men in the congregation, men who were well-known.

3. And they gathered themselves against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much upon you, since all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you lift yourselves up above the congregation of the LORD?

4. And Moses heard and fell on his face.

5. And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the LORD will show who are His, and him who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him; even him whom He has chosen, He will cause to come near to Him.

6. Do this. Take fire-pans, Korah and all his company,

7. and put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD tomorrow. And it shall be the man whom the LORD chooses, he shall be holy. You take too much upon you, sons of Levi!

8. And Moses said to Korah, Hear now you sons of Levi;

9.  is it only a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?

10. And He has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you. And do you seek the priesthood also?

11. For this cause you and all your company are gathered against the LORD. And what is Aaron, that you murmur against him?   

12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. And they said, We will not come up.

13.  Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but must you also seize dominion over us?

14. Besides, you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance in fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.

15. And Moses was very angry, and said to the LORD, Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.

16. And Moses said to Korah, Stand before the LORD, you and all your company-- you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.

17. And every man take his fire-pan and put incense in them, and let every man bring his fire-pan before the LORD, two hundred and fifty fire-pans, you also, and Aaron, each with his fire-pan.

18. And every man took his fire-pan and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah gathered all the congregation against them, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.

20. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, so that I may devour them in a moment.

22. And they fell upon their faces and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin and will You be angry with all the congregation?   

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

24. Speak to the congregation saying, Get away from the tent of Korah and Dathan and Abiram.

25. And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram. And the elders of Israel followed him.

26. And he spoke to the congregation, saying, I pray you, get away from the tents of these wicked men. And touch nothing of theirs lest you be destroyed in all their sins.

27. So they got away from the tent of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little sons.

28. And Moses said, By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, and that not from my own heart.

29. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they are visited according to the examination of all men, the LORD has not sent me.

30. But if the LORD makes a new thing, and the earth opens her mouth and swallows them up with all that they have, and they go down alive into the pit, then you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.

31. And it happened, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, the ground under them split apart.

32. And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who were for Korah, and all their goods.

33. They and all that they had went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed upon them. And they perished from among the congregation.

34. And all Israel around them fled at their cry. For they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.   

35. And there came out a fire from the LORD and burned up the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense.

36. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

37. Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder. For they are holy.

38. The fire-pans of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them into broad plates, a covering for the altar; for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are made holy. And they shall be a sign to the sons of Israel.

39. And Eleazar the priest took the bronze fire-pans, the ones with which those who had been burned up had offered, and they were made into broad plates, a covering of the altar,

40. a memorial to the sons of Israel, that no stranger not of the seed of Aaron may come near to offer incense before the LORD, so that he may not be as Korah and as his company-- as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.   

41. But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying, You have killed the people of the LORD.

42. And it happened when the congregation was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation. And behold! The cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

43. And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

44. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

45. Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take a fire-pan, and put fire in it from the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation and make an atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the LORD. The plague has begun.

47. And Aaron did as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation. And behold! The plague had begun among the people. And he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

48. And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stayed.

49. And those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand, seven hundred, besides the ones who died about the matter of Korah.

50. And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the plague was stayed.  

## Numbers 17

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and take a rod from each of them for a father's house, of all their rulers, for their fathers' house, twelve rods. Write every man's name upon his rod.

3. And you shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. For one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

4. And you shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

5. And it shall be, the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall blossom. And I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the sons of Israel by which they murmur against you.

6. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their rulers gave to him a rod, for each ruler, one rod for each ruler, for their father's house, twelve rods. And the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

7. And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.   

8. And it happened on the next day Moses went into the tabernacle of witness. And behold! The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded and had brought forth buds, and had bloomed blossoms, and had yielded almonds.

9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the sons of Israel. And they looked, and each one took his rod.

10. And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept as a token against the rebels. And you shall completely take away their murmurings from Me so that they do not die.

11. And Moses did as the LORD commanded him, so he did.

12. And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.

13. Whoever comes near the tabernacle of the LORD shall die. Shall we be consumed to die?  

## Numbers 18

1. And the LORD said to Aaron, You and your sons, and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. And you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

2. And bring your brothers also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father with you, so that they may be joined to you and minister to you, you and your sons with you, before the tabernacle of witness.

3. And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tabernacle. Only they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, so that neither they nor you also may die.

4. And they shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle. And a stranger shall not come near you.

5. And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, so that there may be no wrath any more upon the sons of Israel.

6. And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel. They are given to you as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

7. Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priests' office for everything of the altar and inside the veil. And you shall serve. I have given your priest's office as a service of gift. And the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.   

8. And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I have also given you the charge of My heave offerings of all the holy things of the sons of Israel. I have given them to you for the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance forever.

9. This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire, every sacrifice of theirs, every food offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall give Me. These are most holy for you and for your sons.

10. You shall eat it in the Holy of Holies. Every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.

11. And this is yours, the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel. I have given them to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute forever. Everyone that is clean in your house shall eat it.

12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, I have given them to you.

13. The first fruits of all that is in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours. Everyone that is clean in your house shall eat of it.

14. Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.

15. Everything that opens the womb in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, of men or animals, shall be yours. Nevertheless, the first-born of man you shall surely redeem, and the first-born of unclean animals you shall redeem.

16. And those that are to be redeemed from a month old you shall redeem, according to your judgment for the silver of five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.

17. But the first-born of a cow, or the first-born of a sheep, or the first-born of a goat, you shall not redeem. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat, an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to the LORD.

18. And their flesh shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.

19. All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the sons of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given you and your sons and your daughters with you, by a law forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.   

20. And the LORD said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them. I am your part and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.

21. And behold, I have given the sons of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

22. Neither must the sons of Israel come near the tabernacle of the congregation from now on, lest they bear sin and die.

23. But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity, a statute forever throughout your generations, that among the sons of Israel they have no inheritance.

24. But the tithes of the sons of Israel, which they offer as a heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit. Therefore I have said to them, Among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

25. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

26. And you shall speak to the Levites, and you shall say to them, When you take tithes from the sons of Israel, which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering of it for the LORD, a tenth of the tithe.

27. And your heave offering shall be credited to you as grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the winepress.

28. So you also shall offer a heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes which you receive from the sons of Israel. And you shall give from it the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.

29. Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all its fat, the holy part of it out of it.

30. And you shall say to them, When you have lifted up its fat, then it shall be credited to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the winepress.

31. And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households. For it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.

32. And you shall bear no sin because of it, when you have lifted up the fat of it. Neither shall you defile the holy things of the sons of Israel, lest you die.  

## Numbers 19

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron saying,

2. This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring you a red heifer, a perfect one, in which there is no blemish, on which no yoke ever came.

3. And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth outside the camp. And he shall kill her before his face.

4. And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times.

5. And he shall burn the heifer in his sight, her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung, he shall burn.

6. And the priest shall take cedar-wood and hyssop and scarlet, and throw it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water. And afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.

8. And he who burns her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.

9. And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay up outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water of separation. It is a cleansing for sin.

10. And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger that lives among them, for a statute forever.   

11. He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.

12. He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean. But if he does not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

13. Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is still upon him.

14. This is the law when a man dies in a tent. All that come into the tent, and all in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

15. And every open vessel which has no covering bound upon it, it is unclean.

16. And whoever touches one that is killed with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

17. And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of cleansing for sin, and running water shall be put to it in a vessel.

18. And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip in the water, and sprinkle upon the tent and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one killed, or one dead, or a grave.

19. And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day. And on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water. And he shall be clean at evening.

20. But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of separation has not been sprinkled upon him. He  is unclean.

21. And it shall be a perpetual law to them, that he who sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes. And he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until evening.

22. And whatever the unclean touches shall be unclean. And the soul who touches shall be unclean until evening.  

## Numbers 20

1. Then the sons of Israel came, the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month. And the people stayed in Kadesh. And Miriam died there and was buried there.

2. And there was no water for the congregation. And they gathered themselves against Moses and against Aaron.

3. And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying, Oh that we had died when our brothers died before the LORD!

4. And why have you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, so that we and our cattle should die there?

5. And why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us into this evil place? It is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates. And there is no water to drink.

6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to them.

7. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

8. Take the rod, and gather the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes. And it shall give forth its water, and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock. So you shall give the congregation and their animals drink.

9. And Moses took the rod from before the LORD as He commanded him.

10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now you rebels. Must we bring water for you out of this rock?

11. And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he struck the rock twice. And the water came out plentifully, and the congregation and their animals drank.

12. And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.

13. These are the Waters of Strife, because the sons of Israel fought with the LORD, and He showed Himself holy among them.   

14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, so says your brother Israel, You know all the trouble that has happened to us,

15. how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians troubled us and our fathers.

16. And when we cried to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an Angel, and has brought us forth out of Egypt. And behold! We are in Kadesh, a city in the outermost part of your border.

17. Let us pass, I pray you, through your country. We will not pass through a field, nor through a vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of a well. We will go by the king's highway. We will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed your borders.

18. And Edom said to him, You shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you with the sword.

19. And the sons of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway. And if I and my cattle drink of your water, then I will pay for it. Without doing anything, I will only go through on my feet.

20. And he said, You shall not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.

21. So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border. Therefore Israel turned away from him.   

22. And the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, pulled up from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,

24. Aaron shall be gathered to his people. For he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the Waters of Strife.

25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor.

26. And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son. And Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.

27. And Moses did as the LORD commanded. And they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there in the top of the mount. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

29. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, all the house of Israel.  

## Numbers 21

1. And king Arad the Canaanite, who lived in the south, heard that Israel came by the Way of the Spies, then he fought against Israel and took prisoners of them.

2. And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD and said, If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will completely destroy their cities.

3. And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites. And they completely destroyed them and their cities. And he called the name of the place Hormah.   

4. And they pulled up from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was very discouraged because of the way.

5. And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, neither is there any water. And our soul hates this light bread.

6. And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And many people of Israel died.

7. And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD that He take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

8. And the LORD said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole. And it shall be when everyone that is bitten, when he looks upon it, he shall live.

9. And Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole. And it happened that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked upon the serpent of brass, he lived.   

10. And the sons of Israel pulled up and pitched in Oboth.

11. And they pulled up from Oboth and pitched at Ije-abarim in the wilderness before Moab, toward the sunrising.

12. From there they pulled up and pitched in the valley of Zered.

13. From there they pulled up and pitched on the other side of Arnon, in the wilderness that comes out of the borders of the Amorites; for Arnon is in the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

14. Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, Waheb in Suphah, and in the torrents of Arnon,

15. and at the stream of the torrents that goes down to the dwelling of Ar and lies upon the border of Moab.

16. And from there they went to Beer. That is the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

17. Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well. Sing to it.

18. The well which the rulers dug, which the nobles of the people dug with their staves by the word of the Lawgiver. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,

19. and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,

20. and from Bamoth in the valley, in the country of Moab, they worked to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward the wilderness.   

21. And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

22. Let me pass through your land. We will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards. We will not drink the waters of the well. We will go along by the king's highway until we are past your borders.

23. And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. But Sihon gathered all his people, and went out against Israel in the wilderness. And he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.

24. And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon. For the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.

25. And Israel took all these cities. And Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon, and in all its villages.

26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.

27. Therefore they who speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.

28. For there has gone out a fire from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon.

29. Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons to be runaways, and his daughters to go into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.

30. We have cast them down. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah which is to Medeba.

31. So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.

33. And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.

34. And the LORD said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon.

35. So they struck him and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him alive. And they possessed his land.  

## Numbers 22

1. And the sons of Israel pulled up and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

3. And Moab was much afraid of the people because they were many. And Moab was worried because of the sons of Israel.

4. And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now this company is licking up all around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

5. He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, by the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold! A people come out from Egypt. Behold! They cover the face of the earth, and they are staying across from me.

6. Therefore, I pray you, come now and curse this people for me. For they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail so that we may strike them, and so that I may drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.

7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian pulled up with the rewards of divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him.

8. And he said to them, stay here tonight, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me. And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam and said, What men are these with you?

10. And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,

11. Behold! A people has come out of Egypt which covers the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me. Perhaps, I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out.

12. And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.

13. And Balaam rose up in the morning and said to the leaders of Balak, Go into your land, for the LORD refuses to let me go with you.

14. And the leaders of Moab rose up. And they went to Balak and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.   

15. And Balak sent leaders again, more and more honorable than those.

16. And they came to Balaam and said to him, So says Balak the son of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me.

17. For I will raise you up to very great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me. Please come then and curse this people for me.

18. And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.

19. But please now stay here also this night so that I may know what more the LORD will say to me.

20. And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, go with them. But still, the word which I shall say to you, that you shall do.

21. And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass, and went with the rulers of Moab.   

22. And God's anger was kindled because he went. And the Angel of the LORD stood in the way as an enemy against him. And he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants with him.

23. And the ass saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way, and His sword drawn in His hand. And the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field. And Balaam struck the ass, to turn her into the way.

24. But the Angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall on this side, and a wall on that side.

25. And when the ass saw the Angel of the LORD, she pushed herself into the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall. And he struck her again.

26. And the Angel of the LORD went further and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

27. And when the ass saw the Angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam. And Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the ass with a staff.

28. And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have beaten me these three times?

29. And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you.

30. And the ass said to Balaam, Am I not your ass, upon which you have ridden ever since I was yours, to this day? Was I ever known to do so to you? And he said, No.

31. Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way, and His sword drawn in His hand. And he bowed down his head, and fell on his face.

32. And the Angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you beaten your ass these three times? Behold! I went out to be an enemy to you, because your way is perverse before Me.

33. And the ass saw Me and turned from Me these three times. Unless she had turned from Me, surely now I also would have killed you and saved her alive.

34. And Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD, I have sinned. For I did not know that You stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases You, I will go back again.

35. And the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men. But only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the leaders of Balak.   

36. And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him, to a city of Moab, in the border of Arnon, which is in the outermost border.

37. And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able indeed to lift you up to honor?

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.

39. And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath-huzoth.

40. And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam and to the leaders that were with him.

41. And it happened on the next day Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal, so that from there he might see the edge of the people.  

## Numbers 23

1. And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare here seven oxen and seven rams for me.

2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam offered on the altar a bull and a ram.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me. And whatever He reveals to me I will tell you. And he went to a high place.

4. And God met Balaam. And he said to Him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon the altar a bull and a ram.

5. And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, Return to Balak, and so you shall speak.

6. And he returned to him. And lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the leaders of Moab.

7. And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.

8. How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? Or how shall I defy whom the LORD has not defied?

9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be counted among the nations.

10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have kept on blessing them!

12. And he answered and said, Must I not be careful to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?   

13. And Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place from where you may see them. You shall see only their edge, and shall not see them all. And curse them from there for me.

14. And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on every altar.

15. And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet Him yonder.

16. And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak and say this.

17. And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, What has the LORD spoken?

18. And he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear. Listen to me, son of Zippor.

19. God is not a man that He should lie, neither the son of man that He should repent. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?

20. Behold, I have received word to bless. And He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.

21. He has not seen iniquity in Jacob, neither has He seen perverseness in Israel. The LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king among them.

22. God brought them out of Egypt. He has, as it were, the strength of an ox.

23. Surely, there is no spell against Jacob, nor any fortune-telling against Israel. According to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What God has worked!

24. Behold, the people shall rise up like a great lion, and lift up himself like a young lion. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all.

26. But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Please, come. I will bring you into another place. Perhaps it will please God that you will curse them for me from there.

28. And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor that looks toward Jeshimon.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build seven altars here for me, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams here for me.

30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on the altar.  

## Numbers 24

1. And Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, and he did not go, as at other times, to seek for secret arts, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel pitched, according to their tribes. And the Spirit of God came upon him.

3. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said;

4. he has said; he who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling down but having his eyes open;

5. How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your tabernacles, O Israel!

6. They are spread forth like the valleys, like gardens by the river's side, like the trees of aloes which the LORD has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters.

7. He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters. And his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.

8. God brought him forth out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of an ox. He shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.

9. He crouched. He lay down as a lion, and as a great lion. Who shall stir him up? Blessed is he who blesses you, and curses he who curses you.   

10. And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam. And he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have kept on blessing these three times.

11. Therefore now flee to your place. I thought to lift you up to great honor, but lo, the LORD has kept you back from honor.

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,

13. If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the mouth of the LORD, to do good or bad of my own mind. What the LORD said, that I will speak.

14. And now, behold, I go to my people. Come! I will make known to you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.   

15. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said;

16. he has said, he who heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down but having his eyes open;

17. I shall see him, but not now. I shall behold him, but not near. There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel. and shall strike the corners of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult.

18. And Edom shall be a possession. Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies. And Israel shall do valiantly.

19. Out of Jacob shall come He who shall have dominion and shall destroy him who remains of the city.

20. And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable and said, Amalek was the first of the nations. But his latter end is to destruction.

21. And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable and said, Strong is your dwelling-place, and you put your nest in a rock.

22. But the Kenites shall be wasted until Assyria shall carry you away captive.

23. And he took up his parable and said, Alas, who shall live when God puts out!

24. And ships shall come from the coast of Cyprus, and shall afflict Assyria and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish forever.

25. And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place. And Balak also went his way.  

## Numbers 25

1. And Israel lived in Shittim, and the people began to fornicate with the daughters of Moab.

2. And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. And the people ate and bowed down to their gods.

3. And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.

4. And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

5. And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal-peor.   

6. And behold! One of the sons of Israel came and brought to his brothers a woman of Midian, before the eyes of Moses, and before all the congregation of the sons of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation and took a spear in his hand.

8. And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman, through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the sons of Israel.

9. And those that died in the plague were twenty-four thousand.

10. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

11. Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the sons of Israel while he was zealous for My sake among them, so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy.

12. Therefore say, Behold! I give him My covenant of peace.

13. And he shall have it, and his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the sons of Israel.

14. And the name of the Israelite who was killed, he who was struck with the woman of Midian, was Zimri, the son of Salu, ruler of a chief house of the Simeonites.

15. And the Midianite woman's name who was killed was Cosbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.   

16. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

17. Trouble the Midianites and strike them.

18. For they trouble you with their lies, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi the daughter of a ruler of Midian, their sister, who was stricken in the day of the plague because of Peor.

## Numbers 27

2. And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest, and before the rulers and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

3. Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of those who gathered themselves against the LORD in the company of Korah, but died in his own sin, and had no sons.

4. Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he has no son? Therefore give us a possession among the brothers of our father.

5. And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

6. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers. And you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

8. And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.

9. And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.

10. And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.

15. And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,

16. Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation

17. who may go out before them, and who may go in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD may not be as sheep which have no shepherd.

18. And the LORD said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him.

19. And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation, and give him a charge in their sight.

20. And you shall put of your honor on him, so that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may be obedient.

21. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask for him according to the judgment of Urim before the LORD. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, he and all the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

22. And Moses did as the LORD commanded him. And he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.

23. And he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge, even as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

40. And Moses told the sons of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.  

## Numbers 30

1. And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD has commanded:

2. If a man vows a vow to the LORD, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that comes out of his mouth.   

3.  If a woman also vows a vow to the LORD, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth,

4. and if her father hears her vow and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and if her father is silent as to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

5. But if her father does not allow her in the day that he hears, not any of her vows or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand. And the LORD shall forgive her because her father did not allow her.

6. And if she had a husband when she vowed, or if she said anything rash out of her lips with which she bound her soul,

7. and if her husband heard and is silent as to her in the day that he heard, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.

8. But if her husband did not allow her on the day that he heard it, then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul, of no effect. And the LORD shall forgive her.

9. But every vow of a widow and of her who is divorced, all which she has bound on her soul shall stand against her.

10. And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,

11. and if her husband heard and is silent as to her, and did not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.

12. But if her husband has certainly broken them on the day he heard, whatever comes out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has broken them. And the LORD shall forgive her.

13. Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may break it.

14. But if her husband is altogether silent as to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows or all her bonds which are on her. He confirms them, because he was silent as to her in the day that he heard.

15. But if he at all breaks them after he has heard, then he has borne her iniquity.

16. These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter in her youth in her father's house.  

## Numbers 31

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Avenge the sons of Israel from the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.

3. And Moses spoke to the people saying, Arm some of yourselves to the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD on Midian.

4. You shall send to the war a thousand from every tribe, throughout all the tribes of Israel.

5. So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

6. And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe. He sent them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand.   

7. And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses. And they killed all the males.

8. And they killed the kings of Midian, besides the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.

9. And the sons of Israel took all the women of Midian captive, and their little ones, and the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

10. And they burned with fire all their cities, their homes, and all their towers.

11. And they took all the spoil and all the prey of men and animals.

12. And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are beside Jordan, at Jericho.   

13. And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the rulers of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside the camp.

14. And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who came from the battle.

15. And Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?

16. Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit sin against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and the plague was on the congregation of the LORD.

17. And now kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.

18. But all the female children that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

19. And stay outside the camp seven days. Whosoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any dead one, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.

20. And purify all clothing, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

21. And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses.

22. Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,

23. everything that can stand the fire, you shall make go through the fire, and it shall be clean. Only it shall be purified with the water of separation. And all that cannot stand the fire you shall make go through the water.

24. And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterwards you shall come into the camp.   

25. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

26. Count the prey that was taken of man and of animal, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers of the congregation.

27. And divide the prey into two parts: between those skilled in the battle, who went out to war, and between all the congregation.

28. And levy a tax for the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, of the persons and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the flock.

29. Take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, a heave offering to the LORD.

30. And from the sons of Israel's half you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, of the flocks, of all kinds of animals, and give them to the Levites who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.

32. And the prize, the rest of the spoil which the men of war had captured, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,

33. seventy-two thousand beef cattle,

34. sixty-one thousand asses,

35. and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known a man by lying with a male.

36. And the half, the portion of those who went out to war, the number of the flock was three hundred thirty-seven thousand, five hundred;

37. and the LORD's tax of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.

38. And the beef cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the LORD's tax was seventy-two.

39. And the asses, thirty thousand, five hundred, of which the LORD's tax was sixty-one.

40. And the persons were sixteen thousand, of which the LORD's tax was thirty-two persons.

41. And Moses gave the tax, the LORD's heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.

42. And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men who warred;

43. even the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand, five hundred sheep,

44. and thirty-six thousand beef cattle,

45. and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,

46. and sixteen thousand persons;

47. even of the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one portion in fifty, of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, --even as the LORD commanded Moses.   

48. And the officers who were over thousands of the army, over the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came near Moses.

49. And they said to Moses, Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our charge, and there is not one man of us lacking.

50. And we bring an offering for the LORD, what every man has found, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.

51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all crafted things.

52. And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the commanders of thousands, and of the commanders of hundreds, was sixteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty shekels.

53.  For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.

54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD.  

## Numbers 32

1. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle. And when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, behold, the place was a place for cattle.

2. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the rulers of the congregation, saying,

3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land which the LORD struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle.

5. And, they said, If we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not bring us over Jordan.

6. And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?

7. And why do you break the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?

8. So your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.

9. For when they went up into the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they broke the hearts of the sons of Israel, so that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.

10. And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and He swore, saying,

11. Surely, none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and up, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not fully followed Me,

12. except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have fully followed the LORD.

13. And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation which had done evil in the sight of the LORD was destroyed.

14. And behold, you are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to add still more to the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.

15. For if you turn away from after Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness. And you shall destroy all this people.   

16. And they came near to him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones,

17. but we ourselves will go ready armed before the sons of Israel until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fenced cities because of those who live in the land.

18. We will not return to our houses until the sons of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

19. For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of Jordan, eastward.

20. And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will go armed before the LORD to war,

21. and all of you will go armed over Jordan before the LORD until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,

22. and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterwards you shall return and be guiltless before the LORD and before Israel. And this land shall be your possession before the LORD.

23. But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD. And be sure your sin will find you out.

24. Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do that which has come out of your mouth.

25. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.

26. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead.

27. But your servants will go over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord says.   

28. So regarding them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

29. And Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will go with you over Jordan, each armed to battle before the LORD, and the land shall be humbled before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.

30. But if they will not go over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

31. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do.

32. We will go over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, so that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.

33. And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities in the borders, the cities of the land all around.

34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,

35. and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

36. and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities. And they built folds for sheep.

37. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjath-aim,

38. and Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names being changed) and Sibmah, and they gave other names to the cities which they built.

39. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and put out the Amorite who was in it.

40. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns of it, and called them Havoth-jair.

42. And Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name.

51. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan,

52. then you shall drive out all those who live in the land from before you, and destroy all their carved images, and destroy all their molded images and pluck down all their high places.

53. And you shall possess the land, and live in it. For I have given you the land to possess it.

54. And you shall divide the land by lot by your families. And you shall give the more inheritance to the many; to the few you shall give the less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls out to him; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.

55. But if you will not drive out the people of the land from before you, then it will be, those of them whom you let remain shall be goads in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land in which you live.

56. And it shall be, as I thought to do to them, so I shall do to you.  

## Numbers 34

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel and say to them: When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan with its borders.

3. And your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the border of Edom, and your south border shall be the furthest coast of the Salt Sea eastward.

4. And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin. And its limit shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon.

5. And the border shall turn from Azmon to the torrent of Egypt, and the end of it shall be at the sea.

6. And for the western border, you shall even have the Great Sea for a border. This shall be your west border.

7. And this shall be your northern border. From the Great Sea you shall point out for you Mount Hor.

8. From Mount Hor you shall point your border to the entrance of Hamath. And the end of the border shall be at Zedad.

9. And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the end of it shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border.

10. And you shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.

11. And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain. And the border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the Sea of Chinnereth eastward.

12. And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the end of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with the borders of it all around.

13. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel saying, This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half tribe.

14. For the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to the house of their fathers. And half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.

15. The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.   

16. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

17. These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.

## Numbers 35

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab beside Jordan, at Jericho, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites, from the land of their possessions cities to live in. And you shall give to the Levites suburbs for the cities all around them.

3. And they shall have the cities to live in. And their open lands shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their animals.

4. And the open lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits all around.

5. And you shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits. And the city shall be in the middle. This shall be to them the open land of the cities.

6. And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which you shall appoint for the manslayer, so that he may flee there. And you shall add forty-two cities to them.

7. All the cities which you shall give to the Levites, forty-eight cities. You shall give them with their open land.

8. And the cities which you shall give shall be of the possessions of the sons of Israel. You shall give many from those who have many. But from those who have few you shall give few. Everyone shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inherits.   

9. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you have come over Jordan into the land of Canaan,

11. then you shall choose cities to be cities of refuge for you, so that the slayer who kills any person through error may flee there.

12. And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer does not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment.

13. And of those cities which you shall give, you shall have six cities for refuge.

14. You shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan to be cities of refuge.

15. These six cities shall be a refuge for the sons of Israel, and for the stranger, and for anyone who stays among them, so that everyone who kills any person through error may flee there.

16. And if he strikes him with an instrument of iron, so that he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.

17. And if he strikes him by throwing a stone, with which he may die, and if he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.

18. Or if he strikes him with a hand weapon of wood, with which he may die, and if he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death.

19. The revenger of blood himself shall kill the murderer. When he meets him, he shall kill him.

20. And if he stabs him from hatred, or hurls at him by lying in wait, so that he dies,

21. or in hatred strikes him with his hand so that he dies, he who struck him shall surely he put to death. He is a murderer. The revenger of blood will kill the murderer when he meets him.

22. But if he thrusts him suddenly without hatred, or has thrown something on him without lying in wait,

23. or with any stone with which a man may die if he does not see, and throws it upon him so that he dies, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm,

24. then the congregation shall judge between the one who kills and the revenger of blood according to these judgments.

25. And the congregation shall deliver the one who kills out of the hand of the revenger of blood. And the congregation shall send him back to the city of his refuge, to which he had fled. And he shall stay in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.

26. But if the one who killed shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge to which he had fled,

27. and if the avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of the city of his refuge, and if the avenger of blood kills the slayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,

28. because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the one who killed shall return to the land of his possession.

29. So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

30. Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses. But one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.

31. And you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death. But he shall surely be put to death.

32. And you shall take no ransom for him who has fled to the city of his refuge, to return to live in the land until the death of the high priest.

33. So you shall not defile the land in which you are. For blood defiles the land. And the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of him that shed it.

34. So do not defile the land which you shall inhabit, in which I dwell. For I the LORD dwell among the sons of Israel.  

## Numbers 36

1. And the chief fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses, and before the rulers, the chief fathers of the sons of Israel.

2. And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel. And my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

3. And if they are married to any of the sons of the tribes of the sons of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe to which they are received. So it shall be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

4. And when the jubilee of the sons of Israel shall come, then their inheritance shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received. So their inheritance shall be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.   

5. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of the LORD saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.

6. This is the thing which the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best. Only they shall marry into the family of the tribe of their father.

7. So the inheritance of the sons of Israel shall not be moved from tribe to tribe. For every one of the sons of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

8. And every daughter that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel shall become a wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel may each one enjoy the inheritance of his fathers.

9. And the inheritance shall not move from one tribe to another tribe. But every one of the tribes of the sons of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

10. Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did.

11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.

12. They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.

13. These are the commandments and the judgments which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab beside Jordan, at Jericho.
