5. I am black, but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

7. Tell me, You whom my soul loves, where do You feed, where do You lie down at noon? For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of Your companions?

## Song of Songs 2

1. I am the rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.

2. As the lily among thorns, so is My love among the daughters.

10. My Beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, My love, My beautiful one, and come away.

11. For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over; it goes to itself.

12. the flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;

13. the fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, My love, My beautiful one, and come away.   

14. O My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let Me see your face, let Me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is beautiful.

16. My Beloved is mine, and I am His; He feeds among the lilies.

17. Until when does the day blow, and the shadows flee away? Turn, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the mountains of Bether.  

## Song of Songs 3

1. By night on my bed I sought Him whom my soul loved; I sought Him, but I did not find Him.

2. I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the broad ways; I will seek Him whom my soul loves. I sought Him, but I did not find Him.

3. The watchmen going about the city found me. I said, Have you seen Him whom my soul loves?

4. But a little while after I passed from them, I found Him whom my soul loves. I held Him and would not let Him go, until I had brought Him into my mother's house, and into the room of her who conceived me.

5. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the does of the field, do not stir up nor awake my love until it pleases.

2. Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, which came up from the washing; they all are bearing twins and not one is barren among them.

3. Your lips are like a cord of scarlet, and your speech is becoming; your temples are like a piece of pomegranate behind your veil.

4. Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

6. Until when the day blows, and the shadows flee away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.

7. You are all fair, My love; no blemish is in you.   

8. Come with Me from Lebanon, My spouse; with Me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

9. You have ravished My heart, My sister, My spouse; you have ravished My heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.

10. How fair is your love, My sister, My spouse! How much better are your loves than wine, and the smell of your ointments than all spices!

4. My Beloved put in His hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for Him.

5. I rose up to open to my Beloved; and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers flowing with myrrh on the handles of the bolt.

6. I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had left. He passed on. My soul went out when He spoke; I sought Him, but I could not find Him. I called Him, but He did not answer me.

4. O my love, you are as beautiful as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as inspiring as an army with banners.

5. Turn away your eyes from Me, for they have overcome Me; your hair is like a flock of goats that appears from Gilead.

7. Your temples behind your veil are like a piece of pomegranate.

8. There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.

9. But My dove, My undefiled is one alone. She is the only one of her mother. She is the choice of her who bore her. The daughters saw her and blessed her; the queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.

## Song of Songs 7

1. How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.

2. Your navel is like a round goblet, which never lacks mixed wine; your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.

3. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.

4. Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes like the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Beth-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.

5. Your head on you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple cloth; the King is held captive in its tresses.

6. How beautiful and how pleasant you are, O love, for delights!

7. Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.

8. I said, I will go up in the palm tree, I will take hold of its stalk. And please let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples;

9. and the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my Beloved, that goes down smoothly for My Beloved, flowing softly over the lips of sleeping ones.   

10. I am my Beloved's, and His desire is toward me.

11. Come, my Beloved, let us go out into the field; let us stay in the villages.

12. Let us rise up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flowers, whether the tender grape appears, and the pomegranates bud forth; there I will give You my loves.

13. The love-apples give a scent, and over our doors are all pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for You, O my Beloved.  

## Song of Songs 8

1. Who could give You to me as my brother, who sucked my mother's breasts? When I find You outside, I would kiss You; yea, they would not despise me.

2. I would lead You, and bring You into my mother's house. You would instruct me; I would cause You to drink spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

3. His left hand would be under my head, and His right embrace me.

4. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, why should you stir up or awaken my Love until it pleases?   

5. Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her Beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree; there your mother travailed with you; there she travailed and bore you.

6. Set me as a seal on Your heart, as a seal on Your arm; for love is strong as death. Jealousy is cruel as the grave; its flames are flames of fire, a flame of Jehovah.

7. Many waters cannot quench love, nor will the rivers overflow it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be scorned.   

8. We have a little sister, and she has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

9. If she is a wall, we will build on her a palace of silver; and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.

10. I was a wall, and my breasts like towers; then I was in His eyes as one finding peace.

11. Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; everyone for its fruit was to bring a thousand of silver.

12. My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and for the keepers of its fruit, two hundred.   

13. You who dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice; cause me to hear.

14. Hurry, my Beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young deer, the stag, on the mountains of spices.
