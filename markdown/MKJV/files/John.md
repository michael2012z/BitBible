# John

## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. He was in the beginning with God.

3. All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.

4. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.   

5. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.

6. There was a man sent from God; his name was John.

7. This one came as a witness, to bear witness concerning the Light, so that all might believe through him.

8. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

9. He was the true Light; He enlightens every man coming into the world.

10. He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and the world did not know Him.

11. He came to His own, and His own received Him not.

12. But as many as received Him, He gave to them authority to become the children of God, to those who believe on His name,

13. who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God.

14. And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us. And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and of truth.   

15. John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I spoke: He who comes after me has been before me, for He was preceding me.

16. And out of His fullness we all have received, and grace for grace.

17. For the law came through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18. No one has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.   

19. And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?

20. And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.

21. And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.

22. Then they said to him, Who are you so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?

23. He said, I am "the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord," as the prophet Isaiah said.

24. And they who were sent were from the Pharisees.

25. And they asked him and said, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that Prophet?

26. John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but One stands among you whom you do not know.

27. He it is who, coming after me, who has been before me; of whom I am not worthy to loosen the thong of His sandal.

28. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.   

29. The next day John sees Jesus coming to him and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!

30. This is He of whom I said, After me comes a Man who has been before me, for He preceded me.

31. And I did not know Him, but that He be revealed to Israel, therefore I have come baptizing with water.

32. And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and He abode on Him.

33. And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water, that One said to me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He is the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.

34. And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God.

35. Again, the next day afterward, John stood with two of his disciples.

36. And looking upon Jesus as He walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!   

37. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

38. Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is called, being translated Teacher), where do you live?

39. He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He lived, and stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.

40. One of the two who heard John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

41. He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).

42. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which translated is, A stone).   

43. The day after, Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.

44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the law and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

46. And Nathanael said to him, Can there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile!

48. Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.

49. Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!

50. Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.

51. And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.  

## John 2

1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And the mother of Jesus was there.

2. And Jesus and His disciples were both invited to the marriage.

3. And when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.

4. Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have to do with you? My hour has not yet come.

5. His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do it.

6. And there were six stone waterpots there, according to the purification of the Jews, each containing two or three measures.

7. Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

8. And He said to them, Now draw out and carry it to the master of the feast. And they carried it.

9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine (and did not know where it was from, but the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.

10. And he said to him, Every man at the beginning sets forth good wine, and when men have drunk well, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now.

11. This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee. And it revealed His glory. And His disciples believed on Him.   

12. After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples. And they did not stay there many days.

13. And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14. And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.

15. And when He had made a scourge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, also the sheep and the oxen. And He poured out the money-changers' money and overthrew the tables.

16. And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here. Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.

17. And His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up."

18. Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do you show us, since you do these things?

19. Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.

20. Then the Jews said, This temple was forty-six years building, and will you rear it up in three days?

21. But He spoke of the temple of His body.

22. Therefore when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.   

23. And as He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did.

24. But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men

25. and did not need that anyone should testify of man. For He knew what was in man.  

## John 3

1. And there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

2. He came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles which you do unless God is with him.

3. Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?

5. Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

7. Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.

8. The Spirit breathes where He desires, and you hear His voice, but you do not know from where He comes, and where He goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?

10. Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?

11. Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what we know and testify what we have seen. And you do not receive our witness.

12. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

13. And no one has ascended up to Heaven except He who came down from Heaven, the Son of man who is in Heaven.

14. But even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,

15. so that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

16. For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

17. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.

18. He who believes on Him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the condemnation, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds were evil.

20. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be exposed.

21. But he who practices truth comes to the Light so that his deeds may be made known, that they have been worked in God.   

22. After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. And He stayed there with them and baptized.

23. And John was also baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.

24. For John had not yet been cast into prison.

25. Then a question from John's disciples arose with the Jews about purifying.

26. And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, He baptizes, and all come to Him!

27. And John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from Heaven.

28. You yourselves bear witness to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him.

29. He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Then my joy is fulfilled.

30. He must increase, but I must decrease.

31. He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is earthly and speaks from the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all,

32. and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.

33. He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.

34. For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.

35. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.

36. He who believes on the Son has everlasting life, and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.  

## John 4

1. Therefore when the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John

2. (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),

3. He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.   

4. And it was necessary for Him to go through Samaria,

5. Then He came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. And Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with His journey, sat thus upon the well. It was about the sixth hour.

7. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.

8. (For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)

9. Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask a drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews do not associate with Samaritans.

10. Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water.

11. The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have that living water?

12. Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children and his cattle?

13. Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,

14. but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

15. The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.

16. Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.

17. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband

18. for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In that you spoke truly.

19. The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

21. Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither worship the Father in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem.

22. You worship what you do not know, we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.

23. But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him.

24. God is a spirit, and they who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.

25. The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When He has come, He will tell us all things.

26. Jesus said to her, I AM, He speaking to you.   

27. And upon this His disciples came and marveled that He talked with the woman. However, no one said, What do You seek, or why do You talk with her?

28. The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to the men,

29. Come see a man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?

30. And they went out of the city and came to Him.

31. In the meantime His disciples were asking Him, saying, Master, eat.

32. But He said to them, I have food to eat which you do not know.

33. Therefore the disciples said to one another, No one brought Him anything to eat?

34. Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.

35. Do you not say, There are still four months and then the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white to harvest already.

36. And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to life eternal, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.

37. And in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.

38. I sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Other men labored, and you have entered into their labor.

39. And many of the Samaritans of that city believed upon Him because of the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I ever did.

40. Then as the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him that He would stay with them. And He stayed there two days.

41. And many more believed because of His own word.

42. And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying, for we have heard Him ourselves and know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.   

43. And after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.

44. For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own native-place.

45. Then when He had come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.

46. Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.

47. When He heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him that He would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.

48. Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.

49. The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies.

50. Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went away.

51. And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Your son lives.

52. Then he asked of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

53. So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole house.

54. This is the second miracle Jesus did, when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.  

## John 5

1. After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. Now there is a pool at the Sheep Gate at Jerusalem, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.

3. In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, of blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

4. For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water. Then whoever first stepped in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.

5. And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.

6. When Jesus saw him lying, and knowing that he had spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to be made whole?

7. The infirm man answered Him, Sir, when the water is troubled, I have no one to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.

8. Jesus says to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk.

9. And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. And it was a sabbath on that day.

10. Therefore the Jews said to him who had been healed, It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up the bed.

11. He answered them, He who made me whole said to me, Take up your bed and walk.

12. Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?

13. And he did not know Him who had cured him, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place.

14. Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more lest a worse thing come to you.

15. The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.

16. And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the sabbath day.   

17. But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.

18. Then, because of this, the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was His father, making Himself equal with God.

19. Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do. For whatever things He does, these also the Son does likewise.

20. For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all the things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel.

21. For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, even so the Son of man makes alive whomever He will.

22. For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,

23. so that all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.

25. Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear shall live.

26. For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life within Himself,

27. and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.

28. Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear His voice,

29. and shall come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil to the resurrection of condemnation.

30. I can do nothing of My own self. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of the Father who has sent Me.   

31. If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.

32. There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.

33. You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.

34. But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say so that you might be saved.

35. He was a burning and shining light, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.

36. But I have greater witness than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.

37. And He sending Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness of Me. Neither have you heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape.

38. And you do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He has sent.

39. You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life. And they are the ones witnessing of Me,

40. and you will not come to Me that you might have life.

41. I do not receive honor from men.

42. But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.

43. I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me. If another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.

44. How can you believe, you who receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?

45. Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.

46. For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me.

47. But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe My words?  

## John 6

1. After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, the Sea of Tiberias.

2. And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His miracles which He did on the sick ones.

3. And Jesus went up into a mountain and sat there with His disciples.

4. And the Passover was near, a feast of the Jews.

5. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and saw a great crowd come to Him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy loaves so that these may eat?

6. And He said this to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.

7. Philip answered Him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not enough for them, that every one may take a little.

8. One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,

9. There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are these among so many?

10. And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.

11. And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted.

12. And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing is lost.

13. Therefore they gathered and filled twelve handbaskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over to those who had eaten.

14. Then seeing the miracle that Jesus did, those men said, This is truly the Prophet, the One coming into the world.   

15. Therefore when Jesus perceived that they would come and take Him by force, that they might make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain alone by Himself.

16. And when evening had come, the disciples went down to the sea

17. and entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.

18. And the sea rose up because of a great wind that blew.

19. Then having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the ship. And they were afraid.

20. But He said to them, I AM! Do not be afraid.

21. Then they willingly received Him into the boat. And immediately the ship was at the land where they were going.   

22. The following day, the crowd standing on the other side of the sea had seen that there was no other little boat there except that one into which His disciples had entered, and when they saw that Jesus did not go with His disciples into the little boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone,

23. (however, other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the loaves, the Lord having given thanks),

24. therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

25. And when they had found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did you come here?

26. Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.

27. Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you. For God the Father sealed Him.   

28. Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?

29. Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on Him whom He has sent.

30. Therefore they said to Him, What sign do you show then, so that we may see and believe you? What do you work?

31. Our fathers ate the manna in the desert, as it is written, "He gave them bread from Heaven to eat."

32. Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you that bread from Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from Heaven.

33. For the bread of God is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.

34. Then they said to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

35. And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes on Me shall never thirst.

36. But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.

37. All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will in no way cast out.

38. For I came down from Heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.

39. And this is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day.

40. And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes on Him should have everlasting life. And I will raise him up at the last day.

41. Then the Jews murmured about Him, because He said, I am the bread which came down from Heaven.

42. And they said, Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How now does this One say, I have come down from Heaven?

43. Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur with one another.

44. No one can come to Me unless the Father who has sent Me draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.

45. It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught of God." Therefore everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me.

46. Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God, He has seen the Father.

47. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes on Me has everlasting life.

48. I am the Bread of life.

49. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.

50. This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven, so that a man may eat of it and not die.

51. I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he shall live forever. And truly the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

52. Then the Jews argued with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

53. Then Jesus says to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.

54. Whoever partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

55. For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.

56. He who partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood dwells in Me, and I in him.

57. As the living Father has sent Me, and I live through the Father, so he who partakes of Me, even he shall live by Me.

58. This is the Bread which came down from Heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he who partakes of this Bread shall live forever.

59. He said these things in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.   

60. Then when they had heard, many of His disciples said, This is a hard saying, who can hear it?

61. But knowing in Himself that His disciples murmured about it, Jesus said to them, Does this offend you?

62. Then what if you should see the Son of man going up where He was before?

63. It is the Spirit that makes alive, the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life.

64. But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who was to betray Him.

65. And He said, Because of this I said to you that no one can come to Me unless it was given to him from My Father.

66. From this time many of His disciples went back into the things behind, and walked no more with Him.

67. Then Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you also wish to go away?

68. Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.

69. And we have believed and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

70. Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And one of you is a devil?

71. But he spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for it was he who was about to betray Him, being one of the Twelve.  

## John 7

1. After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He did not desire to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.

2. And the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.

3. Therefore His brothers said to Him, Move away from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.

4. For no one does anything in secret, while he himself seeks to be in public. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.

5. For His brothers did not believe in Him.

6. Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.

7. The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its works are evil.

8. You go up to this feast; I am not yet going up to this feast; for My time is not yet fulfilled.

9. And saying He these things to them, He remained in Galilee.

10. But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.

11. Then the Jews sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?

12. And there was much murmuring among the crowd concerning Him, for some said, He is a good man; others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.

13. However, no one spoke openly of Him, because of the fear of the Jews.   

14. Now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.

15. And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, not being taught?

16. Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.

17. If anyone desires to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.

18. He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.

19. Did not Moses give you the law? And yet not one of you keeps the law! Why do you seek to kill Me?

20. The crowd answered and said, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?

21. Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.

22. Because of this Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath day.

23. If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath day so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry at Me because I have made a man entirely sound on the sabbath day?

24. Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.

25. Then some of those from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one they seek to kill?

26. But lo, he speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is the Christ indeed?

27. However, we know this one, from where he is; but when Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.

28. Then Jesus cried in the temple as He taught, saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I come. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.

29. But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent Me.

30. Then they sought to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.

31. And many of the crowd believed on Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more miracles than these which this One has done?

32. The Pharisees heard that the crowd murmured such things concerning Him. And the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.

33. Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go to Him who sent Me.

34. You shall seek Me and shall not find Me. And where I am, you cannot come.

35. Then the Jews said among themselves, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?

36. What saying is this that He said, You shall seek Me and shall not find Me, and where I am, you cannot come?   

37. And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.

38. He who believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."

39. (But He spoke this about the Spirit, which they who believed on Him should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)

40. Then when they heard the Word, many of the people said, Truly this is the Prophet.

41. Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Does the Christ come out of Galilee?

42. Has the Scripture not said that Christ comes from the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?

43. So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.

44. And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.   

45. Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why have you not brought him?

46. The officers answered, Never did any man speak as does this Man.

47. Then the Pharisees answered them, Are you not also deceived?

48. Not any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

49. But this crowd, not knowing the law, is cursed.

50. Nicodemus said to them, (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them),

51. Does our law judge the Man before it hears Him and knows what He does?

52. They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search the scriptures and see that a prophet has not been raised out of Galilee.

53. And they each went to his own house.  

## John 8

1. But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

2. And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him. And He sat down and taught them.

3. And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery. And standing her in the midst,

4. they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

5. Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. You, then, what do you say?

6. They said this, tempting Him so that they might have reason to accuse Him. But bending down, Jesus wrote on the ground with His finger, not appearing to hear.

7. But as they continued to ask Him, He lifted Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.

8. And again bending down, He wrote on the ground.

9. And hearing, and being convicted by conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, until the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

10. And bending back up, and seeing no one but the woman, Jesus said to her, Woman, where are the ones who accused you? Did not one give judgment against you?

11. And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I give judgment. Go, and sin no more.   

12. Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

13. Therefore the Pharisees said to Him, You bear record concerning yourself, your witness is not true.

14. Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record concerning Myself, My witness is true. For I know from where I came, and where I go. But you do not know from where I came, and where I go.

15. You judge after the flesh, I judge no one.

16. And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.

17. It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.

18. I am one who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness concerning Me.

19. Then they said to Him, Where is your father? Jesus said to them, You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.

20. Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the temple. And no man laid hands upon Him, for His hour had not yet come.   

21. Then Jesus said again to them, I go away, and you shall seek Me and shall die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come.

22. Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? Because he says, Where I go you cannot come.

23. And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.

24. Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins, for if you do not believe that I AM, you shall die in your sins.

25. Then they said to Him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even the same which I also say to you.

26. I have many things to say and to judge of you, but He who sent Me is true, and I speak to the world those things what I heard of Him.

27. They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.

28. Then Jesus said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I AM, and that I do nothing of Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.

29. And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things which please Him.

30.  As He spoke these words, many believed upon Him.   

31. Then Jesus said to the Jews who believed on Him, If you continue in My word, you are My disciples indeed.

32. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

33. They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to anyone. How do you say, You will be made free?

34. Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever practices sin is the slave of sin.

35. And the slave does not abide in the house forever, but the Son abides forever.

36. Therefore if the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.

37. I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me because My Word has no place in you.   

38. I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you, then, do what you have seen with your father.

39. They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus answered them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.

40. But now you seek to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I have heard beside God; this Abraham did not do.

41. You do the deeds of your father. Then they said to Him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, even God.

42. Jesus said to them, If God were your father, you would love Me, for I went forth and came from God; for I did not come of Myself, but He sent Me.

43. Why do you not know My speech? Because you cannot hear My word.

44. You are of the Devil as father, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not abide in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.

45. And because I tell you the truth, you do not believe Me.   

46. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?

47. He who is of God hears God's words. Therefore you do not hear them because you are not of God.

48. Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?

49. Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.

50. And I do not seek My own glory, but there is One who seeks and judges.   

51. Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keeps My Word, he shall never see death.

52. Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets are dead, and you say, If a man keeps my Word, he shall never taste of death.

53. Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself?

54. Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.

55. Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I should say I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I know Him and I keep His Word.

56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and He saw and was glad.

57. Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?

58. Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I AM!

59. Then they took up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus hid Himself and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and passed on by.  

## John 9

1. And passing by, He saw a man who was blind from birth.

2. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?

3. Jesus answered, Neither has this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.

4. I must work the works of Him who sent Me, while it is day. Night comes when no man can work.

5. As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.

6. And when He had spoken these things, He spat on the ground and made clay from the spittle. And He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.

7. And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which translated is Sent). Therefore he went and washed and came seeing.   

8. Then the neighbors and those who had seen him before, that he was blind, said, Is this not he who was sitting and begging?

9. Some said, This is he. Others said, He is like him. He said, I am he.

10. Then they said to him, How were your eyes opened?

11. He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And going and washing, I received sight.

12. Then they said to him, Where is he? He said, I do not know.   

13. They brought him who once was blind to the Pharisees.

14. And it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

15. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.

16. Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a man, a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

17. They said to the blind man again, What do you say about him, for he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

18. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him having received sight.

19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?

20. His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.

21. But by what means he now sees, we do not know. Or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age, ask him. He will speak for himself.

22. His parents spoke these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed that He was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

23. Therefore his parents said, He is of age, ask him.

24. Then a second time they called the man who was blind and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.

25. He answered and said, Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that being blind, now I see.

26. Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?

27. He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also desire to be His disciples?

28. Then they reviled him and said, You are his disciple, but we are Moses' disciples.

29. We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know from where this man is.

30. The man answered and said to them, Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know from where He is, and He has opened my eyes.

31. But we know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.

32. From everlasting it was not heard that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind.

33. If this One were not of God, He could do nothing.

34. They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.   

35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, He said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?

36. And he answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?

37. And Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and it is He who is speaking with you.

38. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped Him.   

39. And Jesus said, I have come into this world for judgment, that they who do not see might see, and that they who see might be made blind.

40. And those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, Are we also blind?

41. Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, We see. Therefore your sin remains.  

## John 10

1. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter into the sheepfold by the door, but going up by another way, that one is a thief and a robber.

2. But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. The doorkeeper opens to him, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

4. And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him. For they know his voice.

5. And they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.

6. Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what it was which He spoke to them.

7. Then Jesus said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

8. All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.

9. I am the door. If anyone enters in by Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.

10. The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come so that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

11. I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.

12. But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away. And the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.

13. The hireling flees, because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep.

14. I am the Good Shepherd, and I know those that are Mine, and I am known by those who are Mine.

15. Even as the Father knows Me, I also know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.

16. And I have other sheep who are not of this fold. I must also lead those, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.

17. Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I might take it again.

18. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down from Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment from My Father.   

19. Then a division occurred again among the Jews because of these words.

20. And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you hear him?

21. Others said, These are not words of one who has been possessed by a demon. A demon is not able to open the eyes of blind ones.   

22. And the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem, and it was winter.

23. And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's Porch.

24. Then the Jews encircled Him and said to Him, How long do you make us doubt? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.

25. Jesus answered them, I told you and you did not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me.

26. But you did not believe because you are not of My sheep. As I said to you,

27. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.

28. And I give to them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish, and not anyone shall pluck them out of My hand.

29. My Father who gave them to me is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.

30. I and the Father are one!

31. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.

32. Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from My Father; for which of these do you stone Me?

33. The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.

34. Jesus answered them, Has it not written in your law, "I said, You are gods?"

35. If He called those gods with whom the Word of God was, and the Scripture cannot be broken,

36. do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?

37. If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me.

38. But if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.   

39. Then they again sought to seize Him, but He went forth out of their hand.

40. And He went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John baptized at the first, and He stayed there.

41. And many came to Him and said, John indeed did no miracle, but all things that John said concerning this One were true.

42. And many believed on Him there.  

## John 11

1. And there was a certain sick one, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

2. (And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

3. Then his sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.

4. When Jesus heard, He said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God might be glorified by it.

5. And Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

6. Therefore, when He had heard that he was sick, then indeed He remained two days in the place where He was.

7. Then after that He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.

8. The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews lately have sought to stone You, and do You go there again?

9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.

10. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because there is no light in him.

11. He said these things; and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.

12. Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well.

13. But Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of taking rest in sleep.

14. Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

15. And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.

16. Then Thomas (he being called Twin) said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.   

17. Then when Jesus came, He found him already being held in the tomb four days.

18. And Bethany was near Jerusalem, fifteen stadia away.

19. And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to comfort them concerning their brother.

20. Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she met Him. But Mary was sitting in the house.

21. Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.

22. But I know that even now, whatever You will ask of God, God will give You.

23. Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.

24. Martha said to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

25. Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life! He who believes in Me, though he die, yet he shall live.

26. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?

27. She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world.

28. And saying these things, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher has come and calls you.

29. As soon as she heard, she arose quickly and came to him.

30. Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.

31. Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, they followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.

32. Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, seeing Him, Mary fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.   

33. Then when He saw her weeping, and also the Jews who came with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.

34. And He said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. Then the Jews said, Behold how He loved him!

37. And some of them said, Was not this Man who opened the eyes of the blind able also to cause that even this one should not have died?

38. Then Jesus, groaning in Himself again, came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

39. Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who died, said to Him, Lord, by this time he stinks. For it is the fourth day.

40. Jesus answered her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?

41. Then they took away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.

42. And I know that You hear Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it, so that they may believe that You have sent Me.

43. And saying these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, Here! Outside!

44. And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with sheets, and his face was bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Untie him and let him go!   

45. Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.

46. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

47. Then the chief priests and Pharisees gathered a sanhedrin, and said, What can we do? For this man does many miracles.

48. If we let him alone this way, all will believe on him. And the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.

49. And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest of that year, said to them, You do not know anything at all,

50. nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.

51. And he did not speak this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;

52. and not for that nation only, but also that He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.

53. Then from that day they took counsel together that they might kill Him.

54. Therefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but He went away from there to a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and continued there with His disciples.

55. And the Jews' Passover was near. And many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.

56. Then they sought Jesus, and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you, that He will not at all come to the feast?

57. And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that if anyone knew where He was, he should make it known so that they might seize Him.  

## John 12

1. Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was (who had died, whom He raised from the dead).

2. Then they made a supper there for Him. And Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.

3. Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.

4. Then said one of His disciples (Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray Him)

5. Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?

6. He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried the things put in.

7. Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has kept this for the day of My burial.

8. For you have the poor with you always; but you do not always have Me.

9. Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come for Jesus' sake only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.

10. But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death also,

11. because many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus because of him.   

12. On the next day, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd who had come to the Feast

13. took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And they cried, Hosanna! "Blessed is the King of Israel who comes in the name of the Lord!"

14. And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it; as it is written,

15. "Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes sitting on the foal of an ass."

16. But His disciples did not know these things at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him.

17. Then the crowd witnessed, those who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead.

18. Because of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.

19. Then the Pharisees said among themselves, Do you see how you gain nothing? Behold, the world has gone after Him.   

20. And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the Feast.

21. Then these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.

22. Philip came and told Andrew. And again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.

24. Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.

25. He who loves his life shall lose it. And he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.

26. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant shall be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.   

27. And My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this cause I came to this hour.

28. Father, glorify Your name! Then there came a voice from the heaven saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.

29. Then the crowd who stood by and heard said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to Him.

30. Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sakes.

31. Now is the judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

32. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.

33. But He said this, signifying what kind of death He was about to die.

34. The crowd answered Him, We have heard out of the law that Christ lives forever. How do you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?

35. Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness come upon you. For he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.

36. While you have the Light, believe in the Light so that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and was hidden from them.   

37. But though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they did not believe on Him,

38. so that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"

39. Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,

40. "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."

41. Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.   

42. Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe on Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;

43. for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.   

44. But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes on Me does not believe on Me but on Him who sent Me.

45. And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.

46. I have come as a Light into the world, so that whoever believes on Me should not remain in darkness.

47. And if any one hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him, for I do not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

48. He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

49. For I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.

50. And I know that His command is life everlasting. Therefore whatever I speak, even as the Father said to Me, so I speak.  

## John 13

1. And before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come when He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own in the world, He loved them to the end.

2. And when supper had ended, the Devil now having put into the heart of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon to betray Him,

3. Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and went to God,

4. He rose up from supper and laid aside His garments. And He took a towel and girded Himself.

5. After that He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.

6. Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered and said to him, You do not know what I do now, but you shall know hereafter.

8. Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.

9. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and head.

10. Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet, but is clean every whit. And you are clean, but not all.

11. For He knew who would betray Him. Therefore He said, You are not all clean.

12. So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?

13. You call Me the Teacher, and Lord, and you say well, for I AM.

14. If then I, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.

15. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.

16. Truly, truly, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master, neither is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.

17. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.   

18. I do not speak of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me."

19. From now I tell you before it comes, so that when it happens you may believe that I AM.

20. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives Me. And he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.

21. When Jesus had said this, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you shall betray Me.

22. Then the disciples looked upon one another, wondering of whom He spoke.

23. But there was one of His disciples leaning upon Jesus' bosom, the one whom Jesus loved.

24. Simon Peter therefore signaled to him to ask whom it might be of whom He spoke.

25. And lying on Jesus' breast, he said to him, Lord, who is it?

26. Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the morsel when I have dipped it. And dipping the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

27. And after the morsel, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.

28. But no one reclining knew for what reason He spoke this to him.

29. For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy what we have need of for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.

30. He then, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.   

31. Then when he had left, Jesus said, Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.

32. If God is glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall immediately glorify Him.

33. Little children, I am with you yet a little while. You shall seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come, so I now say to you.

34. I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. As I have loved you, you should also love one another.

35. By this all shall know that you are My disciples, if you have love toward one another.   

36. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where do You go? Jesus answered him, Where I go you cannot now follow Me, but you shall follow Me afterward.

37. Peter said to Him, Lord, why cannot I follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.

38. Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for My sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow until you have denied Me three times.  

## John 14

1. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in Me.

2. In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

3. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, so that where I am, you may be also.   

4. And where I go you know, and the way you know.

5. Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You go, and how can we know the way?

6. Jesus said to him, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one comes to the Father but by Me.

7. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also. And from now on you know Him and have seen Him.

8. Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.

9. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. And how do you say, Show us the Father?

10. Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak of Myself, but the Father who dwells in Me, He does the works.

11. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the very works themselves.   

12. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes on Me, the works that I do he shall do also, and greater works than these he shall do, because I go to My Father.

13. And whatever you may ask in My name, that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

14. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.   

15. If you love Me, keep My commandments.

16. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, so that He may be with you forever,

17. the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive because it does not see Him nor know Him. But you know Him, for He dwells with you and shall be in you.   

18. I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.

19. Yet a little while and the world does not see Me any more. But you see Me. Because I live, you shall live also.

20. At that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.

21. He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.

22. Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?

23. Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loves Me, he will keep My Word. And My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.

24. He who does not love Me does not keep My words, and the Word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me.   

25. I have spoken these things to you, being present with you.

26. But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.

27. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.   

28. You have heard how I said to you, I go away and I am coming to you again. If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father, for My Father is greater than I.

29. And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens you might believe.

30. I shall no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of this world comes, and he has nothing in Me.

31. But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has given Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go away from here.  

## John 15

1. I am the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser.

2. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away. And every one that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bring forth more fruit.

3. Now you are clean through the Word which I have spoken to you.

4. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.

5. I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.

6. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered. And they gather and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

7. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.

8. In this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, so you shall be My disciples.   

9. As the Father has loved Me, so I have loved you; continue in My love.

10. If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.

11. I have spoken these things to you so that My joy might remain in you and your joy might be full.

12. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.

13. No one has greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

14. You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.

15. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master does. But I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.

16. You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you shall ask of the Father in My name, He may give it to you.

17. These things I command you, that you love one another.   

18. If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.

19. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

20. Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept My saying, they will also keep yours.

21. But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.

22. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. He who hates Me hates My Father also.

24. If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they would not have had sin. But now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father.

25. But that the Word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, "They hated Me without a cause."   

26. And when the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He shall testify of Me.

27. And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.  

## John 16

1. I have spoken these things to you so that you should not be offended.

2. They shall put you out of the synagogue. But an hour is coming that everyone who kills you will think that he bears God service.

3. And they will do these things to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.

4. But I have told you these things so that when the hour shall come you may remember that I told you of them. And I did not say these things to you at the beginning because I was with you.

5. But now I go to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, Where do You go?

6. But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.   

7. But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart, I will send Him to you.

8. And when that One comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.

9. Concerning sin, because they do not believe on Me;

10. concerning righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;

11. concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.

12. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.

13. However, when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth. For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatever He hears, He shall speak. And He will announce to you things to come.

14. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will announce it to you.

15. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and will announce it to you.   

16. A little while and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.

17. Then His disciples said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you will not see Me, and again a little and you will see Me? And, Because I go to the Father?

18. Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is saying.

19. Then Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and said to them, Do you seek answers with one another concerning this, because I said, A little while and you shall not see Me; and again a little while, and you shall see Me?

20. Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

21. The woman has grief when she bears, because her hour has come. But when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the joy that a man is born into the world.

22. And therefore you now have sorrow. But I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.   

23. And in that day you shall ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in My name, He will give you.

24. Before now you have asked nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.

25. I have spoken these things to you in parables, but the time is coming when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but I will show you plainly of the Father.

26. At that day you will ask in My name; and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,

27. for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.   

28. I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world. Again I leave the world and go to the Father.

29. The disciples said to Him, Lo, now You speak plainly and speak no parable.

30. Now we know that You know all things and do not need that anyone should ask You. By this we believe that You have come forth from God.

31. Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?

32. Behold, the hour comes, yea, has now come, that you will be scattered, each man to his own things, and you will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.

33. I have spoken these things to you so that you might have peace in Me. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world.  

## John 17

1. Jesus spoke these words and lifted up His eyes to Heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son so that Your Son also may glorify You,

2. even as You have given Him authority over all flesh so that He should give eternal life to all You have given Him.

3. And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.

4. I have glorified You upon the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.

5. And now Father, glorify Me with Yourself with the glory which I had with You before the world was.   

6. I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave to Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.

7. Now they have known that all things, whatever You have given Me, are from You.

8. For I have given to them the words which You gave Me, and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from You. And they have believed that You sent Me.

9. I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.

10. And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I am glorified in them.   

11. And now I am in the world no longer, but these are in the world, and I come to You, Holy Father. Keep them in Your name, those whom You have given Me, so that they may be one as We are.

12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those that You have given Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

13. And now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world that they might have My joy fulfilled in them.

14. I have given them Your Word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

15. I do not pray for You to take them out of the world, but for You to keep them from the evil.

16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.   

17. Sanctify them through Your truth. Your Word is truth.

18. As You have sent Me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.

19. And I sanctify Myself for their sakes, so that they also might be sanctified in truth.   

20. And I do not pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on Me through their word,

21. that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You have sent Me.

22. And I have given them the glory which You have given Me, that they may be one, even as We are one,

23. I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them as You have loved Me.   

24. Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me, that they may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me, for You have loved Me before the foundation of the world.

25. O righteous Father, indeed the world has not known You; but I have known You, and these have known that You have sent me.

26. And I made known to them Your name, and will make it known, so that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.  

## John 18

1. Having spoken these words, Jesus went out with His disciples over the winter stream Kidron, where there was a garden. He and His disciples entered into it.

2. And Judas who betrayed Him also knew the place. For Jesus oftentimes went there with His disciples.

3. Then Judas, having received a band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

4. Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon Him, went out and said to them, Whom do you seek?

5. They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas who betrayed Him also stood with them.

6. Then as soon as He had said to them, I AM, they went backward and fell to the ground.

7. Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

8. Jesus answered, I have told you that I AM. Therefore if you seek Me, let these go away;

9. (that the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, " Of those whom You have given Me, I have lost not one of them").

10. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus.

11. Then Jesus said to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath. The cup which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?

12. Then the band, and the captain, and under-officers of the Jews together seized Jesus and bound Him.   

13. And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.

14. And Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

15. And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.

16. But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple went out, the one who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her who kept the door and brought Peter in.

17. Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.

18. And the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold. And they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.

19. Then the high priest asked Jesus of His disciples and of His teaching.

20. Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where the Jews always resort, and I have said nothing in secret.

21. Why do you ask Me? Ask those who heard me what I have said to them. Behold, they know what I said.

22. And when He had spoken this way, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so?

23. Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?

24. Then Annas had sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

25. And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Then they said to him, Are you not also one of his disciples? He denied and said, I am not.

26. One of the servants of the high priest, being kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?

27. Peter then denied again. And immediately a cock crowed.   

28. Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium. And it was early. And they did not go into the praetorium, that they should not be defiled, and that they might eat the Passover.

29. Then Pilate went out to them and said, What charge do you bring against this man?

30. They answered and said to him, If he were not an evildoer, then we would not have delivered him up to you.

31. Then Pilate said to them, You take him and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death

32. (that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke signifying what death He was about to die).

33. Then Pilate entered into the praetorium again and called Jesus and said to him, Are you the king of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered him, Do you say this thing of yourself, or did others say it to you about Me?

35. Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?

36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would fight so that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.

37. Pilate then said to Him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say it that I am a king. To this end I was born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.

38. Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I find no fault in him.

39. But you have a custom that I should release one to you at the Passover. Then do you desire that I release to you the king of the Jews?

40. Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas! But Barabbas was a robber.  

## John 19

1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and flogged Him.

2. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and put it on His head. And they put a purple robe on Him,

3. and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck Him with their hands.

4. Then Pilate went out again and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him.

5. Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man!

6. Then when the chief priests and under-officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in him.

7. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

8. Then when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid.

9. And he went again into the praetorium and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.

10. Then Pilate said to him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?

11. Jesus answered, You could have no authority against Me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.

12. From this time, Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.

13. Then when Pilate heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement (but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha).

14. And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your king!

15. But they cried out, Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.   

16. Then he delivered Him up to them that He might be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him away.

17. And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called, The Place of a Skull (which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha)

18. where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.   

19. And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.

21. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, the king of the Jews, but that he said, I am king of the Jews.

22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

23. Then when they had crucified Jesus, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, one part to each soldier; and also His tunic. And the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

24. Therefore they said among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to find whose it shall be (that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, "They parted my garments among them, and for my garment they cast lots"). Therefore the soldiers did these things.

25. And His mother stood by the cross of Jesus, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26. Then when Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son!

27. Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home.

28. After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst.

29. Then a vessel full of sour wine was set. And they filled a sponge with sour wine and put it upon hyssop, and put it to His mouth.

30. Then when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up the spirit.   

31. Then the Jews, because it was Preparation, begged Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath. For that sabbath was a high day.

32. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him.

33. But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.

34. But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a lance, and instantly there came out blood and water.

35. And he who saw bore record, and his record is true. And he knows that he speaks true, so that you might believe.

36. For these things were done so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of Him shall be broken."

37. And again another Scripture says, "They shall look upon Him whom they pierced."   

38. And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews) begged of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.

39. And Nicodemus also came, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.

40. Then they took the body of Jesus and wound it with linens with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews to bury.

41. And in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one yet had been placed.

42. There, then, because of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.  

## John 20

1. The first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, darkness still being on it, and she saw the stone taken away from the tomb.

2. Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.

3. Therefore Peter and that other disciple went forth and came to the tomb.

4. So they both ran together. And the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb.

5. And stooping down he saw the linens lying, yet he did not go in.

6. Then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb. And he saw the linens lying there.

7. And the grave-cloth that was on His head was not lying with the linens, but was wrapped up in one place by itself.

8. Therefore, then, that other disciple also went in, the one who came first to the tomb. And he saw and believed.

9. For as yet they did not know the Scripture that He must rise again from the dead.

10. Then the disciples went away again to themselves.   

11. But Mary stood outside of the tomb, weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb.

12. And she saw two angels in white sitting there, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

13. And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.

14. And when she had said this, she turned backward and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

15. Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away from here, tell me where you have laid Him and I will take Him away.

16. Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned herself and said to Him, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master!)

17. Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and Your Father, and to My God and your God.

18. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that He had spoken these things to her.   

19. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you!

20. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.

21. Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As My Father has sent Me, even so I send you.

22. And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.

23. Of whomever sins you remit, they are remitted to them. Of whomever sins you retain, they are retained.

24. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I shall see the print of the nails in His hands, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.   

26. And after eight days the disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace to you!

27. Then He said to Thomas, Reach your finger here and behold My hands; and reach your hand here and thrust it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.

28. And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!

29. Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen Me you have believed. Blessed are they who have not seen and have believed.

30. And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.

31. But these are written so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life in His name.  

## John 21

1. After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He revealed Himself this way:

2. Simon Peter, and Thomas called the Twin, and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.

3. Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We will go with you also. They went out and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.

4. But when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

5. Then Jesus said to them, Children, Do you have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.

6. And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find. Therefore they cast, and now they no longer had the strength to draw, from the multitude of fish.

7. Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loves said to Peter, It is the Lord! Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on his coat (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.

8. And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits), dragging the net of fish.

9. Then when they went up on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish lying on it, and bread.

10. And Jesus said to them, Bring from the fish which you have now caught.

11. Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty-three. And though there were so many, the net was not torn.

12. Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And none of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.

13. Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.

14. This is now the three times Jesus was revealed to His disciples, He being risen from the dead.   

15. Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.

16. He said to him the second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My sheep.

17. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him a third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.

18. Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry you where you do not wish.

19. He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.   

20. Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following (the one who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he who betrays You?)

21. Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what of this one?

22. Jesus said to him, If I desire that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.

23. Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die, but, If I desire that he remain until I come, what is that to you?

24. This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.

25. And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which, if they should be written singly, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.
