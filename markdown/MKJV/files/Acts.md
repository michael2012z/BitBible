# Acts

## Acts 1

1. Truly, O Theophilus, I made the first report as to all things that Jesus began both to do and teach

2. until the day He was taken up, having given directions to the apostles whom He chose, through the Holy Spirit;

3. to whom He also presented Himself living after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them through forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

4. And having met with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father which you heard from Me.

5. For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.   

6. Then, indeed, these coming together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, do You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. And He said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in His own authority.

8. But you shall receive power, the Holy Spirit coming upon you. And you shall be witnesses to Me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the end of the earth.

9. And saying these things, as they watched, He was taken up. And a cloud received Him out of their sight.

10. And while they were looking intently into the heaven, He having gone, even behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,

11. who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into the heaven? This same Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven, will come in the way you have seen Him going into Heaven.   

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount Of Olive Grove, which is a sabbath day's journey from Jerusalem.

13. And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James;

14. these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.   

15. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said, ( the number of names together was about a hundred and twenty,)

16. Men, brothers, this Scripture must have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who became guide to those who seized Jesus.

17. For he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry.

18. Indeed, then, this one purchased a field with the reward of unrighteousness. And falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.

19. And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem, so much so that that field is called in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is to say, Field of Blood.

20. For it is written in the Book of Psalms, "Let his estate become forsaken, and he not be living in it." And, "Let another take his overseership."

21. Therefore, it is right that one of these men who have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,

22. beginning from the baptism of John to that same day that He was taken up from us, to become a witness with us of His resurrection.

23. And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And they prayed and said, You, Lord, knower of all hearts, show which one You chose from these two,

25. to take the share of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell, to go to his own place.

26. And they gave forth their lots. And the lot fell upon Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.  

## Acts 2

1. And in the fulfilling of the day of Pentecost, they were all with one accord in one place.

2. And suddenly a sound came out of the heaven as borne along by the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And tongues as of fire appeared to them, being distributed; and it sat upon each of them.

4. And they were all filled of the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.   

5. And dwelling at Jerusalem there were Jews, devout men out of every nation under heaven.

6. But this sound occurring, the multitude came together and were confounded, because they each heard them speaking in his own dialect.

7. And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, are not these who speak all Galileans?

8. And how do we each hear in our own dialect in which we were born?

9. Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,

10. Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking the great things of God in our own languages.

12. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying to one another, What does this mean?

13. But others mocking said, These men are full of sweet wine.   

14. But Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, Men, Jews, and all who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.

15. For these are not drunk as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.

16. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:

17. "And it shall be in the last days, says God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.

18. And in those days I will pour out My Spirit upon My slaves and My slave women, and they shall prophesy.

19. And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and miracles on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

20. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before that great and glorious Day of the Lord.

21. And it shall be that everyone who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

22. Men, Israelites, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by powerful works, and wonders and miracles, which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,

23. this One given to you by the before-determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and by lawless hands, crucifying Him, you put Him to death;

24. whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.

25. For David speaks concerning Him, "I foresaw the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.

26. Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad; and also My flesh shall rest in hope,

27. because You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your holy One to see corruption.

28. You revealed to Me the ways of life. You will fill Me with joy with Your countenance."

29. Men, brothers, it is permitted to say to you with plainness as to the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.

30. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit upon his throne,

31. seeing this beforehand, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor would His flesh see corruption,

32. God raised up this Jesus, of which we all are witnesses.

33. Therefore being exalted to the right of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which you now see and hear.

34. For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself, "The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

35. until I place Your enemies as a footstool to Your feet."

36. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.   

37. And hearing this, they were stabbed in the heart, and said to Peter and to the other apostles, Men, brothers, what shall we do?

38. Then Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.

40. And with many other words he earnestly testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.

41. Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added about three thousand souls.   

42. And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, and in fellowship and in the breaking of the loaves, and in prayers.

43. And fear came on every soul. And many wonders and miracles took place through the apostles.

44. And all who believed were together and had all things common.

45. And they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.

46. And continuing with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they shared food with gladness and simplicity of heart,

47. praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.  

## Acts 3

1. And on the same day Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.

2. And a certain man, who was lame from his mother's womb, was being carried. And they laid him daily at that temple gate which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered into the temple.

3. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.

4. And fastening his eyes on him, Peter with John said, Look on us!

5. And he paid heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!

7. And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up. And immediately his feet and ankle-bones received strength.

8. And leaping up, he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God.

10. And they recognized him, that it was him who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

11. And as the lame one who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.   

12. And seeing this, Peter answered the people, Men, Israelites, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you stare at us, as though we had made this man to walk by our own power or holiness?

13. The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His son Jesus, whom you delivered up, denying Him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let Him go.

14. But you denied the Holy and Just One and desired a murderer to be given to you.

15. And you killed the Prince of Life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.

16. And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, this one whom you see and know, His name made firm. And the faith which came through Him has given him this perfect soundness before you.

17. And now, brothers, I know that you did it through ignorance, as also your rulers did.

18. But those things which God before had shown by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He fulfilled in this manner.

19. Therefore repent and convert so that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.

20. And He shall send Jesus Christ, who before was proclaimed to you,

21. whom Heaven truly needs to receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began.

22. For Moses truly said to the fathers, " The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet to you from your brothers, One like me. You shall hear Him in all things, whatever He may say to you.

23. And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people."

24. And also all the prophets from Samuel and those following after, as many as spoke, have likewise foretold of these days.

25. You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in your Seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."

26. Having raised up His son Jesus, God sent Him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you away from his iniquities.  

## Acts 4

1. And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the temple commander, and the Sadducees came on them,

2. being grieved that they taught the people, even to announce through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3.  And they laid hands on them and put them under guard until the next day, for it was already evening.

4. But many of those who heard the Word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.   

5. And it happened on the next day that their rulers and elders and scribes, gathered to Jerusalem,

6. and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.

7. And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name have you done this?

8. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,

9. if we are examined today on a good work for an infirm man, by what this one has been healed,

10. be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this name does this man stand before you whole.

11. This is the Stone which you builders have counted worthless, and He has become the Head of the Corner.

12. And there is salvation in no other One; for there is no other name under Heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

13. But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlearned and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.

14. And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.   

15. And when they had commanded them to go aside out of the sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,

16. saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all those dwelling in Jerusalem. And we cannot deny it.

17. But, so that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak to no man in this name from now on.

18. And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right before God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.

20. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

21. So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way as to how they might punish them, because of the people. For all glorified God for that which was done.

22. For the man on whom this miracle of healing occurred was more than forty years old.   

23. And being let go, they went to their own company and reported what the chief priests and elders had said to them.

24. And having heard, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, You are the God who made the heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them;

25. who by the mouth of Your servant David has said, "Why did the nations rage and the people imagine vain things?

26. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ."

27. For truly, against Your holy child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and the people of Israel, were gathered together

28. in order to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done.

29. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your Word,

30. by stretching forth of Your hand for healing, and miracles, and wonders may be done by the name of Your holy child Jesus.

31. And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.   

32. And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul. And not one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own. But they had all things common.

33. And the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power. And great grace was on them all.

34. For neither was anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold,

35. and they laid them down at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to every man according as he had need.

36. And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being translated, The son of consolation), a Levite, a Cypriot by race,

37. a field being his, selling it, he bore the proceeds and placed them at the apostles' feet.  

## Acts 5

1. And a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.

2. And he kept back part of the price, his wife also knowing, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?

4. While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own authority? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.

5. And hearing these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And great fear came on all those who heard these things.

6. And the younger ones arose, wound him up, and carrying him out, they buried him.

7. And it was about the space of three hours afterward, when his wife (not knowing what was done) came in.

8. And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.

9. Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out.

10. Then at once she fell down at his feet and expired. And the younger ones found her dead, and, carrying her out, buried her beside her husband.

11. And great fear came on all the church and on as many as heard these things.   

12. And many miracles and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch.

13. And of the rest no one dared to join himself to them, but the people magnified them;

14. and more believing ones were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;

15. So as to carry out the sick into the streets and place them on cots and mattresses, so that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

16. And also a multitude came from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick ones, and those being tormented by unclean spirits, who were all healed.   

17. And rising up, the high priest, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with anger,

18. And laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public custody.

19. But the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night and brought them out, and said,

20. Go! Stand and speak all the words of this Life to the people in the temple.

21. And hearing, they went into the temple about dawn, and taught. But the high priest came, and those with him. And they called the sanhedrin together, and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

22. But having come near, the officers did not find them in the prison. And returning, reported,

23. saying, We indeed found the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside in front of the doors. But having opened it, we found no one inside.

24. And when the high priest and the temple commander and the chief priests heard these things, they were bewildered about them, what this might be.

25. But one came, reporting to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.   

26. Then the commander went with the officers and brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.

27. And bringing them, they stood in the sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,

28. saying, Did we not strictly command you that you not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood on us.

29. And Peter and the apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed and hanged on a tree.

31. This One God has exalted to be a Ruler and Savior to His right hand in order to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.

32. And we are His witnesses of these things. And so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.

33. But those hearing were cut to the heart, and they took counsel to kill them.

34. Then there stood up one in the sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law honored among all the people. And he commanded the apostles to be put outside a little space.

35. And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.

36. For before these days Theudas rose up, boasting himself to be somebody; a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him; who was slain. And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nothing.

37. After this one, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the Registration, and drew away considerable people after him. Yet that one perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.

38. And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and let them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing.

39. But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God.

40. And they obeyed him. And calling the apostles, beating them, they commanded not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41. Then indeed they departed from the presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be shamed for His name.

42. And every day in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching the gospel: Jesus Christ.  

## Acts 6

1. And in those days, the disciples having multiplied, a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews occurred, because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving.

2. And the Twelve called near the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not pleasing to us, leaving the Word of God, to serve tables.

3. Therefore, brothers, look out among you seven men being witnessed to, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this duty.

4. But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.

5. And the saying pleased all the multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch.

6. They set these before the apostles. And having prayed, they laid hands on them.

7. And the word of God was increasing. And the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was multiplying exceedingly; even a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith.   

8. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.

9. Then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and from Asia, disputing with Stephen.

10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.

11. And they induced men to be saying, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.

12. And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes. And coming on, they seized him and brought him to the sanhedrin.

13. And they set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law.

14. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.

15. And looking intently at him. all those sitting in the sanhedrin saw his face as if it were the face of an angel.  

## Acts 7

1. Then the high priest said, Then do you so hold these things?

2. And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.

3. And He said to him, "Go out from your land and from your kindred, and come into a land which I shall show you."

4. Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, he moved into this land in which you now dwell.

5. And He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not even a foot-breadth. And He promised that He would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, there being no child to him.

6. And God spoke in this way, that his seed would be a tenant in another land, and that they would enslave it and oppress it four hundred years.

7. And God said, "I will judge the nation to whom they shall be in bondage," and "after these things they will come out and will serve Me in this place."

8. And He gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham fathered Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day. And Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.

9. And being jealous of Joseph, the patriarchs sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him

10. and plucked him out from all his afflictions, and He gave him favor and wisdom over against Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his household.

11. But a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and a great affliction. And our fathers found no food.

12. But hearing grain was in Egypt, Jacob sent out our fathers first.

13. And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was made known to Pharaoh.

14. And seeing, Joseph called his father Jacob, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.

15. And Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers,

16. and were carried over into Shechem. And they were laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price of silver from the sons of Emmor the father of Shechem.   

17. But as the time was drawing near, of the promise which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

18. until another king arose who did not know Joseph.

19. Dealing subtly with our race, this one oppressed our fathers, causing their infants to be exposed, so as not to be left alive.

20. In this time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God, who was brought up three months in his father's house.

21. And he being cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and reared him for a son to her.

22. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds.

23. And when a period of forty years was fulfilled to him, it arose in his heart to look upon his brothers, the sons of Israel.

24. And seeing one being wronged, he defended him. and avenged him who was oppressed and struck the Egyptian.

25. For he thought his brothers would understand that God would give them deliverance by his hand. But they did not understand.

26. And the next day he appeared to them while fighting. And he urged them to peace, saying, Men, you are brothers, why do you wrong one another?

27. But he who wronged his neighbor thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Will you not kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?

29. And Moses fled at this word, and became a temporary resident in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.   

30. And forty years being fulfilled to him, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in a flame of fire in a bush.

31. And seeing it, Moses marveled at the sight. And as he drew near to see, the voice of the Lord came to him:

32.  saying, "I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." But Moses trembled and dared not look.

33. Then the Lord said to him, "Loosen the sandal on your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground."

34. "I have seen, the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I have heard their groan; and I came down to pluck them out. And now come, I will send you into Egypt."

35. This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? God has sent this one to be a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the Bush.

36. He brought them out after he had worked wonders and miracles in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness forty years.

37. This is that Moses who said to the sons of Israel, " The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet to you from your brothers, One like me; you shall hear Him."

38. This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received the living words to give to us,

39. to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him away and turned back again to Egypt in their hearts,

40. saying to Aaron, "Make us gods to go before us, for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."

41. And they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the work of their own hands.   

42. Then God turned and gave them over to serve the host of the heavens, as it is written in the book of the Prophets: "O house of Israel, have you offered to Me slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness?

43. Yea, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, images which you made in order to worship them; and I will remove you beyond Babylon."

44. The tabernacle of witness was among our fathers in the wilderness, as commanded by God, speaking to Moses to make it according to the pattern that he had seen.

45. Which also having received it by inheritance with Joshua, our fathers, with Joshua, in taking possession of the nations whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,

46. who found favor with God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob;

47. but Solomon built Him a house.

48. But, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,

49. "Heaven is My throne and earth is My footstool. What house will you build Me, says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?

50. Has not My hand made all these things?"   

51. O stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so you do.

52. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you have now been the betrayers and murderers;

53. who received the Law through disposition of angels, and did not keep it.   

54. And hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts. And they gnashed on him with their teeth.

55. But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking up intently into Heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.

56. And he said, Behold, I see Heaven opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

57. And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and ran on him with one accord.

58. And throwing him outside the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid their clothes down at the feet of a young man named Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen, who was calling on God and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.  

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was consenting to his death. And in that day there was a great persecution on the church at Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And devout men buried Stephen and made a great mourning over him.

3. But Saul ravaged the church, entering into every house. And dragging men and women, he delivered them up to prison.   

4. Then, indeed, the ones who had been scattered passed through, preaching the gospel, the Word.

5. And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.

6. And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the many miracles which he did.

7. For out of those having unclean spirits, many came out, crying with loud voice. And many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.

8. And there was great joy in that city.

9. But a certain man called Simon had long been conjuring in the city, and amazing the nation of Samaria, claiming himself to be some great one.

10. All gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, This one is the great power of God.

11. And they were paying attention to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with conjuring.

12. But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel, the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13. Then Simon himself believed also, and being baptized, he continued with Philip. And seeing miracles and mighty works happening, he was amazed.   

14. And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them;

15. who when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

16. For as yet He had not fallen on any of them, they were baptized only in the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,

19. saying, Give me this power also, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.

20. But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

21. You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God.

22. Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.

23. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.

24. And answering Simon said, You pray to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken may come on me.

25. Then, indeed, having earnestly testified and having spoken the Word of the Lord also having preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans, they returned to Jerusalem.   

26. And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south, on the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a deserted place.

27. And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to worship,

28. was returning. And sitting in his chariot he read Isaiah the prophet.

29. Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.

30. And Philip ran there to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you indeed understand what you are reading?

31. And he said, How can I unless some man should guide me? And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.

32. And the content of the Scripture which he read was this: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so He opened not His mouth.

33. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth."

34. And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beg you, of whom does the prophet speak this? Of himself or of some other man?

35. Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached the gospel of Jesus to him.

36. And as they passed along the way, they came on some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water, what hinders me from being baptized?

37. Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, it is lawful. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.

39. And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.  

## Acts 9

1. And Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest

2. and asked letters from him to Damascus to the synagogues; so that if he found any of the Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. But in going, it happened as he drew near to Damascus, even suddenly a light from the heaven shone around him.

4. And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?

5. And he said, Who are you, lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.

6. And trembling and astonished, he said, Lord, what will You have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.

7. And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, indeed hearing a voice but seeing no one.

8. And Saul was lifted up from the earth, his eyes were opened, but he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.

9. And he was three days not seeing, and did not eat or drink.   

10. And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold me, Lord.

11. And the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,

12. and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him so that he might receive his sight.

13. And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints at Jerusalem.

14. And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your Name.

15. But the Lord said to him, Go! For this one is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel.

16. For I will show him what great things he must suffer for My name's sake.

17. And Ananias went and entered into the house. And putting his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, Jesus, who appeared to you in the way in which you came, has sent me to you that you might see and be filled with  the Holy Spirit.

18. And instantly scales as it were fell from his eyes, and he instantly saw again. And rising up, he was baptized.

19. And taking food, he was strengthened. And Saul was certain days with the disciples in Damascus.

20. And immediately he proclaimed Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.

21. But all who heard him were amazed and said, Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that reason, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?

22. But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this One is the Christ.   

23. And after many days had been fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him.

24. But their plot was known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night in order to kill him.

25. Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a basket.

26. And arriving in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join himself to the disciples. But they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and told them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had spoken boldly in Damascus in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem.

29. And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and argued with the Hellenists. But they seized him in order to kill him.

30. But knowing, the brothers brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.

31. Then, indeed, the churches had rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and having been built up. And having gone on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were increased.   

32. And it happened, passing through all, Peter also came down to the saints who lived at Lydda.

33. And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had lain eight years on a mattress, paralyzed.

34. And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you; rise up and spread for yourself! And he arose immediately.

35. And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.   

36. And in Joppa was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which translated is called Dorcas). She was full of good works and kind deeds which she did.

37. And it happened in those days, becoming sick, she died. And washing her, they laid her in an upper room.

38. And, because Lydda was near Joppa, hearing that Peter is in it, the disciples sent two men to him, begging him not to delay to come to them.

39. And rising up, Peter went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper room. And all the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them.

40. And putting them all out, Peter knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise! And she opened her eyes. And when she saw Peter, she sat up.

41. And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. And when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.

42. And it was known throughout all Joppa. And many believed in the Lord.

43. And it was many days that he remained in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.  

## Acts 10

1. And a certain man named Cornelius was in Caesarea, a centurion of the Italian cohort,

2.  one devout and fearing God, with all his household, both doing many merciful deeds to the people, and praying continually to God.

3. About the ninth hour of the day he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius!

4. And he was gazing at him, and becoming terrified, he said, What is it, lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your merciful deeds have come up for a memorial before God.

5. And now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, whose last name is Peter.

6. He is staying with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside. He will tell you what you must do.

7. And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from those who waited on him continually.

8. And explaining all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.   

9. On the next day, as these went on the road, and drawing near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.

10. And he became very hungry and desired to eat. But while they made ready, an ecstasy fell on him.

11. And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a sheet coming down to him, being bound at the four corners and let down to the earth;

12. in which were all the four-footed animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of the heaven.

13. And a voice came to him, saying, Rise, Peter! Kill and eat!

14. But Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.

15. And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has made clean, you do not call common.

16. This happened three times, and the vessel was received up again into the heaven.

17. And while Peter doubted within himself what the vision which he had seen might be, even behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had asked for Simon's house and stood on the porch.

18. And they called and asked if Simon whose last name is Peter was staying there.   

19. And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are looking for you.

20. Therefore arise and go down and go with them without doubting, for I have sent them.

21. And going down to the men, those sent to him from Cornelius, Peter said, Behold, I am the one you are seeking. For what reason have you come?

22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and one who fears God, and one of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear words from you.

23. Then he called them in and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa went with him.

24. And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

25. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped.

26. But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up! I also am a man myself.

27. And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.

28. And he said to them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man, a Jew to keep company with or to come near to one of another nation. But God has shown me not to call any man common or unclean.

29. Therefore I came without complaint, being sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me.

30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.

31. And he said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your merciful deeds have been remembered before God.

32. Therefore send to Joppa and call here Simon whose last name is Peter, he is staying in the house of Simon, a tanner by the seaside; who, when he comes, shall speak to you.

33. Therefore I immediately sent to you, and you have done well to come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded you by God.   

34. Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I see that God is no respecter of persons;

35. but in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted with Him.

36. You know the word which God sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all!);

37. that word which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed;

38. how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and He went about doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed Him and hanged Him on a tree;

40. but God raised Him up the third day and showed Him openly,

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses hand-picked before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.

42. And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.

43. All the prophets give witness to Him, that through His name whoever believes in Him shall receive remission of sins.   

44. While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those hearing the Word.

45. And those of the circumcision, who believed (as many as came with Peter), were astonished because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the nations also.

46. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,

47. Can anyone forbid water that these, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, should not be baptized?

48. And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay certain days.  

## Acts 11

1. And the apostles and brothers who were in Judea heard that the nations had also received the Word of God.

2. And when Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,

3. saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them.

4. But Peter related the matter from the beginning and explained it by order to them, saying,

5. I was in the city of Joppa praying. And in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel like a sheet coming down, let down from the sky by four corners. And it came even to me.

6. When I had fastened my eyes on it, I looked and saw four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and birds of the heaven.

7. And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter! Kill and eat!

8. But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.

9. But the voice answered me again from the heaven, What God has made clean, you do not call common.

10. And this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into the heaven.

11. And behold, immediately three men stood at house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.

12. And the Spirit told me to go with them, not discriminating. And these six brothers went with me, and we entered the man's house.

13. And he declared to us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa and call for Simon whose last name is Peter,

14. who will tell you words by which you and all your house shall be saved.

15. And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.

16. And I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

17. Therefore because God gave them the same gift to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?

18. When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance to life to the nations.   

19. Then, indeed, they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that rose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one except the Jews.

20. And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene; who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

22. And the Word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem. And they sent out Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch;

23. who was glad when he had come and had seen the grace of God. And he exhorted all with purpose of heart to remain near to the Lord.

24. For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And many people were added to the Lord.

25. And Barnabas went out to Tarsus to seek Saul.

26. And finding him, it was a whole year they were gathered to them in the church and taught a considerable crowd. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.   

27. And in these days prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch.

28. And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine over the world (which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar).

29. And the disciples, as any were prospered, determined each of them to send for ministry to those brothers who lived in Judea,

30. which they also did, sending to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.  

## Acts 12

1. And at that time Herod the king threw on his hands to oppress some of those of the church.

2. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

3. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he went further to seize Peter also. (And they were days of Unleavened Bread.)

4. And capturing him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four sets of four soldiers to keep him; intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.   

5. Then, indeed, Peter was kept in prison. But earnest prayer was made to God for him by the church.

6. And when Herod was about to bring him out, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Also guards were keeping the prison before the door.

7. And behold! An angel of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the building. And striking Peter's side, he raised him up, saying, Rise up quickly! And his chains fell off his hands.

8. And the angel said to him, Gird yourself and put on your sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Throw your robe around you and follow me.

9. And he went out and followed him. And he did not know that this happening through the angel was true, but thought he saw a vision.

10. When they were past the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. And they went out and passed on through one street. And immediately the angel departed from him.

11. And having come to himself, Peter said, Now I know surely that the Lord has sent His angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. And thinking about it, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose last name was Mark; where many had gathered together to pray.

13. And as Peter knocked at the door of the porch, a girl named Rhoda came to listen.

14. And when she knew Peter's voice, she did not open the porch because of gladness, but running in she reported Peter was standing before the porch.

15. And they said to her, You are mad. But she kept on saying that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.

16. But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened and saw him, they were amazed.

17. But, waving to them with his hand to be quiet, he declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go tell these things to James and to the brothers. And he departed and went into another place.

18. And day coming, there was not a little stir among the soldiers, saying, What, then, became of Peter.

19. And searching for him, and not finding him, examining the guards, Herod commanded them to be led away to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed.   

20. And Herod was in bitter hostility with the men of Tyre and Sidon. But they came to him with one accord and, having made Blastus (who had charge of the king's bedroom) their friend, desired peace, because their country was fed by the king's country.

21. And on a certain day, Herod sat on his throne, dressed in royal clothing, and made a speech to them.

22. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god and not of a man!

23. And immediately the angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory. And he was eaten by worms and gave up the spirit.

24. But the Word of God grew and increased.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled the ministry, having taken with them John, whose last name was Mark.  

## Acts 13

1. And in Antioch some among the existing church were prophets and teachers. (such as Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.

2.  As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, So, then, separate Barnabas and Saul to Me for the work to which I have called them.

3. Then having fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they let them go.   

4. Then these indeed sent out by the Holy Spirit went down to Seleucia. And from there they sailed to Cyprus.

5. And when they were at Salamis, they announced the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as an assistant.

6. And when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain conjurer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-jesus;

7. who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He called for Barnabas and Saul and asked to hear the Word of God.

8. But Elymas the conjurer (for so his name is, if translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

9. Then Saul (who is also Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him

10. and said, O son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all craftiness, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?

11. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you. And you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a while. And immediately a mist and a darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

12. Then, seeing the thing happening, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

13. And Paul and those around him sailed from Paphos and came to Perga of Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem.   

14. But going through from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down.

15. And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if you have any word of comfort for the people, speak.

16. And rising up and signaling with his hand, Paul said, Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, listen.

17. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people in their residency in the land of Egypt, and He brought them out of it with a high arm.

18. And about the time of forty years He tenderly bore them in the wilderness.

19. And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave their land to them as an inheritance.

20. And after that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

21. And afterward they asked for a king. And God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

22. And when He had removed him, He raised up David to them to be their king; to whom He also witnessed and said, I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after My own heart, who shall fulfill all My will.

23. Of this man's seed God has raised to Israel, according to His promise, a Savior, Jesus;

24. John having before proclaimed the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel, before His coming.

25. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Who do you think that I am? I am not He. But behold, One comes after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.

26. Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, the word of this salvation is sent to you.

27. For those living in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known this One, and the voices of the prophets being read throughout every sabbath, condemning Him, they fulfilled the Scriptures.

28. And finding not one cause of death in Him, they begged Pilate to do away with Him.

29. And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, taking Him down from the tree, they laid Him in a tomb.

30. But God raised Him from the dead,

31. who appeared for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.

32. And we preach the gospel to you, the promise made to the fathers,

33. this God has fulfilled to us their children, raising up Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son, this day I have begotten You."

34. And that He raised Him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He spoke in this way: "I will give you the holy promises of David."

35. Therefore he also says in another psalm, "You shall not allow Your Holy One to see corruption."

36. For after he had served his own generation by the will of God, David fell asleep and was added to his fathers and saw corruption.

37. But He whom God raised again saw no corruption.

38. Therefore be it known to you, men, brothers, that through this One the forgiveness of sins is announced to you.

39. And by Him all who believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.

40. Therefore beware lest that come on you which is spoken of in the prophets:

41. "Behold, you despisers, and marvel, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no way believe, though a man declare it to you."   

42. And the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations begged that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.

43. And the synagogue being broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44. And on the coming sabbath day almost all the city came together to hear the Word of God.

45. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and contradicted those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

46. But speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first. But since indeed you put it far from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the nations.

47. For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, "I have set You to be a light of the nations, for salvation to the end of the earth."

48. And hearing, the nations rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.

49. And the Word of the Lord was carried throughout all the country.

50. But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief ones of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas. And they threw them out of their borders.

51. But shaking the dust of their feet off on them, they came into Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.  

## Acts 14

1. And it happened in Iconium, they both went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke so as a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the nations and made them evil-hearted against the brothers.

3. Therefore they stayed a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who bore witness to the word of His grace, giving miracles and wonders to be done by their hands.

4. But the multitude of the city was divided. And part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.

5. And when there was an assault made by both the nations and the Jews, with their rulers, in order to insult and to stone them,

6. they were aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the country around them.

7. And there they were preaching the gospel.   

8. And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, without strength in the feet, being lame from his mother's womb, who never had walked.

9. This one heard Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,

10. said with a loud voice, Stand up on your feet! And he leaped and walked.

11. And seeing what Paul did, the crowd lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men.

12. And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.

13. And the priest of Jupiter, being before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, wishing to sacrifice with the crowds.

14. But hearing this, the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out

15. and saying, Men, why do you do these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preaching the gospel to you to turn you from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them;

16. who in past generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.

17. And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving rain and fruitful season to us from heaven, filling our hearts with food and gladness.

18. And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the people from sacrificing to them.   

19. And Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who, having persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, they drew him out of the city, supposing him to have died.

20. But the disciples surrounding him, he rose up and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. And preaching the gospel to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,

22. confirming the souls of the disciples, calling on them to continue in the faith and that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God.

23. And having hand-picked elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord into whom they believed.

24. And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

25. And speaking the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.

26. And from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

27. And having arrived, and gathering the church they related all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the nations.

28. And they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.  

## Acts 15

1. And certain ones who came down from Judea taught the brothers, saying, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.

2. Therefore dissension and not a little disputation occurring by Paul and Barnabas, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.

3. And indeed being set forward by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations. And they caused great joy to all the brothers.

4. And arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and elders. And they declared all things that God had done with them.

5. But some of those from the sect of the Pharisees, having believed, rose up, saying, It was necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses.   

6. And the apostles and elders were assembled to see about this matter.

7. And after much disputing, Peter rose up and said to them, Men, brothers, you recognize that from ancient days God chose among us that through my mouth the nations should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

8. And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit even as to us.

9. And He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

10. Now therefore why do you tempt God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

11. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, according to which manner they also believed.

12. And all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the nations through them.

13. And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.

14. Even as Simon has declared how God at the first visited the nations to take out of them a people for His name.

15. And the words of the prophets agree to this; as it is written,

16. "After this I will return and will build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up,

17. so those men who are left might seek after the Lord, and all the nations on whom My name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things."

18. All His works are known to God from eternity.

19. Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those who have turned to God from among the nations,

20. but that we write to them that they should abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.

21. For Moses from ages past has those in every city proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.   

22. Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas, whose last name was Barsabas; and Silas, chief men among the brothers.

23. And they wrote these things by their hand: The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers, from the nations in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

24. Because we have heard that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, Be circumcised and keep the law! (to whom we gave no such command);

25. it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also announce to you the same things by word.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things:

29. that you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which, if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Be prospered.

30. Then indeed they being let go, they came to Antioch. And gathering the multitude, they delivered the letter.

31. And when they had read it, they rejoiced at the comfort.

32. And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words and confirmed them.

33. And remaining for a time, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.

34. But it pleased Silas to remain there.

35. Also Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the gospel, the Word of the Lord, with many others also.   

36. And some days afterward, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have announced the Word of the Lord, how they are doing.

37. And Barnabas determined to take with them John, he being called Mark.

38. But Paul thought it well not to take that one with them, he having withdrawn form them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.

39. Then there was sharp feeling, as to separate them from each other. And taking Mark, Barnabas sailed to Cyprus.

40. But choosing Silas, Paul went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God,

41. passing through Syria and Cilicia, making the churches strong.  

## Acts 16

1. And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a woman who was a Jewess and who believed. But his father was a Greek.

2.  He was well reported of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.

3. Paul wanted him to go with him, and taking him he circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

4. And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the commandments to keep, the ones that were ordained by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.

5. Then indeed the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.   

6. And coming through the Phrygian and the Galatian region; and by the Holy Spirit being forbidden to speak the Word in Asia;

7. having come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia. But the Spirit did not allow them.

8. Then passing by Mysia, they came down into Troas.

9. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain man of Macedonia stood, begging him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us!

10. And after he saw the vision, we immediately tried to go into Macedonia, gathering that the Lord had called us in order to preach the gospel to them.

11. Then having set sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;

12. and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we continued spending time in that city some days.

13. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was usually made. And we sat down and spoke to the women who came together there.

14. And a certain woman named Lydia heard us, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God; whose heart the Lord opened, so that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.

15. And when she was baptized, she and her household, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. And she constrained us.   

16. And as we went to prayer, it happened that a certain girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining.

17. The same followed Paul and us and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who are announcing to us the way of salvation.

18. And she did this many days. But being distressed, and turning to the demonic spirit, Paul said, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! And it came out in that hour.

19. And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain went out, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged them to the market before the rulers.

20. And bringing them near to the judges, they said, These men, being Jews, are exceedingly troubling our city.

21. And they teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.

22. And the crowd rose up against them. And tearing off their clothes, the judges ordered them to be flogged.

23. And after laying on them many stripes, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailor to keep them safely;

24. who, having received such a command, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.   

25. And toward midnight Paul and Silas prayed and praised to God in a hymn. And the prisoners listened to them.

26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were loosened.

27. And being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison being open, drawing a sword, the jailer was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

28. But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.

29. Then asking for a light he rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.

30. And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and your household.

32. And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his household.

33. And taking them in that hour of the night, he washed from their stripes. And he was baptized, he and all his, immediately.

34. And bringing them up to the house, he set a table before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.   

35. And day coming, the judges sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.

36. And the jailer spoke these words to Paul: The judges have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, men who are Romans and uncondemned, they threw us into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! But coming themselves, let them bring us out.

38. And the floggers reported these words to the judges. And hearing that they were Romans, they were afraid.

39. And coming they begged them. And bringing them out, they asked them to depart out of the city.

40. And going out from the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia. And seeing the brothers, they comforted them and departed.  

## Acts 17

1. And traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them and reasoned with them out of the Scriptures on three sabbaths,

3. opening and setting forth that Christ must have suffered, and to have risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is Christ.

4. And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, both a great multitude of the worshiping Greeks, and not a few of the chief women.

5. But the disobeying Jews becoming jealous, and having taken aside some wicked men of the market-loafers, and gathering a crowd, they set all the city in an uproar. And coming on the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the mob.

6. And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brothers before the city judges, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here too,

7. whom Jason has received. And these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.

8. And hearing these things, they troubled the crowd and the city judge.

9. And taking security from Jason and from the rest, they let them go.   

10. And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. They, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. And these were more noble than those of Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily to see if those things were so.

12. Therefore many of them believed, and quite a few of honorable Greek women and men.

13. But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.

14. And then immediately the brothers sent Paul away to go towards the sea, but both Silas and Timothy stayed there.

15. And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.   

16. But awaiting them in Athens, Paul's spirit was pained within him, seeing city full of idols.

17. Then indeed he addressed the Jews in the synagogue, and those worshiping, and daily in the market, to those happening to be there.

18. And certain philosophers from the Epicureans and from the Stoics met him. And some said, What will this babbler say? And others said, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons (because he preached Jesus and the resurrection to them).

19. And taking hold of him, they led him to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know what is this new doctrine of which you speak?

20. For you bring certain strange things to our ears, therefore we are minded to know what these things mean.

21. (For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else except to tell or to hear something newer.)   

22. And standing in the middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Men, Athenians, I see that you are fearful of gods in everything.

23. For as I passed by and saw the things you worship, I also found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you.

24. The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.

25. Nor is served with men's hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives life and breath and all things to all.

26. And He has made all nations of men of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth, ordaining fore-appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling,

27. to seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after Him and find Him, though indeed He is not far from each one of us.

28. For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also certain of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.

29. Then being offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, engraved by art and man's imagination.

30. Truly, then, God overlooking the times of ignorance, now He strictly commands all men everywhere to repent,

31. because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He appointed, having given proof to all by raising Him from the dead.   

32. And hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked; and others said, We will hear you again concerning this.

33. And so Paul departed from among them.

34. But certain men joined themselves to him and believed; among whom were Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.  

## Acts 18

1. And after these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.

2. And finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) Paul came to them.

3. And because he was of the same trade, he stayed and worked with them; for they were tentmakers by occupation.

4. And he reasoned in the synagogue on every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.

5. And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

6. And they resisting and blaspheming, shaking his garment, he said to them, Your blood is on your own heads. I am pure from it. From now on I will go to the nations.   

7. And he departed from there and entered into the house of one named Justus, one worshiping God, whose house was next to the synagogue.

8. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house. And hearing this, many of the Corinthians believed and were baptized.

9. And the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and be not silent.

10. For I am with you, and no one shall set on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.

11. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.   

12. But Gallio being pro-consul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rushed against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,

13. saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the Law.

14. And Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed then, it was anything wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, according to reason I would endure you.

15. But if it is a question of a word and names, and of your law, you look to it. For I do not wish to be a judge of such things.

16. And he drove them from the judgment seat.

17. And all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio did not care for any of these things.   

18. And Paul having remained many days more, taking leave of the brothers, he sailed from there into Syria. And Priscilla and Aquila were with him. And Paul had shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.

19. And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

20. And they asking him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent

21. but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that is coming in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.

22. And when he had landed at Caesarea and had gone up to greet the church, he went down to Antioch.

23. And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.   

24. And a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.

25. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught the things of the Lord diligently, knowing only the baptism of John.

26. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla heard him, and they took him and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.

27. And intending to pass into Achaia, being encouraged, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him; who, having arrived, very much helped those who had believed through grace.

28. For he mightily confuted the Jews publicly, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.  

## Acts 19

1. And it happened in the time Apollos was at Corinth, Paul was passing through the higher parts to Ephesus. And finding certain disciples,

2. he said to them, Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? And they said to him, We did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit is.

3. And he said to them, Then to what were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism.

4. And Paul said, John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe into Him coming after him, that is, into Jesus Christ.

5. And hearing, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And as Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

7. And all of the men were about twelve.   

8. And going into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.

9. But when some were hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

10. And this happened over two years, so that all those living in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

11. And God did works of power through the hands of Paul,

12. so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin being brought onto the sick, the diseases were released, and the evil spirits went out of them.   

13. And certain from the strolling Jews, exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.

14. And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.

15. But answering the evil spirit said, Jesus I know, and I comprehend Paul, but who are you?

16. And the man in whom the evil spirit resided leaped on them, and overcoming them he was strong against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.

17. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks who lived at Ephesus, and fear fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. And many who believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.

19. Also many of those practicing the curious arts, bringing together the books, burned them before all. And they counted the prices of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. So the Word of God grew mightily and prevailed.   

21. After these things were ended, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have come there, I must also see Rome.

22. And sending into Macedonia two who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he stayed in Asia for a time.

23. And about that time there was no little a stir about the Way.

24. For a certain silversmith named Demetrius was making silver temples of Artemis, providing not a little trade for the craftsmen.

25. And assembling the workmen about such things, he said, Men, you know that from this trade is our wealth.

26. And you see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, he has perverted a huge crowd, saying that those which are made with hands are no gods.

27. And not only is this dangerous to us, our share coming into dispute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted for nothing, and her magnificence is also about to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.

28. And hearing, and becoming full of anger, they cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.

29. And all the city was filled with confusion. And they rushed with one accord to the theater, keeping a firm grip on Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.

30. And Paul intending to go in to the mob, the disciples did not allow him.

31. And some of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, begging him not to give himself into the theater.

32. Then indeed others cried out, some other things; for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.

33. And they dragged Alexander forward out of the crowd, the Jews thrusting him forward. And waving his hand Alexander desired to defend himself to the mob.

34. But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for two hours' time, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!

35. And quieting the crowd, the town clerk said, Men, Ephesians! What one of you does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Artemis, and of That Fallen from the Sky?

36. Since these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.

37. For you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of churches nor blasphemers of your goddess.

38. Therefore if Demetrius and those craftsmen with him truly have a matter against anyone, the court days are kept, and there are proconsuls. Let them plead against one another.

39. But if you ask anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.

40. For we are in danger to be accused of revolt concerning today; there being no cause by which we may give an account of this crowding together.

41. And saying these things, he dismissed the assembly.  

## Acts 20

1. And after the uproar had ceased, calling the disciples and greeting them, Paul left to go into Macedonia.

2. And passing through those parts, and exhorting them with much speech, he came into Greece.

3. And spending three months there, there being a plot against him by the Jews, being about to sail into Syria, he proposed to return through Macedonia.

4. And Sopater of Berea accompanied him into Asia, and Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus as far as Asia.

5. Going before, these waited for us at Troas.

6. And after the days of Unleavened Bread, we sailed away from Philippi and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.   

7. And on the first of the week, the disciples having been assembled to break bread, being about to depart on the morrow, Paul reasoned to them. And he continued his speech until midnight.

8. And there were many lights in the upper room where they were assembled.

9. And a certain young man named Eutychus was sitting on the window sill, Paul reasoning for a longer time, being overborne by sleep, he fell down from the third floor, and was taken up dead.

10. And Paul went down and fell on him, and embracing him said, Do not be terrified, for his soul is in him.

11. And going up, and breaking bread, and tasting, and conversing over a long time, until daybreak, he went out thus.

12. And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.   

13. And going ahead onto the ship, we sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.

14. And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.

15. And we sailed from there and came the next day across from Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos, and we stayed at Trogyllium. And the next day we came to Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not lose time in Asia; for, if it were possible for him, he hastened to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.   

17. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.

18. And when they had come to him, he said to them, You know how I was with you at all times, from the first day I arrived in Asia,

19. serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and many tears and temptations happening to me through the plots of the Jews;

20.  and how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but have shown you and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,

21. testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, behold, I am going bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall happen to me there,

23. except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus Christ, to testify fully the gospel of the grace of God.

25. And now, behold, I know that you all will see my face no more, among whom I went proclaiming the kingdom of God.

26. Therefore I testify to you on this day that I am pure from the blood of all.

27. For I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.

28. Therefore take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God which He has purchased with His own blood.

29. For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

30. Also men shall arise from your own selves, speaking perverse things in order to draw disciples away after them.

31. Therefore watch and remember that for the time of three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.

32. And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

33. I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.

34. Yea, you yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to those who were with me.

35. I have shown you all things, that working in this way we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.   

36. And saying these things, kneeling, he prayed with them all.

37. And there was much weeping of all, and falling on the neck of Paul, they ardently kissed him,

38. grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they went with him to the ship.  

## Acts 21

1. And it happened when it was time to sail, we having been torn away from them, running direct we came to Cos; and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.

2. And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, going on board, we set sail.

3. And sighting Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed into Syria, and came down to Tyre. For the ship was to unload its cargo there.

4. And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days; who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

5. But when it was time to finish the days, going out, we traveled on. And they with all the women and children went with us as far as outside the city. And we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.

6. And giving parting greetings to one another, we went up into the ship; and they returned to their own things.

7. And finishing the voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais. And greeting the brothers, we stayed with them one day.   

8. And the next day those around him going out, Paul came to Caesarea. And entering the house of Philip the evangelist, he being of the seven, we stayed with him.

9. And there were four virgin daughters to this one, who prophesied.

10. And as we stayed more days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.

11. And coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, and binding his hands and feet, he said, The Holy Spirit says these things: So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the hands of the nations.

12. And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And he not being persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.   

15. And after those days, making ready, we went up to Jerusalem.

16. Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing Mnason, a certain Cypriot, an old disciple with whom we were to lodge.

17. And we being in Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.

18. And on the next day Paul went with us to James. And all the elders were present.

19. And having greeted them, he related one by one what things God had done among the nations by his ministry.

20. And hearing, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe, and they are all zealous of the law.

21. And they are informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the nations to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the customs.

22. What is it therefore? At all events a multitude will come together, for they will hear that you have come.

23. Therefore do this, what we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;

24. taking them, be purified with them, and be at expense for them, so that they may shave their heads. And all may know that what they have been told about you is nothing, but you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.

25. And as to the nations who believe, we joined in writing, judging them to observe no such things, except only that they keep themselves from both idol sacrifice, and blood, and a thing strangled, and from fornication.

26. Then taking the men on the next day, being purified with them, Paul went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification, until an offering should be offered for each of them.   

27. And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews who were from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,

28. crying out, Men, Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people and the Law and this place. And even he brought Greeks into the temple and has polluted this holy place.

29. (For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city before, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

30. And all the city was moved, and the people ran together. And laying hands on Paul, they drew him outside of the temple. And immediately the doors were shut.

31. And as they were seeking to kill him, the news came to the chiliarch of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

32.  He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, they quit beating Paul.

33. Then going near, the chiliarch laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. And he demanded who he was and what he had done.

34. And others cried something else in the crowd, and not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.

35. And when he came on the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.

36. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him!

37. And as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say a thing to you? And he said, Do you know Greek?

38. Then are you not the Egyptian who before these days caused a riot, and led four thousand men of the assassins out into the wilderness?

39. But Paul said, I am a man, a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no small city. And I beseech you, allow me to speak to the people.

40. And he allowing him, standing on the stairs, Paul signaled with his hand to the people. And much silence taking place, he spoke in the Hebrew dialect, saying:  

## Acts 22

1. Men, brothers and fathers! Hear my defense now to you.

2. And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they all the more kept silence. And he said,   

3. I am truly a man, a Jew born in Tarsus in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the exactness of the law of the fathers, being a zealous one of God, as you all are today.

4.  I persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons;

5. as also the high priest bears witness to me, and all the elderhood. And receiving letters from them to the brothers, I traveled into Damascus indeed to lead those being bound to Jerusalem, in order that they might be punished.

6. And it happened to me, traveling and drawing near to Damascus: suddenly, about midday, a great light out of the heaven shone around me.

7. And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?

8. And I answered, Who are you, lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.

9. And they who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid. But they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.

10. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus. And there it shall be told you all things which are appointed for you to do.

11. And I did not see, because of the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.

12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, testified to by all the Jews who lived there,

13. coming to me and standing by, said to me, Brother Saul, look up! And the same hour I looked up on him.

14. And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice out of His mouth.

15. For you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.

16. And now what do you intend? Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

17. And it happened to me, I returning to Jerusalem and praying in the temple, I became in an ecstasy.

18. And I saw Him say to me, Hurry and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.

19. And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed on You throughout the synagogues.

20. And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was poured out, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and holding the garments of those who killed him.

21. And He said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the nations.   

22. And they listened to him until this word, and then they lifted up their voice, saying, Take such a one from the earth! For it is not fitting that he should live.

23. And as they shouted and tore their garments, and threw dust into the air,

24. the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying for him to be examined by scourging, so that he might know why they cried out so against him.

25. And as they stretched him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?

26. And hearing, coming near the centurion reported to the chiliarch, saying, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.

27. And coming up the chiliarch said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And He said, Yes.

28. And the chiliarch answered, With a great sum I bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born free.

29. Then immediately, those being about to examine him stood away from him. And the chiliarch also was afraid, fully knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.

30. On the next day, he desiring to know with certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to appear. And bringing Paul down, he set him among them.  

## Acts 23

1. And looking earnestly on the sanhedrin, Paul said, Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

2. And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, God shall strike you, whitened wall! For do you sit judging me according to the Law, and against law command me to be stricken?

4. And they who stood by him said, Do you revile God's high priest?

5. Then Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written, "You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people."   

6. But when Paul saw that the one part were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrin, Men! Brothers! I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I am being judged because of the hope and resurrection of the dead.

7. And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.

8. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.

9. And there arose a great cry. And the scribes who were on the Pharisees' side arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.

10. And dissension arising, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him from among them by force, and to bring him into the fortress.

11. And the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you also must bear witness at Rome.   

12. And when it became day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

13. And they who made this conspiracy were more than forty.

14. And they came to the chief priests and elders and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.

15. Now therefore you, with the sanhedrin, inform the chiliarch that he bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly regarding him. And we are ready to put him to death before he comes near.

16. And hearing of the ambush, Paul's sister's son, having come near, and entering into the fortress, he reported to Paul.

17. And calling one of the centurions, Paul said, Bring this young man to the chiliarch, for he has a certain thing to tell him.

18. So he took him and brought him to the chiliarch and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.

19. And laying hold of his hand, and drawing aside privately, the chiliarch asked him, What is it that you have to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they would inquire something more exactly about him.

21. But do not yield to them, for there are more than forty men of them lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, looking for a promise from you.

22. So the chiliarch sent away the young man commanding, Tell no one that you have shown these things to me.

23. And he called two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night.

24. And provide animals, so that they may set Paul on them and bring him to Felix the governor.

25. And he wrote a letter in this way:

26. Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.

27. This man was taken by the Jews and would have been killed by them. Then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.

28. And being minded to know the charge for which they accused him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin;

29. whom I found be accused of questions of their law, and having no charge worthy of death or of bonds.

30. And it being revealed to me that a plot against the man was about to be executed by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell.

31. Then, indeed, taking up Paul, as it was commanded them, the soldiers brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. And on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress.

33. And when they had come to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul before him also.

34. And when the governor had read the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,

35. he said, I will hear you when your accusers have also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.  

## Acts 24

1. And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator, Tertullus, who made a statement to the governor against Paul.

2. And being called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,

3. Since we enjoy great quietness by you, and very worthy deeds are done to this nation due to your forethought, in everything and everywhere, most noble Felix, we accept with all thankfulness.

4. But that I not hinder you further, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your fairness.

5. For we have found this man pestilent, and moving rebellion among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,

6. who also attempted to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law.

7. But the chiliarch Lysias came with much force, taking him away out of our hands,

8. commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him, you yourself may know about all these things of which we accuse him.

9. And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.   

10. But the governor motioning to him to speak, Paul answered; Understanding you as being a judge of this nation many years, I cheerfully defend myself as to the things concerning myself.

11. You can know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

12. And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, nor making a gathering of a crowd; not even in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.

13. Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.

14. But I confess this to you, that after the Way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.

15. And I have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

16. And in this I exercise myself, always to have a blameless conscience toward God and men.

17. And after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation.

18. Among which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with tumult.

19. These ought to be present before you and to accuse me, if they have anything against me.

20. Or else let these themselves say if they have found anything unjust in me while I stood before the sanhedrin,

21. unless it may be for this one voice that I cried out standing among them, that concerning a resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.   

22. And having heard these things, Felix put them off, knowing more accurately of the Way, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch has come down, I will examine the things concerning you.

23. And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and not to forbid anyone of his own to minister or come to him.

24. Then after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

25. And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the Judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go for this time, but taking time later, I will call for you.

26. He also hoped that silver would be given him by Paul, that he might free him. Therefore he also frequently sent for him and talked with him.

27. But after two years Felix welcomed a successor, Porcius Festus. And wishing to show a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.  

## Acts 25

1. Then entering the province, after three days Festus went from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

2. And the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him

3. asking a favor against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on way.

4. Then indeed Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea; he himself would depart shortly.

5. Then he said, those having power among you may go down with me. If there is a thing amiss in this man, let them accuse him.

6. And staying among them more than ten days, going down to Caesarea, on the next day sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.

7. And he having come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many charges against Paul, which they could not prove.

8. Defending himself, Paul said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything.

9. But Festus, wanting to please the Jews, answered Paul and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me about these things?

10. But Paul said, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.

11. For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing of which these accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.

12. Then conferring with the sanhedrin, Festus answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.   

13. And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.

14. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, A certain man has been left in bonds by Felix,

15. about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring judgment against him.

16. To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before he being accused may have the accusers face to face, and have had freedom to answer for himself concerning the accusation.

17. Therefore, when they had come here, without any delay I sat on the judgment seat the next day and commanded the man to be brought,

18. about whom, standing up, the accusers brought against him no charge of which I suspected,

19. but they had certain questions about their own demon-worship, and about a certain Jesus dying, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

20. And because I was perplexed about this question, I asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.

21. But Paul having appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be held until I might send him to Caesar.

22. And Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. And he said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.

23. And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered into the auditorium with both the chiliarchs and principal men of the city, also Festus commanding, Paul was brought out.

24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those men present with us, you see this one about whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

25. But I had perceived nothing he had committed worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I determined to send him,

26. about whom I have no certain thing to write of him to my lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, so that, after examination is made, I might have something to write.

27. For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the charges against him.  

## Acts 26

1. And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then stretching out his hand, Paul made a defense:

2. Concerning all of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I think myself happy being about to make defense before you today,

3. you being especially expert in all customs and questions among the Jews. Therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.

4. Truly, then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, which was at first among my own nation at Jerusalem,

5. who knew me from the first, if they would testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made to our fathers by God,

7. to which promise our twelve tribes hope to attain, serving God fervently night and day. For the sake of this hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.

8. Why is it thought a thing incredible with you that God raises the dead?

9. I truly thought within myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,

10. which I also did in Jerusalem. And I shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And they being put to death, I cast a vote.

11. And I punished them often in every synagogue; I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly furious against them, I persecuted them even to the outside cities.   

12. In which pursuit also traveling to Damascus with authority and power of decision from the chief priests,

13. at midday, along the highway, O king, I and those with me saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun; shining around me.

14. And all of us falling to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.

15. And I said, Who are you, lord? And He said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.

16. But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of what you saw, and in what I shall appear to you;

17. delivering you from the people and the nations, to whom I now send you

18. in order to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, so that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.

19. After this, king Agrippa, I did not disobey the heavenly vision.

20. But to those first in Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the country of Judea, and to the nations, I made known the command to repent and to turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance

21. Because of these things, having caught me in the temple, The Jews tried to kill me.

22. Then having obtained help from God, I stand until this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said was going to happen;

23. that Christ should suffer, that by a resurrection of the dead, He would be the first, going to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.   

24. And he defending himself with these things, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you rave! Your many letters turn you to insanity.

25. But he said, Not to insanity, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and sanity.

26. For the king understands about these things, to whom I speak, even being bold of speech. For I am persuaded that not any of these things are hidden from him, nothing. For the doing of this was not in a corner.

27. King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.

28. And Agrippa said to Paul, Do you persuade me to be a Christian in but a little?

29. And Paul said, I would pray to God, both in a little and in much, that not only you, but also all hearing me today to become as I also am, except for these bonds.

30. And he having spoken this, the king and the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them rose up.

31. And withdrawing, they spoke with one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

32. And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar.  

## Acts 27

1. And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' cohort.

2. And boarding a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail alongside Asian places, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, being with us.

3. And on the next day we were landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul courteously and gave him liberty to go to his friends to receive care.

4. And setting sail from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

5. And sailing over the sea against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.

6. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.

7. And sailing slowly many days and with difficulty, coming abreast of Cnidus; the wind not allowing us; we sailed close to Crete, across from Salmone.

8. And coasting along with difficulty, we came to a place named Fair Havens, near which was a city, Lasea.

9. And much time having been used up, and the voyage already being dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul warned them,

10. saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage is about to be with much harm and loss, and not only much cargo and of the ship, but also of our souls.

11. But the centurion was rather persuaded by the helmsman and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.   

12. And the port not being fit to winter in, the most of them advised to set sail from there, if by any means they might be able to get to Phoenix to winter; which is a port of Crete, looking toward the southwest and northwest.

13. And a south wind blowing softly, thinking to have obtained their purpose, lifting anchor, they sailed along close beside Crete.

14. But not long after, a stormy wind called Euroclydon beat down on it.

15. And the ship being seized, and not being able to beat against the wind, giving way we were borne along.

16. And running under an islet being called Clauda, we hardly were able to become masters of the boat;

17. which taking, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the sandbanks of Syrtis, lowering the tackle, so they were borne along.

18. And being exceedingly storm-tossed with a tempest, they made a casting on the next day;

19. And on the third day we threw out the ship's tackle with our hands.

20. And neither sun nor stars appearing in many days, and no small tempest pressing hard, now all hope that we would be saved was taken away.   

21. But there being much fasting, then standing up in their midst, Paul said, O men, being obedient to me you ought not to have set sail from Crete, and to have come by this harm and loss.

22. And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there will be no casting away of life among you, only of the ship.

23. For tonight an angel of God stood beside me, whose I am and whom I serve,

24. saying, Fear not, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And behold! God has given you all those who sail with you.

25. Therefore, men, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it will be so, according to the way it was told me.

26. But we must fall on a certain island.

27. But when the fourteenth night came, we being carried about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they drew near some country.

28. And sounding they found it twenty fathoms; and moving a little further, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms.

29. And fearing that we would fall on rocks, and casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished day to come.

30. But the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, pretending to be about to cast out anchors from the prow,

31. Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall.

33. And until day was about to come, Paul begged all to take food, saying, This is the fourteenth day that you continued waiting without food, having taken nothing.

34. Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your deliverance. For not a hair of your head shall perish.

35. And saying these things, and taking bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and breaking, he began to eat.

36. And all becoming cheered, they also took food.

37. And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.

38. And being filled with food, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea.

39. And when day came, they did not recognize the land. But they discovered a certain bay with a beach, into which they were minded, if they were able, to drive the ship.

40. And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea; at the same time they loosened the rudder bands and hoisted up the foresail to the wind and held to the shore.

41. And coming on a place between two seas, they drove the vessel. And indeed the prow sticking fast, it remained unmovable. But the stern was broken with the violence of the waves.

42. And the mind of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.

43. But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from their purpose and commanded those who could swim, to throw themselves overboard, to go out on the land.

44. And the rest went, some on boards and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were saved on the land.  

## Acts 28

1. And being saved, then they knew that the island was called Melita.

2. And the foreigners showed us not the common kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed all of us, because of the rain coming on, and because of the cold.

3. And Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.

4. And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, being saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed to live.

5. Then indeed he shook off the creature into the fire, suffering no harm.

6. But they expected him to be about to become inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly, But over much time expecting and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

7. In the quarters about that place were lands to the chief of the island, whose name was Publius. Welcoming us, he lodged us courteously three days.

8. And it happened the father of Publius was lying down, suffering fevers and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and praying and laying on his hands, he healed him.

9. Then this taking place, the rest who were having infirmities in the island also came, and were healed.

10.  They also honored us with many honors. And on our setting sail, they laid on the things of our needs.   

11. And after three months we sailed in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian with an ensign, The Twin Brothers.

12. And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.

13. Going around from there we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind coming on, we came to Puteoli on the second,

14. where finding brothers, we were asked to stay seven days. And so we went toward Rome.

15. And the brothers from there hearing of us, they came to meet us as far as the market-place of Appius, and Three Taverns. Seeing them, thanking God, Paul took courage.

16. And when we came into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the camp commander. But Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with a soldier guarding him.   

17. And after three days it happened that Paul called together those being chief of the Jews. And they coming together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I did nothing against the people or customs of our fathers. I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans

18. who, examining me, were of a mind to let me go because there was no cause of death in me.

19. But the Jews speaking against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not as having anything to accuse my nation.

20. For this cause, then, I called for you, to see and to speak with you. For I have this chain around me for the hope of Israel.

21. And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came declared or spoke anything evil of you.

22. But we think it right to hear from you what you think. For truly as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.   

23. And they having appointed him a day, many came to him in his lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them the things concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.

24. And some indeed believed the things that were said, others did not believe.

25. And disagreeing with one another, they were let go, Paul saying one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,

26. saying, "Go to this people and say: Hearing you shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see and not perceive.

27. For the heart of this people was fattened, and they have heard with their ears dully; and they closed their eyes; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."

28. Therefore be it known to you that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will hear.

29. And he having said these words, the Jews departed, having much discussion amongst themselves.   

30. And Paul remained two years in his own hired house. And he welcomed all who came in to him,

31. proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, and without hindrance.
