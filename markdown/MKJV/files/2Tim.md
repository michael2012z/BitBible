# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

2. to Timothy, my dearly beloved child. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,

4. greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,

5. taking recollection of the unfeigned faith that is in you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice. And I am persuaded that it is in you also.   

6. Therefore I remind you to inflame anew the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.

7. For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

8. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner. But be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God,

9. who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the eternal times.

10. But it is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has made death of no effect, bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel;

11. to which I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the nations.

12. For this cause I also suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him against that Day.

13. Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

14. Guard the good Deposit given through the Holy Spirit indwelling in us.   

15. This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.

17. But when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.

18. May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day. And in what things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.  

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

2. And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

3. Therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

4. No one who wars tangles with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who chose him to be a soldier.

5. And also if anyone competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.

6. It is right for the laboring farmer to partake first of the fruits.

7. Consider what I say, and the Lord will give you understanding in all things.   

8. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel,

9. in which I suffer ill as an evildoer, even to bonds. But the Word of God is not chained.

10. Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

11. Faithful is the word, for if we are dead with Him, we shall also live with Him.

12. If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us.

13. If we do not believe Him, yet He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.   

14. Put them in memory of these things, charging them before the Lord not to dispute about words to no profit, to the subverting of the hearers.

15.  Study earnestly to present yourself approved to God, a workman that does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

16. But shun profane, vain babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness.

17. And their word will eat like a gangrene; among whom are Hymeneus and Philetus,

18. who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and who overthrow the faith of some.   

19. Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal: " The Lord knew those who are His." And, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity!"

20. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.

21. Therefore if anyone purges himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.   

22. But flee youthful lusts, and follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

23. But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they give birth to strifes.

24. But the servant of the Lord must not strive, but to be gentle to all, apt to teach, patient,

25. in meekness instructing those who oppose, if perhaps God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth,

26. and that they awake out of the snare of the Devil, having been taken captive by him, so as to do the will of that one.  

## 2 Timothy 3

1. Know this also, that in the last days grievous times will be on us.

2. For men will be self-lovers, money-lovers, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3. without natural affection, unyielding, false accusers, without self-control, savage, despisers of good,

4. traitors, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

5. having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these.

6. For of these are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women loaded with sins, led away with different kinds of lusts,

7. ever learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.

8. But as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so these also resist the truth, men of corrupt mind, reprobate concerning the faith.

9. But they shall proceed no further. For their foolishness shall be plain to all, as theirs also became.   

10. But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,

11. persecutions, afflictions, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. What persecutions I endured! But the Lord delivered me out of all.

12. Yea, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

13. But evil men and seducers will go forward to worse, deceiving and being deceived.

14. But continue in the things that you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,

15. and that from a babe you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

16. All Scripture is God-breathed, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,

17. that the man of God may be perfected, thoroughly furnished to every good work.  

## 2 Timothy 4

1. Therefore I solemnly witness before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is going to judge the living and the dead according to His appearance and His kingdom,

2. preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.

3. For the time will be when they will not endure sound doctrine, but they will heap up teachers to themselves according to their own lusts, tickling the ear.

4. And they will turn away their ears from the truth and will be turned to myths.

5. But you watch in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fully carry out your ministry."

6. For I am already being poured out, and the time of my release is here.

7. I have fought a good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.

8. Now there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that Day; and not to me only, but also to all those who love His appearing.   

9. Make haste to come to me quickly.

10. For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and he has departed to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

11. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

12. And I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

13. When you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith showed many evil things to me. The Lord will give to him according to his works.

15. You also should beware of him, for he has greatly withstood our words.   

16. At my first answer no one was beside me, but all deserted me. May it not be laid to their charge.

17. But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that through me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the nations might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

18. And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for His heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

19. Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus stayed at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.

21. Try to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.

22. May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
