16. And David was then in the stronghold, and the Philistines garrison was then at Bethlehem.

18. And the three broke through the Philistine army and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David. But David would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD.

19. And he said, May my God forbid me to do this thing. Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in danger? For they brought it with their lives. And he was not willing to drink it. These three mighty ones did these things.

20. And Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the three. For lifting up his spear against three hundred, he killed them, and had a name among the three.

21. Of the three, he was more honorable than the two for he was their captain. However, he did not attain the first three.

23. And he killed an Egyptian, a man of stature, five cubits high. And in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam. And he went down to him with a staff and wrenched the spear out of the Egyptians hand, and killed him with his own spear.

24. These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had the name among the three mighty ones.

18. And the Spirit came on Amasai, chief of the Thirty. And he said, We are yours, David, and on your side, son of Jesse. Peace, peace be on you, and peace on your helpers. For your God has helped you. And David received them and made them captains of the band.

19. And some from Manasseh fell to David when he came with the Philistines to battle against Saul. (But they did not help them. For the lords of the Philistines sent him away on advice, saying, He will fall to his master Saul with our heads.)

20. As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him these from Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands who were from Manasseh.

21. And they helped David against the band, for they were all mighty men of power, and were commanders in the army.

13. And the Philistines still again made a raid in the valley.

12. And he said to them, You are the heads of the fathers of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place which I have prepared for it.

## 1 Chronicles 16

2. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.

3. And he divided to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread and a portion, and a raisin cake.

4. And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:

5. Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom. And Jeiel praised with instruments of harps and with lyres; and Asaph made a sound with cymbals.

6. Also Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests praised with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.   

7. Then on that day David first delivered this psalm into the hand of Asaph and his brothers in order to thank the LORD:

8. Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name, make known His deeds among the people.

9. Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him, talk of all His wondrous works.

10. Glory in His holy name, let the heart of those who seek the LORD rejoice.

11. Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.

12. Remember His marvelous works which He had done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,

13. O seed of Israel His servant, sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.

14. He is the LORD our God. His judgments are in all the earth.

15. Be always mindful of His covenant, the word He commanded to a thousand generations,

16. which He made with Abraham, and of His oath to Isaac.

17. And He has confirmed the saying to Jacob for a law, to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

18. saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,

19. when you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it,

20. and they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people,

21. He did not allow any man to do them wrong. Yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,

22. saying, Touch not My anointed, and do My prophets no harm.

23. Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Show forth from day to day His salvation.

24. Declare His glory among the heathen, His marvelous works among all nations.

25. For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods.

26. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.

27. Glory and honor are in His presence, strength and gladness in His place.

28. Give to the LORD, O kindred of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.

29. Give to the LORD the glory of His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

30. Tremble before Him, all the earth. Yea, the earth is established, it shall not be moved.

31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. And let them say among the nations, The LORD reigns.

32. Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it. Let the fields rejoice, and all that is in them.

33. Then shall the trees of the forest sing out at the presence of the LORD, because He comes to judge the earth.

34. O give thanks to the LORD, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever.

35. And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us, and deliver us from the nations, so that we may give thanks to Your holy name, and glory in Your praise.

36. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel forever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.   

37. And he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, for Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;

38. also Obed-edom, with their brothers, sixty-eight; and Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be gatekeepers.

39. And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place at Gibeon,

40. to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the burnt offering morning and evening without end, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD which He commanded Israel.

41. And he left with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were called by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His mercy endures forever.

42. And with them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those making a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.

43. And all the people departed, each man to his house. And David returned to bless his house.  

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. And it happened as David sat in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under curtains.

2. And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.

3. And it happened the same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

4. Go and tell David My servant, So says the LORD, You shall not build Me a house to dwell in.

5. For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel until today, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.

6. Wherever I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedars?

7. And now you shall say this to My servant David, So says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, so that you should be ruler over My people Israel.

8. And I have been with you wherever you have walked, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men in the earth.

9. And I will set a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall live in their place and shall be moved no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,

10. and since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. And I declare to you that the LORD will build you a house.

11. And it will be, when your days have ended so that you must go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, who shall be from your sons. And I will make his kingdom sure.

12. He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.

13. I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. And I will not take My mercy away from him as I took it from him who was before you.

14. And I will settle him in My house, and in My kingdom forever. And his throne shall be established forever.

15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.   

16. And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O, LORD God, and what is my house, that You have brought me here?

17. And this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, for You have also spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.

18. What can David say more to You for the honor of Your servant? For You know Your servant!

19. O LORD, for Your servant's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.

20. O LORD, there is none like You, neither any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

21. And what one nation in the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be His own people, to make You a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You have redeemed out of Egypt?

22. And You have chosen Your people Israel for Yourself, for a people forever. And You, LORD, became their God.

23. And now, O LORD, let the thing which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have said.

24. Let it even be established, so that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, a God to Israel. And let the house of David Your servant be established before You.

25. For You, O my God, have told Your servant that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found in his heart to pray before You.

26. And now, LORD, You are God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant.

27. And now let it please You to bless the house of Your servant so that it may be before You forever. For You have blessed, O LORD, and it is blessed forever.

3. But the rulers of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Is David honoring your father in your eyes, because he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?

4. And Hanun took David's servants and shaved them, and cut off their garments in half, to the buttocks, and sent them away.

10. Go and speak to David, saying, So says the LORD: I offer you three things. Choose one of them so that I may do it to you.

11. And Gad came to David and said to him, So says the LORD, Choose for yourself:

12. either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtake you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even the plague in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the border of Israel. And now say what word I shall bring again to Him who sent me.

13. And David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Let me fall now into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great. But do not let me fall into the hand of man.

14. And the LORD sent a plague on Israel. And there fell seventy thousand men of Israel.

15. And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. And as he was destroying, the LORD looked. And He repented of the evil and said to the angel who destroyed, Enough! Stay your hand now! And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

16. And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.

17. And David said to God, Did not I command to number the people? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed. But these sheep, what have they done? I pray You, let Your hand be on me, O LORD my God, and on my father's house, but not on Your people, that they should be plagued.   

18. And the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

19. And David went up at the word of Gad which he spoke in the name of the LORD.

20. And Ornan turned back and saw the angel. And his four sons with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat.

21. And David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out of the threshing-floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.

22. Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, so that I may build an altar in it to the LORD. You shall give it to me for the full price, so that the plague may be stayed from the people.

23. And Ornan said to David, Take for yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. Lo, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the food offering. I give it all.

24. And king David said to Ornan, No, but I will truly buy it for the full silver. For I will not take what is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

25. And David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.

26. And David built an altar there to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the LORD. And He answered him from Heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.

27. And the LORD commanded the angel, and he put up his sword again into its sheath.

28. At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.

30. But David could not go before it to ask of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.  

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

2. And David commanded the strangers in the land of Israel to be gathered. And he set masons to cut squared stones to build the house of God.

3. And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings, and bronze in abundance without weight,

4. and also cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought in cedar trees in abundance to David.

5. And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house to be built for the LORD is to be highly magnificent, for a name and for beauty to all the lands. I will now prepare for it. And David prepared abundantly before his death.   

6. And he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.

7. And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.

8. But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed much blood and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to My name because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.

9. Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. And I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.

10. He shall build a house for My name. And he shall be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.

11. Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and bless you, and build the house of the LORD your God as He has said of you.

12. Only may the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and direct you concerning Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.

13. Then you shall prosper, if you take heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments with which the LORD charged Moses, concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage. Do not fear, nor be dismayed.

14. And, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and of bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance. I have prepared timber also, and stone, and you may add to them.

15. And there are many workmen with you, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of skillful men for every kind of work.

16. Of the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may the LORD be with you.   

17. And David commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,

18. Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the people of the land into my hand. And the land is humbled before the LORD and before His people.

19. Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Arise therefore and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.  

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. And David was old and full of days, and he made his son Solomon king over Israel.

2. And he gathered all the rulers of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

3. And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward. And their number by their heads, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.

4. Of these, twenty-four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD, and six thousand officers and judges.

5. And four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which David made for praising.

6. And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath and Merari.

7. Of the men of Gershon were Laadan and Shimei.

8. The sons of Laadan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.

9. The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

10. And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

11. And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons. Therefore they were in one roster, according to their father's house.

12. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was separated so that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to Him, and to bless in His name forever.

14. And as to Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

16. Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

17. And the sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

18. Of the sons of Izhar, Shelomith was the chief;

19. of the sons of Hebron, Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

20. Of the sons of Uzziel, Michah the first, and Jesiah the second.

21. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

22. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but had daughters. And their brothers, the sons of Kish, took them.

23. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.   

24. These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers, the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their heads, the ones who did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.

25. For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest to His people so that they may dwell in Jerusalem forever,

26. and also to the Levites, so that they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any of its vessels for its service.

27. For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above,

28. because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God

29. both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for food offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all kinds of measure and size,

30. and to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening.

31. And they were to offer all burnt sacrifices to the LORD in the sabbath, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD,

32. and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the Holy Place, and the charge of their brothers, the sons of Aaron, in the service of the house of the LORD.  

## 1 Chronicles 24

1. And the divisions of the sons of Aaron were: The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

2. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no sons. And Eleazar and Ithamar were priests.

3. And David distributed them according to their offices in their service, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar.

4. And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar. And so they were divided. Among the sons of Eleazar were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.

5. So they divided them by lot, one sort with another. For the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

6. And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the rulers, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites. One principal household was taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

7. Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

8. the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

9. the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

20. And the rest of the sons of Levi: Of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

4. But the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be the ruler, and of the house of Judah the house of my father. And in my father's house He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.

9. And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind. For the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you. But if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.

10. Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it.   

11. And David gave to his son Solomon the pattern of the porch, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of its upper rooms, and of its innermost rooms, and of the place of the mercy-seat,

12. and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the rooms all around the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the holy things;

21. And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites are for all the service of the house of God. And there shall be with you every willing skillful man for every kind of workmanship, for any kind of service. Also the rulers and all the people will be according to all your words.  

## 1 Chronicles 29

1. And David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and tender, and the work is great. For the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.

2.

4. three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;

5. the gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work by the hands of skillful workers. And who is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD?

6. And the chiefs of the fathers, and the rulers of the tribes of Israel, and the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly.

7. And they gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents of gold and ten thousand darics, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.

8. And he who had precious stones gave to the treasury of the house of the LORD by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

9. And the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.   

10. And David blessed the LORD before all the congregation. And David said, Blessed are You, LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever.

11. O LORD, Yours is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and, the majesty. For all in the heavens and in the earth is Yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and You lift up Yourself to all as Head.

12. And the riches and the honor are from You, and You reign over all. And in Your hand is power and might. And it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.

13. And now, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name.

14. But who am I, and who my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things are from You, and we have given to You that which is Yours.

15. For we are strangers before You, and pilgrims, as our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and none abides.

16. O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name comes from Your hand, and is all Your own.

17. I know also, my God, that You try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. I, in the uprightness of my heart, have willingly offered all these things. And now I have seen with joy Your people who are present here to offer willingly to You.

18. O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and prepare their heart to You.

19. And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the magnificent house for which I have made ready.

20. And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God! And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed and worshiped the LORD, and bowed to the king.

22. And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before the LORD as ruler, and Zadok to be as priest.   

23. And Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of David his father. And he was blessed, and all Israel obeyed him.

24. And all the rulers and the mighty men, and also all the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.

25. And the LORD made Solomon very great in the sight of all Israel, and placed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

27. And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
