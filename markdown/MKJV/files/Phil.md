# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.

2. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.   

3. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

4. always in every prayer of mine making my request for you all with joy

5. for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;

6. being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,   

7. even as it is righteous for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partakers of my grace.

8. For God is my witness how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.   

9. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and in all perception;

10. that you may distinguish between things that differ, that you may be sincere and without offense until the day of Jesus Christ,

11. being filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.   

12. But I desire that you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;

13. so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places.

14. And most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

15. Some indeed even preach Christ because of envy and strife, and some also of good will.

16. Those, indeed, preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.

17. But these others preach in love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.

18. What then? Nevertheless, in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached. And I rejoice in this. Yet, also I will rejoice.

19. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

20. according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but as always now Christ shall be magnified in my body with all boldness, whether it is by life or by death.   

21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

22. But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor. Yet I do not know what I shall choose.

23. For I am pressed together by the two: having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.

24. But to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.

25. And having this confidence, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your advancement and joy of faith,

26. so that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.   

27. Only let your conduct be as becomes the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you, or else am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel,

28. and terrified in nothing by your adversaries. For this is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

29. For to you it is given on behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake,

30. having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.  

## Philippians 2

1. If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tendernesses and mercies,

2. then fulfill my joy, that you may be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord and of one mind.

3.  Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves.

4. Do not let each man look upon his own things, but each man also on the things of others.

5. For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,

6. who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,

7. but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.

8. And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

9. Therefore God has highly exalted Him, and has given Him a name which is above every name,

10. that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly ones, and of earthly ones, and of ones under the earth;

11. and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.   

12. Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, cultivate your own salvation with fear and trembling.

13. For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.   

14. Do all things without murmurings and disputings,

15. so that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. Among these you shine as lights in the world,

16. holding forth the word of life, so that I may rejoice with you in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain nor labored in vain.

17. Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.

18. And you also rejoice in the same, and rejoice with me.

19. But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, so that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state.

20. For I have no one who is like-minded, who will naturally care for your state.

21. For all seek their own, not the things which are of Jesus Christ.

22. But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.

23. Therefore I hope to send him presently, as soon as I shall see the things about me.

24. But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.

25. Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and he who ministered to my wants.

26. For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness, because you had heard that he had been sick.

27. For indeed he was sick, coming near death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

28. Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, so that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

29. Therefore receive him in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in honor,

30. because for the work of Christ he was near death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.  

## Philippians 3

1. Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is indeed not grievous to me, but for you it is safe.

2. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision party.

3. For we are the circumcision who worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh;   

4. though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I more.

5. I was circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. As regards the Law, I was a Pharisee;

6. concerning zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in the Law, blameless.

7. But whatever things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

8. But no, rather, I also count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them to be dung, so that I may win Christ   

9. and be found in Him; not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but through the faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith,

10. that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death;

11. if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.

12. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I am pressing on, if I may lay hold of that for which I also was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.

13. My brothers, I do not count myself to have taken possession, but one thing I do, forgetting the things behind and reaching forward to the things before,

14. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.   

15. Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be of this mind. And if in anything you are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.

16. Yet, as to what we have already attained, let us walk in the same rule, let us mind the same thing.   

17. Brothers, be imitators together of me, and mark those who walk this way, for you have us for a pattern.

18. (For many are walking, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ;

19. whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, those who mind earthly things.)

20. For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which also we are looking for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,

21. who shall change our body of humiliation so that it may be fashioned like His glorious body, according to the working of His power, even to subdue all things to Himself.  

## Philippians 4

1. Therefore, my brothers, ones loved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand fast in this way in the Lord, beloved ones.

2. I beg Euodia and Syntyche that they be of the same mind in the Lord.

3. And I also beg you, true yoke-fellow, help those women who labored in the gospel with me and with Clement, and others of my fellow-laborers, whose names are in the Book of Life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, Rejoice!

5. Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.

6. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

7. And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

8. Finally, my brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, think on these things.

9. Do those things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me. And the God of peace shall be with you.   

10. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again. Although you indeed did think, but you lacked opportunity.

11. Not that I speak according to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.

12. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

13. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

14. Yet you did well in sharing my troubles.

15. Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as regards giving and receiving, except you alone.

16. For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.

17. I do not say this because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

18. But I have all, and abound. I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things which you sent, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God.

19. But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.   

20. Now unto God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.

21. Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.

22. All the saints greet you, most of all those who are of Caesar's household.

23. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
