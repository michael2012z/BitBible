# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ (according to the faith of God's elect, in the acknowledging of the truth which is according to godliness

2. on hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the eternal times,

3. but revealed in its own times in a proclamation of His word, with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior,)

4. to Titus, a true child according to our common faith. Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.   

5. For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you,   

6. if anyone is blameless, husband of one wife, having believing children, not accused of loose behavior, or disobedient.

7. For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not full of passion, not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy for ill gain;

8. but hospitable, a lover of good, discreet, just, holy, temperate

9. holding fast the faithful word according to the doctrine, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convict the gainsayers.

10. For there are indeed many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,

11. whose mouth you must stop, who subvert whole houses, teaching things not right for the sake of ill gain.

12. One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.

13. This witness is true; for which cause convict them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men, turning away from the truth.

15. To the pure all things are pure. But to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

16. They profess that they know God, but in their works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient and reprobate to every good work.  

## Titus 2

1. But you speak the things which become sound doctrine:

2. aged men to be temperate, sensible, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience.

3. Let the aged women likewise be in reverent behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved by much wine, teachers of good;

4. that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,

5.  to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be blasphemed.

6. Likewise exhort the young men to be discreet;

7. In all things having shown yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine, purity, sensibleness, without corruption,

8.  in sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

9. Slaves are to be obedient to their masters, to please them well in all things, not talking back,

10. not stealing, but showing all good faith, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.   

11. For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,

12. teaching us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live discreetly, righteously and godly, in this present world,

13. looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,

14. who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to Himself a special people, zealous of good works.   

15. Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.  

## Titus 3

1. Put them in mind to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to every good work,

2. to speak evil of no one, not being quarrelsome, but forbearing, showing all meekness to all men.

3. For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, slaving for various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.

4. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,

5. not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,

6. whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,

7. that being justified by His grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. Faithful is the Word, and as to these things, I desire that you strongly affirm that those believing God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.   

9. But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions, and strivings about the Law, for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. After the first and second warning, reject a man of heresy,

11. knowing that he who is such has been perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.

12. When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.

13. Diligently set forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, that nothing may be lacking to them.

14. And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, so that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with you all. Amen.
