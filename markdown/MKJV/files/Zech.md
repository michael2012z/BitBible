# Zechariah

## Zechariah 1

1. In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

2. The LORD has been very angry with your fathers.

3. And you say to them, So says the LORD of hosts: Turn to Me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, says the LORD of hosts.

4. Be not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have proclaimed to them, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: Turn now from your evil ways and your evil doings. But they did not hear nor listen to Me, says the LORD.

5. Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

6. But My words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so He has done with us.   

7. On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, it is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

8. I watched by night. And behold! a Man riding on a red horse, and He stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine. And behind Him were red, sorrel and white horses.

9. Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the angel who talked with me said to me, I will show you what these are.

10. And the Man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

11. And they answered the Angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sits still and is at peace.

12. Then the Angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah against which You have cursed these seventy years?

13. And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me with good words, comfortable words.

14. So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

15. And with great anger I am angry at the nations at ease; in that I was but a little angry, and they gave help for evil.

16. Therefore so says the LORD: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts. And a line shall be stretched over Jerusalem.

17. Cry out again, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall yet be spread abroad through good, and the LORD shall again overflow with goodness, and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.   

18. Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, four horns!

19. And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

20. And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.

21. And I said, What are these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.  

## Zechariah 2

1. I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold! A man with a measuring line in his hand.

2. Then I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.

3. And behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him.

4. And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited, as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in her midst.

5. And I, says the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire all around, and will be the glory in her midst.   

6. Ho! Ho! Flee then from the land of the north, says the LORD. For I have scattered you as the four winds of the heavens, says the LORD.

7. Ho! O Zion, escape, you who live with the daughter of Babylon.

8. For so says the LORD of hosts: He has sent me after glory, to the nations who stripped you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.

9. For behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a prize for their servants. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.   

10. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For lo, I come, and I will dwell in your midst, says the LORD.

11. And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.

12. And the LORD shall possess Judah, His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.

13. Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He has risen out of His holy dwelling place.  

## Zechariah 3

1. And He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.

2. And the LORD said to Satan, May the LORD rebuke you, Satan! May even the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?

3. Now Joshua was clothed with filthy clothes, and stood before the Angel.

4. And He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy clothes from him. And to him He said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with ceremonial robes.

5. And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. And they set a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the Angel of the LORD stood by.

6. And the Angel of the LORD charged Joshua, saying,

7. So says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in My ways, and if you will keep My charge, then you shall also judge My house, and shall also keep My courts, and I will give you places to walk among these who stand by.   

8. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men of symbol.

9. For behold! I will bring forth My Servant the Branch. For behold the stone that I have set before Joshua: On one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its engraving, says the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

10. In that day, says the LORD of hosts, you shall call, each man to his neighbor, to sit under the vine and under the fig tree.  

## Zechariah 4

1. And the angel that talked with me came again and awakened me, as a man that is awakened out of his sleep.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand, all of it gold, and a bowl on its top, and its seven lamps on it, and seven pipes to the seven lamps on its top;

3. and two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and the other on the left of it.

4. And I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?

5. Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Do you know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

6. Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.

7. Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings, Grace! Grace to it!

8. And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

9. The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.

10. For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the LORD which run to and fro through the whole earth.   

11. And I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?

12. And I answered again and said to him, What are the two olive clusters beside the two golden pipes, emptying the golden oil from themselves?

13. And he answered me and said, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

14. And he said, These are the two sons of fresh oil who stand by the LORD of the whole earth.  

## Zechariah 5

1. And I again lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold! A flying scroll.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.

3. And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth; for from now on everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be cut off according to it.

4. I will bring it forth, says the LORD of hosts; and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall devour it, and its timber and its stones.   

5. Then the angel who talked with me went forth and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.

6. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This is their form in all the earth.

7. And behold, a lead cover was lifted up, and a woman was sitting in the middle of the ephah.

8. And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah. And he cast the lead stone over its opening.

9. And I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, two women came out. And the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.

10. And I said to the angel who talked with me, Where are they going with the ephah?

11. And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be established and set there on its own base.  

## Zechariah 6

1. And I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold! Four chariots were coming from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze.

2. Red horses were in the first chariot; and in the second chariot black horses;

3. and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot horses with dappled, strong colors.

4. And I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord?

5. And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of the heavens who go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.

6. The black horses in it go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the dappled go forth to a south country.

7. And the strong colored ones went forth and sought to go, so to walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Go! Walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

8. And he cried to me and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these who go toward the north country have caused My Spirit to rest in the north country.   

9. And the word of the LORD came to me saying,

10. Take from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, from the exiles who have come from Babylon; and in that day you go and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.

11. And take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

12. And speak to him, saying, So speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the Man whose name is The BRANCH! And He shall spring up out of His place, and He shall build the temple of the LORD.

13. Even He shall build the temple of the LORD; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on His throne. And He shall be a priest on His throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.

14. And the crowns shall be for a memorial in the temple of the LORD to Helem and to Tobijah and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah.

15. And the distant ones shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall be, if you will carefully obey the voice of the LORD your God.  

## Zechariah 7

1. And it happened in the fourth year of king Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chislev.

2. And Sherezer and Regem-melech and his men had been sent to the house of God, to seek the favor of the LORD,

3. to speak to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, consecrating myself, as I have done these many years?

4. And came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,

5. Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months, even those seventy years, did you truly fast to Me, even to Me?

6. And when you ate, and when you drank, was it not for you. the eaters, and for you, the drinkers?

7. Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited, and prosperous, and her cities all around her, and the Negev and the Shephelah were inhabited?   

8. And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,

9. So speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Judge true judgment, and practice kindness and pity, each man to his brother.

10. And do not crush the widow or the orphan, the alien or the poor. And do not devise evil in your heart, of a man against his brother.

11. But they refused to listen, and gave a stubborn shoulder, and made heavy their ears from hearing.

12. And they made their hearts adamant from hearing the law and the words which the LORD of hosts has sent through His Spirit, by the former prophets. And great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.

13. And it will be, as He called, and they did not listen, so they called, and I did not listen, says the LORD of hosts.

14. But I stormed them away on all the nations whom they did not know. And the land has been wasted behind them, from passing and from returning; for they made the land of desire a waste.  

## Zechariah 8

1. And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

2. So says the LORD of hosts: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

3. So says the LORD: I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.

4. So says the LORD of hosts: There shall yet be old men and old women living in the streets of Jerusalem, and each man with his staff in his hand because of their many days.

5. And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.

6. So says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be marvelous in My eyes, says the LORD of hosts?

7. So says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the east country, and from the land of the setting sun.

8. And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.   

9. So says the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the house of the LORD of hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.

10. For before these days there was no payment for man, nor was there payment for animal; and there was no peace to him from the adversary who went out or came in. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.

11. But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says the LORD of hosts.

12. For the seed shall be blessed; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.

13. And it will be, as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear, but let your hands be strong.

14. For so says the LORD of hosts: As I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says the LORD of hosts, and I did not repent;

15. so again I have thought in these days to do well to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear not.

16. These are the things that you shall do. Each man speak the truth to his neighbor. Judge with truth and justice for peace in your gates.

17. And let each devise no evil in your heart against his neighbor; and love no false oath. For all these are things that I hate, says the LORD.   

18. And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

19. So says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah for joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.

20. So says the LORD of hosts: There yet shall be peoples and inhabitants of many cities;

21. and the residents of one shall go to another, saying, Let us go at once to seek favor of the face of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will go also.

22. And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to seek the favor of the face of the LORD.

23. So says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men, out of all languages of the nations, shall take hold, and will seize the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.  

## Zechariah 9

1. The burden of the word of the LORD against the land of Hadrach, and its resting-place, Damascus (when the eye of man, and all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD);

2. and Hamath also borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though very wise.

3. And Tyre shall build herself a stronghold, and shall heap up silver like the dust, and gold like the mud of the streets;

4. behold, the Lord will cast her out, and He will strike her wealth in the sea, and she shall be burned up with fire.

5. Ashkelon shall see and fear; Gaza also shall writhe in great pain; and Ekron shall be ashamed for her hope. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

6. And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

7. And I will take away his bloods out of his mouth, and his idolatries from between his teeth. But the remnant, even he, shall be for our God. And he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron like a Jebusite.

8. And I will camp around My house because of an army, because of him who passed by, and because of him who returns. And no tyrant shall pass through them any more. For now I have seen with My eyes.   

9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, your King comes to you. He is righteous and victorious, meek and riding on an ass, even on a colt, the son of an ass.

10. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace to the nations; and His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

11. You also, by the blood of Your covenant I have freed Your prisoners out of the pit in which is no water.   

12. Turn to the stronghold, prisoners of hope; even today I declare that I will return to you double.

13. For I have bent Judah for me as a bow; I filled it with Ephraim, and I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and make you as the sword of a mighty man.

14. And the LORD shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth like the lightning; and the Lord GOD shall blow the ram's horn, and shall go out with the windstorms of the south.

15. The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour and trample the slingstones. And they shall drink and be boisterous, as through wine. And they shall be filled like a bowl, and like the corners of the altar.

16. And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they are as stones of a crown, lifted up as a banner over His land.

17. For how great is its goodness and how great its beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.  

## Zechariah 10

1. Ask rain from the LORD in the time of the latter rain. The LORD shall make storm clouds, and He gives them showers of rain, grass to everyone in the field.

2. For the family idols speak iniquity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams. They comfort in vain; therefore they wandered like a flock; they were troubled because there was no shepherd.

3. My anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for the LORD of hosts has visited His flock the house of Judah, and has made them as His beautiful horse in battle.

4. Out of Him came the cornerstone; out of Him the nail; out of Him the battle bow; out of Him every oppressor together.   

5. And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because the LORD is with them, and they shall make the riders on horses ashamed.

6. And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will return to save them; for I have pity on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off; for I am the LORD their God, and I will answer them.

7. And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall rejoice as by wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

8. I will hiss for them and gather them; for I have redeemed them. And they shall be many as they were many.

9. And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in the distances; and they shall live with their sons and return.

10. I will return them out of the land of Egypt, and I will gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; for room shall not be found for them.

11. And he shall pass through the sea of distress, and shall strike the waves in the sea; and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be humbled, and the scepter of Egypt shall move away.

12. And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in His name, says the LORD.  

## Zechariah 11

1. Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that the fire may devour your cedars.

2. Howl, juniper; for the cedar has fallen; because the majestic trees are devastated. Howl, O oaks of Bashan; for the inaccessible forest has come down.

3. There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is destroyed. There is a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is destroyed.   

4. For so says the LORD my God: Feed the flock of the slaughter,

5. those buying them kill them, and hold themselves not guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich; and their shepherds do not pity them.

6. For I will never again pity the people of the land, says the LORD; but lo, I will make the men come out, each one into his neighbor's hand and into his king's hand. And they shall strike the land, and I will not deliver out of their hand.

7. And I fed the flock of slaughter, even the poor of the flock. And I took two staffs for myself; the one I called Kindness, and the other I called Union. And I fed the flock.

8. I also cut off three shepherds in one month; and my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also despised me.

9. And I said, I will not feed you; that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off. And those left, let them eat, each woman her neighbor's flesh.

10. And I took my staff Kindness, and broke it apart, to break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

11. And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock who were watching Me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

12. And I said to them, If it is good, give My price; and if not, let it go. So they weighed My price thirty pieces of silver.

13. And the LORD said to me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.

14. Then I broke My other staff Union apart, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.   

15. And the LORD said to me, Take to yourself yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

16. For lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those going to ruin, nor will he seek the young, nor will heal that which is broken, nor will he feed that which stands. But he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear off their hoofs.

17. Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword shall be on his arm and on his right eye; his arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.  

## Zechariah 12

1. The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, says the LORD, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.

2. Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the peoples all around, and it shall also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.

3. And in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all peoples. All who lift it shall be slashed, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.

4. In that day, says the LORD, I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness. And I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.

5. And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The people of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.

6. In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among cut grain. And they shall devour all the peoples all around, on the right hand and on the left hand. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her place, in Jerusalem.

7. The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the people of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.

8. In that day the LORD shall defend around the people of Jerusalem. And it will be, he who is feeble among them at that day shall be like David; and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of the LORD before them.   

9. And it shall be in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

10. And I will pour on the house of David, and on the people of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of prayers. And they shall look on Me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be bitter over Him, as the bitterness over the first-born.

11. In that day shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.

12. And the land shall mourn, each family apart; the family of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart

13. the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

14. all the families who remain, each family apart and their wives apart.  

## Zechariah 13

1. In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the people of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.

2. And it shall be in that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall be remembered no more. And also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

3. And it shall be when any shall yet prophesy, his father and his mother who gave birth to him shall say to him then, You shall not live; for you speak lies in the name of the LORD. And his father and his mother who gave him birth shall thrust him through when he prophesies.

4. And it shall be in that day, the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision, when he prophesies. And they shall not wear a hairy garment to deceive.

5. But he shall say, I am no prophet; I am a man, a tiller of the ground; for a man taught me to buy from my youth.

6. And one shall say to him, What are these wounds in your hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of those who love Me.   

7. Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man who is My companion, says the LORD of hosts; strike the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. And I will turn My hand on the little ones.

8. And it shall be in all the land, says the LORD, two parts in it shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left in it.

9. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name, and I will answer them; I will say, It is My people; and they shall say, The LORD is my God.  

## Zechariah 14

1. Behold, the day of the LORD comes, and your spoil shall be divided in your midst.

2. For I will gather all nations to battle against Jerusalem; and the city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women raped. And half of the city shall go into exile, and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.

3. And the LORD shall go out and fight against those nations, like the day He fought in the day of battle.

4. And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall divide from its middle, from the east and to the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

5. And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.

6. And it will be in that day, there shall not be light; the glorious ones shall shrink.

7. And it will be one day which shall be known to the LORD, neither day nor night; but it will happen that at evening time it shall be light.   

8. And it shall be in that day, living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them shall go toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea. In summer and in winter it shall be.

9. And the LORD shall be King over all the earth; in that day there shall be one LORD, and His name shall be one.

10. All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And it shall rise and dwell in its place, from Benjamin's Gate to the place of the First Gate; to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.

11. And they shall dwell in it, and there shall never again be a shutting in, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.

12. And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem. Their flesh shall rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall rot in their sockets. And their tongue shall rot in their mouth.

13. And it shall be in that day a great panic of the LORD shall be among them And they shall each one lay hold of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.

14. And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations all around shall be gathered, gold, and silver, and clothing in great abundance.

15. And so shall be the plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and of all the beasts which shall be in these tents, like this plague.   

16. And it shall be, everyone who is left of all the nations which came up against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

17. And it shall be, whoever will not come up from all the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, even on them shall be no rain.

18. And if the family of Egypt does not go up, and nor come in, they shall have no rain, but the plague with which the LORD shall strike the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

19. This shall be Egypt's offense, and the offense of all the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

20. In that day there shall be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO THE LORD. And the pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.

21. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to the LORD of hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them. And in that day there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the LORD of hosts.
