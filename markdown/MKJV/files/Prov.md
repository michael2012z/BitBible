## Proverbs 1

1. The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

2. to know wisdom and instruction; to recognize the words of understanding;

3. to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and uprightness;

4. to give sense to the simple, knowledge and judgment to the young man;

5. the wise hears and increases learning; and understanding ones gets wisdom;

6. to understand a proverb and its meaning; the words of the wise, and their acute sayings.   

7. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

8. My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother;

9. for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head and chains around your neck.   

10. My son, if sinners lure you, do not be willing.

11. If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, we will watch secretly for the innocent without cause;

12. let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those who go down into the pit;

13. we shall find all precious goods; we shall fill our houses with plunder;

14. cast in your lot among us, and let us have one purse.

15. My son, do not walk in the way with them! Keep back your foot from their path,

16. for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood.

17. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird,

18. And they lie in wait for their own blood; they watch secretly for their own lives.

19. So are the ways of everyone who gains unjust gain; it takes away its owners' life.   

20. Wisdom cries outside; she utters her voice in the streets;

21. she cries in the chief place of gathering, in the openings of the gates; in the city she utters her words, saying,

22. How long will you love simplicity, simple ones? And will scorners delight in their scorning? And will fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn at my warning; behold, I will pour out my Spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.

24. Because I called, and you refused; I stretched out my hand, and no one paid attention;

25. but you have despised all my advice, and would have none of my warning.

26. I also will laugh at your trouble; I will mock when your fear comes;

27. when your fear comes as a wasting away, and your ruin comes like a tempest when trouble and pain come upon you.

28. Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me;

29. instead they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD.

30. They would have none of my counsel; they despised all my correction,

31. and they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own desires.

32. For the turning away of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.

33. But whoever listens to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.  

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if you will receive My words and hide My commandments with you,

2. so that you attend to wisdom, you shall extend your heart to understanding;

3. yea, if you cry after knowledge and lift up your voice for understanding;

4. if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,

5. then you shall understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.

6. For the LORD gives wisdom; out of His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

7. He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly.

8. He keeps the paths of judgment, and guards the way of His saints.

9. Then you shall understand righteousness and judgment and honesty, every good path.   

10. When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasing to your soul;

11. judgment shall keep you, understanding shall keep you,

12. to deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man who speaks wicked things;

13. those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,

14. who rejoice to do evil and delight in the perversities of the wicked;

15. whose ways are crooked, and are devious in their paths.

16.  They will deliver you from the strange woman, the stranger who flatters with her words,

17. who forsakes the guide of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.

18. For her house bows down to death, and her paths to the dead.

19. All who go in to her do not return, nor do they take hold of the paths of life,

20. in order that you may walk in the way of good and keep the paths of the righteous.

21. For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.  

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, forget not My law; but let your heart keep My commandments;

2. for they shall add length of days, and long life, and peace, to you.

3. Let not mercy and truth forsake you; tie them around your neck; write them upon the tablet of your heart;

4. and you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

5. Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not to your own understanding.

6. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.   

7. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and depart from evil.

8. Healing shall be to your navel and marrow to your bones.

9. Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase;

10. and your barns shall be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst with new wine.

11. My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD; nor be weary with His correction;

12. for whom the LORD loves He corrects, even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights.   

13. Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding.

14. For the profit from it is better than the gain from silver, and its produce more than fine gold;

15. she is more precious than rubies; and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand, riches and honor.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

18. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her; and happy is everyone who keeps her.

19. The LORD has founded the earth by wisdom; by understanding He has founded the heavens.

20. By His knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.   

21. My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and judgment,

22. and they shall be life to your soul and grace to your neck.

23. Then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.

24. When you lie down, you shall not be afraid; yea, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.

25. Do not be afraid of sudden fear, nor of the destroying of the wicked, when it comes.

26. For the LORD shall be your hope, and shall keep your foot from being taken.   

27. Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.

28. Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it beside you:

29. Do not plan evil against your neighbor, since he dwells trustingly by you.

30. Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.

31. Do not envy the cruel man, and choose none of his ways.

32. For the crooked man is hateful to the LORD, but His secret is with the righteous.

33. The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; but He blesses the home of the just.

34. Surely He scorns the scorners; but He gives grace to the lowly.

35. The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of fools.  

## Proverbs 4

1. Sons, hear the instruction of a father, and listen in order to know understanding.

2. For I give you good teaching; do not forsake my law.

3. For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.

4. He also taught me, and said to me, Let your heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments and live.

5. Get wisdom, get understanding; forget not; nor turn away from the words of my mouth.

6. Do not forsake her, and she shall keep you; love her, and she shall keep you.

7. Wisdom is the main thing; get wisdom; and with all your getting get understanding.

8. Prize her, and she shall lift you up; she shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.

9. She shall give to your hand an ornament of grace; she shall shield you with a crown of glory.

10. Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of your life shall be many.

11. I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in the right paths.

12. When you go, your steps shall not be narrowed, and when you run, you shall not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of instruction; do not let go; keep her; for she is your life.   

14. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not into the way of evil.

15. Avoid it; do not pass by it; turn from it, and pass on!

16. For they do not sleep, except when they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.

19. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.   

20. My son, listen to my words; bow down your ear to my sayings.

21. Let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart.

22. For they are life to those who find them, and health to all his flesh.

23. Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.

24. Put away from you a wicked mouth, and devious lips put far from you.

25. Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you.

26. Ponder the path of your feet, and all your ways will be established.

27. Do not turn to the right hand nor to the left; remove your foot from evil.  

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, listen to my wisdom; bow your ear to my understanding;

2. in order to keep discretion, that your lips may keep knowledge.

3. For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her palate is smoother than oil;

4. but afterward she is as bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell,

6. lest you should meditate on the path of life, her tracks are movable; you cannot know them.

7. And now hear me, O sons, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.

8. Remove your ways far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,

9. lest you give your honor to others and your years to the cruel;

10. that strangers not be filled with your strength, and your labors be in the house of a stranger;

11. and you moan when your end comes, when your flesh and muscle are eaten away,

12. and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised correction;

13. and I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor bowed down my ears to those who taught me!

14. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.   

15. Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.

16. Should your overflowing spring he scattered abroad as rivers of waters in the streets.

17. Let them be only your own, and not strangers' with you.

18. Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth.

19.  Like the loving deer and pleasant doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and be ravished always with her love.

20. And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He watches all his paths.

22. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.

23. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you struck your palms with a stranger,

2. you are snared with the words of your mouth, you are taken with the words of your mouth.

3. My son, do this now, and deliver yourself when you have come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself and make your friend sure.

4. Do not give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.

5. Deliver yourself as a gazelle from the hunter's hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.   

6. Go to the ant, sluggard; consider her ways and be wise;

7. who, having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

8. provides her food in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest.

9. How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?

10. A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down;

11. so shall your poverty come as one who travels, and your need like an armed man.   

12. A worthless person, a wicked man walks with a crooked mouth,

13. winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, teaching with his fingers;

14. perversity is in his heart; he is always planning mischief; he causes fighting.

15. Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; he is quickly broken, and there is no healing.

16. These six the LORD hates; yea, seven are hateful to his soul:

17. a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

18. a heart that plots wicked plans, feet hurrying to run to evil,

19. a false witness who speaks lies, and he who causes fighting among brothers.   

20. My son, keep your father's commandments, and do not forsake the law of your mother;

21. bind them upon your heart forever, tie them around your neck.

22. When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you.

23. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life;

24. to keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

25. Do not lust after her beauty in your heart; nor let her take you with her eyelids.

26. For by means of a harlot a man comes to a piece of bread; and another man's wife will hunt for the precious life.

27. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

28. Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

29. So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.

30. They do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

31. but if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the goods of his house.

32. Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; he who does it destroys his own soul.

33. He shall get a wound and dishonor; and his shame shall not he wiped away.

34. For jealousy is the rage of a man; therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

35. He will not take any ransom; nor will he be willing if you multiply the gifts.  

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words and store up my commandments within you.

2. Keep my commandments and live; and keep my law as the pupil of your eye.

3. Bind them upon your fingers; write them upon the tablet of your heart.

4. Say to wisdom, You are my sister; and call understanding your kinsman,

5. so that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the stranger who flatters with her words.   

6. For at the window of my house I looked through my lattice,

7. and I saw among the simple ones, among the youths, a young man with no understanding,

8. passing through the street near her corner. And he went the way to her house,

9. in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night.

10. And, behold, there a woman met him, with the dress of a harlot and a guarded heart.

11. She is loud and stubborn; her feet do not stay in her house;

12. now she is outside, now in the streets, and lies in wait at every corner.

13. And she caught him and kissed him, and with a hard face she said to him,

14.  I have peace offerings with me; today I have paid my vows.

15. so I came out to meet you, earnestly to seek your face, and I have found you.

16. I have decked my bed with coverings, with striped cloths of Egyptian linen.

17. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us delight ourselves with caresses.

19. For my husband is not at home, he has gone on a long journey;

20. he has taken a bag of silver with him and will come home at the day of the full moon.

21. With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

22. He goes after her immediately, like an ox goes to the slaughter, or like a fool to the correction of the stocks;

23. until a dart strikes through his liver; as a bird hastens to the snare and does not know that it is for his soul.   

24. And now listen to me, sons, and attend to the words of my mouth.

25. Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, do not go astray in her paths.

26. For she has cast down many wounded; yea, many strong men have been slain by her.

27. Her house is the way to hell, going down to the rooms of death.  

## Proverbs 8

1. Does not wisdom call? And does not understanding put forth her voice?

2. She stands in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the path.

3. She cries in the gates, before the entrance of the city, at the doors.

4. To you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

5. O simple ones understand wisdom; and, fools, be of an understanding heart.

6. Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.

7. For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is hateful to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; nothing twisted or perverse is in them.

9. They are all plain to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.   

12. I, wisdom, dwell with sense, and find out knowledge of discretions.

13. The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the wicked mouth.

14. Counsel and sound wisdom are Mine; I am understanding; I have strength.

15. By Me kings reign and princes decree justice.

16. Princes rule by Me, and nobles, all the judges of the earth.

17. I love those who love Me; and those who seek Me early shall find Me.

18. Riches and honor are with Me; enduring riches and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and what I give is better than choice silver.

20. I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment;

21. I may cause those who love Me to inherit riches; and I will fill their treasuries.   

22. The LORD possessed Me in the beginning of His way, before His works of old.

23. I was anointed from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth ever was.

24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs heavy with water.

25. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I travailed;

26. before He had made the earth, or the fields or the highest part of the dust of the world.

27. When He prepared the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle upon the face of the deep;

28. when He set the clouds above; when He made the strong fountains of the deep;

29. when He gave to the sea its limit that the waters should not pass His command; when He appointed the foundations of the earth;

30. and I was a workman at His side; and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him;

31. rejoicing in the world, His earth; and My delight was with the sons of men.   

32. And now listen to Me, O sons; for blessed are those who keep My ways.

33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.

34. Blessed is the man who hears Me, watching daily at My gates, waiting at the posts of My doors.

35. For whoever finds Me finds life, and shall obtain favor from the LORD.

36. But he who sins against Me wrongs his own soul; all who hate Me love death.  

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars;

2. she has killed her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.

3. She has sent out her young women; she cries upon the highest places of the city,

4. The simple one, let him turn in here. To one lacking heart, she says to him,

5. Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.

6. Forsake the foolish and live; and go in the way of understanding.

7. One rebuking a scorner gets shame to himself; and one rebuking a wicked one gets himself a blemish.

8. Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you; give to a wise man, and he will love you.

9. Give to a wise one, and he will be still wiser; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.

10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.

11. For by Me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall he increased.

12. If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself; but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.   

13. A foolish woman is noisy; she is simple and knows nothing.

14. For she sits at the door of her house, in a seat in the high places of the city,

15. to call those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways;

16. The simple one, let him turn in here. And to one lacking heart, she says to him,

17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.

18. But he does not know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of hell.  

## Proverbs 10

1. The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father; but a foolish son is the sorrow of his mother.   

2. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; but righteousness delivers from death.

3. The LORD will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry; but He casts away the desire of the wicked.   

4. He who deals with a lazy hand becomes poor; but the hand of the hard worker makes rich.   

5. He who gathers in summer is a wise son; but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.   

6. Blessings are on the head of the just; but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.   

7. The memory of the just is blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot.   

8. The wise in heart will receive commandments; but a babbling fool shall fall.   

9. He who walks uprightly walks surely; but he who twists his ways shall be known.   

10. He who winks the eye causes sorrow; but a babbling fool shall fall.   

11. The mouth of a righteous one is a well of life; but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.   

12. Hatred stirs up fights, but love covers all sins.   

13. In the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found; but a rod is for the back of him who is without understanding.   

14. Wise ones store up knowledge; but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.   

15. The rich man's wealth is his strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty.   

16. The labor of the righteous tends to life; the fruit of the wicked tends to sin.   

17. He who keeps instruction is in the way of life; but he who refuses reproof goes astray.   

18. He who hides hatred with lying lips, and he who speaks a slander, is a fool.   

19. In the multitude of words, sin is not lacking; but he who holds back his lips is wise.   

20. The tongue of the just is as choice silver; the heart of the wicked is worth little.

21. The lips of the righteous feed many; but fools die for lack of wisdom.   

22. The blessing of the LORD itself makes rich, and He adds no sorrow with it.   

23. To work out evil devices is as laughter to a fool; so wisdom is to a man of understanding.   

24. What the wicked fears shall come upon him; but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.

25. As the storm passes, so the wicked is no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.   

26. Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.   

27. The fear of the LORD prolongs days; but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.

28. The hope of the righteous is gladness; but the hope of the wicked shall perish.   

29. The way of the LORD is strength to the upright; but ruin is to the workers of iniquity.

30. The righteous shall never be moved; and the wicked shall not live in the earth.   

31. The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom; but the perverse tongue shall be cut out.

32. The lips of the righteous know what is pleasing; but the mouth of the wicked what is contrary.  

## Proverbs 11

1. False balances are hateful to the LORD; but a just weight is His delight.   

2. Pride comes, then shame comes; but with the lowly is wisdom.   

3. The integrity of the upright shall guide them; but the crookedness of traitors shall destroy them.   

4. Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.   

5. The righteousness of the perfect shall make his way right, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

6. The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but deceivers shall be taken in lust.   

7. When a wicked man dies, his hope shall perish; and the hope of evil ones shall be lost.   

8. The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his place.   

9. A hypocrite corrupts his neighbor with his mouth; but through knowledge the just shall be delivered.   

10. When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; and when the wicked are destroyed, there is singing.

11. By the blessing of the upright the city is lifted up, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.   

12. One despising his friend lacks heart, but a man of understanding remains silent.

13. One going with slander is a revealer of secrets, but the faithful of spirit keeps the matter hidden.   

14. Where there is no wisdom, the people fall; but in the multitude of wise men there is safety.   

15. He who is surety for a stranger shall be ruined; and he who hates suretyship is safe.   

16. A gracious woman keeps honor, and the strong keep riches.   

17. The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.   

18. The wicked makes a deceitful wage; but one sowing righteousness has a sure reward.   

19. So righteousness tends to life; but one pursuing evil, it is to his own death.   

20. They who are of a perverse heart are hateful to the LORD, but the upright in the way are His delight.   

21.  Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be innocent; but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.   

22.  Like a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a beautiful woman who turns aside discretion.   

23. The desire of the righteous is only good; the hope of the wicked is wrath.   

24. There is one who scatters and yet increases; but one who withholds just due comes only to poverty.   

25. The soul who gives freely shall be made fat; and he who waters shall also be watered himself.   

26. He who withholds grain, the people shall curse him; but blessing is on the head of him who sells.   

27. He who carefully seeks good gets favor; but he who seeks mischief, it shall come to him.   

28. He who trusts in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall blossom like a branch.   

29. He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind; and the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart.   

30. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he who wins souls is wise.   

31. Behold, the righteous shall be rewarded in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner.  

## Proverbs 12

1. Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge; but he who hates correction is like a brute animal.   

2. The good gets grace from the LORD, but He will condemn a man of wicked thoughts.   

3. A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.   

4. A woman of virtue is a crown to her husband, but she who causes shame is like rottenness in his bones.   

5. The thoughts of the righteous are right; the counsels of the wicked are deceit.   

6. The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood; but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

32. If you have done foolishly in lifting yourself up, or if you have thought evil, lay your hand on your mouth.
