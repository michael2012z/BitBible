# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians, in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.   

2. We give thanks to God for you always, making mention of you in our prayers,

3. remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father,

4. knowing, beloved brothers, your election of God.

5. For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.   

6. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, welcoming the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,

7. so that you were examples to all who believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

8. For from you the Word of the Lord sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to speak anything.

9. For they themselves witness what kind of entrance we had to you, even how you turned from idols to God in order to serve the living and true God,

10. and to wait for His Son from Heaven (whom He raised from the dead), Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.  

## 1 Thessalonians 2

1. For, my brothers, you yourselves know our coming in to you, that it was not in vain.

2. But also suffering before, being insulted in Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much agony.

3. For our exhortation to you was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,

4. but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.

5. For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor with pretense of covetousness; God is witness.

6. Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, being able to be so with heaviness, as apostles of Christ.   

7. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse warmly cherishes her children.

8. So affectionately longing for you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls, because you have become beloved to us.

9. For, brothers, you remember our labor and toil. For laboring night and day in order not to put a burden on any one of you, we preached the gospel of God to you.

10. You and God are witnesses how holily and justly and blamelessly we were to you who believe,

11. even as you know how we exhorted and comforted and testified to each one of you, as a father to his children,

12. that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.   

13. And for this cause we thank God without ceasing, that when you received the Word of hearing, of God, you welcomed it as the Word of God, not as a word of men, but as it is, truly the Word of God, which also effectually works in you who believe.

14. For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also have suffered these things by your own countrymen, even as they also by the Jews;

15. who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, also driving us out and they do not please God and being contrary to all men,

16. forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always; but the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.   

17. But, my brothers, when we were taken away from you for an hour's time (in presence, not in heart), we were much more eager with much desire to see your face.

18. Therefore we desired to come to you, truly I, Paul, both once and twice; but Satan hindered us.

19. For what is our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are you not even to be in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?

20. For you are our glory and joy.  

## 1 Thessalonians 3

1. Therefore when we could no longer endure, we were pleased to be left at Athens alone.

2. And we sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,

3. so that no one should be drawn aside by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to them.

4. For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we were going to suffer affliction, as it also happened, even you know.

5. For this cause, when I could no longer endure, I also sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you and our labor may have been in vain.   

6. But now when Timothy came from you to us and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us (as we also you),

7. then, my brothers, we were comforted over you, through your faith, even in all our affliction and needs;

8. for now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.

9. For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God,

10. night and day praying exceedingly for me to see your face and to perfect the things lacking in your faith?   

11. And may God Himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.

12. And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all, even as we do toward you,

13. in order to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.  

## 1 Thessalonians 4

1. For the rest, then, my brothers, we beseech you and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as you have received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.

2. For we know what commands we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

3. For this is the will of God, your sanctification, for you to abstain from fornication,

4. each one of you to know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor

5. (not in the passion of lust, even as the nations who do not know God),

6. not to go beyond and defraud his brother in this matter (because the Lord is the avenger concerning all these, as we also have forewarned you and testified).

7. For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.

8. Therefore he who despises does not despise man, but God, who also has given us His Holy Spirit.   

9. But regarding brotherly love, you do not need that I write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.

10. And indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we beseech you, brothers, that you abound more and more,

11. and that you try earnestly to be quiet and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,

12. so that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and that you may lack nothing.   

13. But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, that you be not grieved, even as others who have no hope.

14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him all those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.

15. For we say this to you by the Word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not go before those who are asleep.

16. For the Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first.

17. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. And so we shall ever be with the Lord.

18. Therefore comfort one another with these words.  

## 1 Thessalonians 5

1. But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.

2. For you yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.

3. For when they shall say, Peace and safety! Then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail upon a woman with child. And they shall not escape.

4. But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that the Day should overtake you like a thief.

5. You are all the sons of light and the sons of the day. We are not of the night, or of darkness.   

6. Therefore let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us watch and be calm.

7. For those sleeping sleep in the night, and those being drunken are drunken in the night.

8. But let us, who are of the day, be calm, having put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope of salvation for a helmet.

9. For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

10. who died for us, so that whether we watch or sleep we should live together with Him.   

11. Therefore comfort one another, and edify one another, even as you also do.

12. And, brothers, we beseech you to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and who admonish you,

13. and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

14. Now we exhort you, brothers, warn those who are unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.

15. See that none gives evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue the good, both towards one another and towards all.   

16. Rejoice evermore.

17. Pray without ceasing.

18. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

19. Do not quench the Spirit.

20. Do not despise prophesying.

21. Prove all things, hold fast to the good.

22. Abstain from every appearance of evil.   

23. And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

24. Faithful is He who called you, who also will do it.

25. Brothers, pray for us.

26. Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

27. I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.

28. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
