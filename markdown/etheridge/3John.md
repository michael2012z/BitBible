## 3 John 1

1. THE presbyter unto Gaios my beloved, whom I love in truth.

2. Our beloved, in all things I pray for thee, that thou mayest prosper and be healthful, even as thy soul prospereth.

3. For I have rejoiced greatly when the brethren have come, and have testified concerning thy integrity, even as in the truth thou walkest.

4. And greater joy than this I have not (than) when I hear that my sons walk in the truth.

5. Our beloved, in faithfulness thou performest what thou doest unto the brethren, and especially to those who are strangers,

6. who have testified of thy charity, before all the church, to whom thou hast done well according to that which is worthy of Aloha.

7. For after his name they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.

8. We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be helpers of the truth.

9. I would have written to the church; but he who loveth to be foremost of you, Diotrapas, receiveth us not.

10. On account of this, if I come, I will remember the works which he doeth, who words of evil maketh concerning us; and these not satisfying him, he hath not received the brethren, and those who receive he forbiddeth, and also expelleth from the church.

11. Our beloved, be not imitative of the evil, but of the good. He who doeth good is of Aloha, and he who doeth evil hath not seen Aloha.

12. Concerning Demetrios is a testimony from every man, and from the church, and from the truth itself. But we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.

13. I have many things which I would write to thee, but I will not with ink and reed write to thee.

14. But I hope that soon I shall see thee, and mouth to mouth we will speak. Peace be with thee. The friends ask thy peace. Ask the peace of the friends each by his name.
