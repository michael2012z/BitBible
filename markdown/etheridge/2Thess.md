# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. PAULOS, and Sylvanos, and Timotheos, to the church of the Thesalonikoyee, which is in Aloha our Father, and our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

2. Grace be with you, and peace, from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

3. To give thanks we owe to Aloha at all time on behalf of you, my brethren, as it is proper; because your faith greatly increaseth, and the love of you all, of every man toward his neighbour, enlargeth;

4. as that we also boast of you in the churches of Aloha, of your faith and of your patience, in all your persecution and your affliction which you endure;

5. for a demonstration of the just judgment of Aloha, that you may be worthy of his kingdom, for the sake of which you suffer;

6. and whether it is (not) righteous to render afflictions to them who afflict you.

7. And you who are afflicted will he save with us, at the revelation of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from heaven, with the host Of his angels, when he executeth the punishment, with burning of fire,

8. on them who have not known Aloha, and on them who have not acknowledged the gospel of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

9. For these in the judgment will be punished (with) the perdition of eternity, from the presence of our Lord, and from the glory of his power;

10. when he cometh to be glorified in his saints, and to show his wonders in his faithful ones, that our testimony that was concerning you may be believed in that day.

11. On account of this at all time pray we for you, that Aloha may make you meet for your calling, and complete in you all the will of good (things), and the operations of faith with power;

12. that the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha may be glorified in you, and you also in him, according to the grace of Aloha and our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. But we beseech of you, my brethren, as it regards the coming of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and our assemblage with him,

2. that you be not soon moved in your minds, nor perturbed, nor by word, nor by spirit, nor by letter, which (may be) as (if it were) from us, that, Behold, the day of our Lord cometh!

3. Let no one deceive you by any one of the methods, because unless there shall come first the rebellion, and there be revealed the man of sin, the son of perdition;

4. He who is the adversary, and is exalted over all who is called God and Venerable; so that also in the temple of Aloha as Aloha he will sit, and will make manifest of himself as that he is Aloha.

5. Do you not remember, that, when I was with you, these I told you?

6. And now you know what holdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.

7. For the mystery of iniquity already beginneth to be effective; only if that which now holdeth be taken from the midst,

8. then will be revealed that evil one, whom our Lord Jeshu will consume by the spirit of his mouth, and will abolish by the revelation of his advent.

9. For the coming of that (wicked one) is the working of Satana, with all power, and (with) signs and false miracles,

10. and with all unrighteous deception which is done in them who perish, because they have not received the love of the truth by which they might have been saved.

11. Wherefore Aloha will send them the working of deception,

12. that they will believe the lie, and all of them will be judged who have not believed in the truth, but have had pleasure in unrighteousness.

13. But we are bound to give thanks unto Aloha at all time for you, our brethren, beloved in our Lord, because Aloha hath chosen you from the beginning unto salvation, by sanctification of the Spirit, and by the belief of the truth.

14. For unto these Aloha called you by our preaching, that you should be the glory of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.

15. Wherefore, my brethren, stand fast, and persevere in the precepts which you have been taught, whether by word, or by our epistle.

16. But our Lord Jeshu Meshiha himself, and Aloha our Father, who hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and a good hope through grace,

17. will comfort your hearts, and establish in every word and in every work of good.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Henceforth, my brethren, pray for us, that the word of our Lord may run and be glorified in every place, as among you.

2. And that we may be delivered from wicked men and perverse; for every man hath not faith.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will keep you and deliver you from evil.

4. But we confide concerning you in our Lord, that what we have commanded you, you have done,

5. and also are doing. And our Lord will direct your hearts to the love of Aloha, and to the patience of the Meshiha.

6. But we command you, my brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, that you remove from every brother who walketh wickedly, and not according to the precepts which he hath received from us.

7. For you know how it behoveth to imitate us who walked not wickedly among you.

8. Neither did we eat bread for nothing from any one of you; but with labour and weariness by night and by day we wrought, that upon no one of you we might be burdensome.

9. Not because we had not power, but because in ourselves we would give you an example, that you may imitate us.

10. For while we were with you, this we commanded you, that every one who willeth not to work, neither should he eat.

11. For we hear that there are some among you who walk wickedly, and nothing work, unless vain things.

12. But these we command, and entreat of them by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, that with quietness they work, and eat their (own) bread.

13. But you, my brethren, be not weary in doing what is good.

14. And if any man hearken not to these our words in the epistle, let this be separate from you, and be not mixed with him, that he be shamed.

15. Yet, not as an enemy hold him, but admonish him as a brother.

16. But the Lord of peace himself will give you peace always, in every thing. Our Lord be with you all.

17. Salutation, by the writing of my hand, I, PAULOS, have written; which is the sign in all my epistles, so I write.

18. The grace of Jeshu Meshiha be with you all, my brethren. Amen.
