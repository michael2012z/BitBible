## Titus 1

1. PAULOS, a servant of Aloha, and apostle of Jeshu Meshiha, for the faith of the chosen ones of Aloha, and the knowledge of the truth which is in the fear of Aloha;

2. unto the hope of eternal life, which Aloha the true counselled before the times of the ages,

3. and his word hath revealed in his time by our preaching, which was confided to me by the command of Aloha our Saviour:

4. To Titos, my true son in the common faith. Grace and peace from Aloha the Father and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha our Saviour.

5. For this I left thee in Kreta, that those things which were wanting thou mayest rectify, and constitute presbyters in every city as I commanded thee.

6. Him who is without blame, and is the husband of one wife, and who hath believing children, who are not vicious nor addicted to intemperance.

7. For a presbyter is bound to be without blame, as the steward of Aloha; he shall not be led by the will of self, nor be irascible, nor a transgressor over wine, neither shall his hand be hasty to strike, nor shall he be a lover of sordid gains.

8. But he shall be a lover of guests, and a lover of the good, and be chaste, and equitable, and holy, and withholding himself from lusts;

9. and careful over the doctrine of the word of faith, that he may be able also to comfort by his teaching the healthy, and to reprove those who are contentious.

10. For there are many who are not in subjection, and whose words are vain, and make the minds of men to err, especially those of the circumcision,

11. those, whose mouths it behoves to stop. Many houses they destroy, and teach what they ought not, for the sake of filthy gain.

12. One of them, a prophet of their own, hath said, The sons of Kreta are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy bellies.

13. And true is this testimony. Wherefore reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,

14. nor cast themselves to the fables of the Jihudoyee, and to the mandates of men who hate the truth.

15. For every thing is pure to the pure; but to those who are polluted and unfaithful nothing is pure; but their understanding and their conscience are polluted.

16. And they profess to know Aloha, but in their works they deny him, and are abominable and disobedient, and reprobate to every good work.

## Titus 2

1. But speak thou that which becometh sound doctrine,

2. and teach, That the elders be watchful in their minds, and be chaste and pure, and sound in the faith, and in charity, and in patience.

3. And so also the aged women, that they be in behaviour what becometh the fear of Aloha, and not slanderers, nor enslaved to much wine, and that they teach good things;

4. making those who are young modest, to love their husbands and their children,

5. and to be chaste and holy, well mindful of their houses, and submissive to their husbands, that no man blaspheme the word of Aloha.

6. And of those who are young men, likewise, require that they be chaste.

7. But in every thing show thyself the example in all good works, and in doctrine let there be with thee sound speech which is sincere and incorrupt,

8. and which no man will despise, that he who riseth against us may be ashamed when he cannot say any thing hateful against us.

9. Let servants to their masters be submissive in every thing, and please them, not contradicting,

10. nor pilfering; but let them show their good-trustiness in every thing, that they may adorn in every thing the doctrine of Aloha our Saviour.

11. FOR the all-saving grace of Aloha hath appeared to all men,

12. and teacheth us to deny wickedness and the lusts of the world, and to live in this world in purity, and in rectitude, and in the fear of Aloha,

13. while expecting the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jeshu Meshiha;

14. who gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to cleanse unto himself a new people, who are zealous of good works.

15. These speak, and require, and maintain with all authority, and no man shall despise thee.

## Titus 3

1. Put them in mind that to princes and to powers they are to hearken and to be obedient, and to be prepared for every good work.

2. And against no man to rail, nor be contentious, but gentle, and in every thing to show their benignity towards all men.

3. For we also were afore-time without understanding, and disobedient and erring, and were subjected to various lusts; and in malice, and in envy we conversed, and were hateful, and also hating one another.

4. But when appeared the goodness and mercy of Aloha our Saviour,

5. not by works of righteousness which we had done, but by his own mercy he saved us, by the laving of the birth which is afresh, by the renewing of the Spirit of Holiness,

6. which he shed upon us abundantly, by Jeshu Meshiha our Saviour;

7. that by his grace we might be justified, and be made heirs according to the hope of the life which is eternal.

8. Faithful is the word; and in this I will that thou also establish them, that they should be careful to perform good works, they who have believed in Aloha. These are good and profitable unto men.

9. But from foolish disputations, and from tales of genealogies, and from contentions, and strifes of the sophree, withdraw; for profit is not in them, and they are vain.

10. From an heretical man, after one time and twice thou hast admonished him, withdraw;

11. and know that he who is such is perverse, and sinneth, and condemneth himself.

12. When I have sent to thee Artema, or Tykikos, be careful to come to me at Nikopolis; for there I have determined in my mind to winter.

13. But concerning Zina the sophra, and Apolo, be careful to provide them well, that nothing may be wanting to them.

14. And let those also who are of us, learn to perform good works in things which are necessary, that they may not be without fruits.

15. All they who are with me ask for thy peace. Ask for the peace of all who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you. Amen.
