# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,

2. Even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

3. It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,

4. That thou mayest know the certainty of those things, in which thou hast been instructed.

5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

6. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

7. And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.

8. And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,

9. According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.

11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

13. But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.

14. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.

15. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.

16. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.

17. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well advanced in years.

19. And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.

20. And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.

21. And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.

22. And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he made signs to them, and remained speechless.

23. And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

24. And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,

25. Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.

26. And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

27. To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.

28. And the angel came to her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. 

29. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what manner of greeting this should be.

30. And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.

31. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:

33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

34. Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?

35. And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing who shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

36. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.

37. For with God nothing shall be impossible.

38. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

39. And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;

40. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elisabeth.

41. And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:

42. And she spoke with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

43. And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

45. And blessed is she that believed: that there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. 

46. And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

47. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

48. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

49. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.

50. And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.

51. He hath shown strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

52. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.

53. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent away empty.

54. He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;

55. As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

56. And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.

57. Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.

58. And her neighbours and her cousins heard that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

59. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.

60. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.

61. And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.

62. And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.

63. And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marvelled.

64. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.

65. And fear came on all that dwelt around them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. 

66. And all they that had heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,

69. And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;

70. As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began:

71. That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;

72. To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;

73. The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,

74. That he would grant to us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

75. In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.

76. And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

77. To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, 

78. Through the tender mercy of our God; with which the dayspring from on high hath visited us, 

79. To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

80. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. 

2. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

3. And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

5. To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 

6. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.

7. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 

9. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them: and they were in great fear.

10. And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

11. For to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.

12. And this shall be a sign to you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

15. And it came to pass, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us. 

16. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.

17. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.

18. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them.

21. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;

23. (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

24. And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

25. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

26. And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.

27. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,

28. Then he took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

29. Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:

30. For my eyes have seen thy salvation,

31. Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

32. A light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

33. And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken concerning him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

35. (And, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

36. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;

37. And she was a widow of about eighty and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.

38. And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. 

39. And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

41. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.

42. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.

43. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.

44. But they, supposing him to be in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.

45. And when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.

47. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.

48. And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

49. And he said to them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?

50. And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.

51. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. 

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 

2. Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

3. And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

4. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

5. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

7. Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say to you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 

9. And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

10. And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

11. He answereth and saith to them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.

12. Then came also tax collectors to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do?

13. And he said to them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.

14. And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. 

15. And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, whether he was the Christ, or not; 

16. John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you in water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:

17. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

18. And many other things in his exhortation he preached to the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him on account of Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,

20. Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

21. Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

22. And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

23. And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli,

24. Who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Janna, who was the son of Joseph,

25. Who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Amos, who was the son of Nahum, who was the son of Esli, who was the son of Nagge,

26. Who was the son of Maath, who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Semei, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Judah,

27. Who was the son of Joanna, who was the son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zerubbabel, who was the son of Shealtiel, who was the son of Neri,

28. Who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Addi, who was the son of Cosam, who was the son of Elmodam, who was the son of Er,

29. Who was the son of Joshua, who was the son of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi,

30. Who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Judas, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonan, who was the son of Eliakim,

31. Who was the son of Melea, who was the son of Menan, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who was the son of David,

32. Who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the son of Nahshon,

33. Who was the son of Amminadab, who was the son of Ram, who was the son of Hezron, who was the son of Perez, who was the son of Judah,

34. Who was the son of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Terah, who was the son of Nahor,

35. Who was the son of Serug, who was the son of Reu, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Eber, who was the son of Shelah,

36. Who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech,

37. Who was the son of Methuselah, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Mahalaleel, who was the son of Cainan,

38. Who was the son of Enos, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.

## Luke 4

1. And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

2. Being forty days tempted by the devil. And in those days he ate nothing: and when they were ended, he was afterward hungry.

3. And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.

4. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

5. And the devil, taking him up upon an high mountain, showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

6. And the devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomever I will I give it.

7. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 

8. And Jesus answered and said to him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

9. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from here:

10. For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:

11. And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

12. And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

13. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.

14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the surrounding region.

15. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and stood up to read.

17. And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

19. To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

20. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.

21. And he began to say to them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.

22. And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?

23. And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

24. And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.

25. But I tell you in truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;

26. But to none of them was Elijah sent, except to Zarephath, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.

27. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,

29. And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. 

30. But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

31. And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.

32. And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.

33. And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,

34. Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. 

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.

36. And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

37. And the fame of him went out into every place in the surrounding country.

38. And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And the mother of Simon’s wife was sick with a high fever; and they besought him for her.

39. And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to them.

40. Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.

41. And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them did not allow them to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. 

42. And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and would have restrained him, that he should not depart from them.

43. And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

44. And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

2. And saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

3. And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the boat.

4. Now when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

5. And Simon answering said to him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.

6. And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.

7. And they beckoned to their partners, who were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.

8. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

9. For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:

10. And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

11. And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all, and followed him.

12. And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

13. And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

15. But so much the more a fame of him went abroad: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

16. And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

17. And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

18. And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was sick with the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

19. And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.

20. And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

21. And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?

22. But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said to them, Why reason ye in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Rise and walk?

24. But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick with the palsy,) I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy house.

25. And immediately he arose before them, and took up what he had been laying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

26. And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

27. And after these things he went forth, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office: and he said to him, Follow me.

28. And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

29. And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of tax collectors and of others that sat down with them.

30. But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?

31. And Jesus answering said to them, They that are well need not a physician; but they that are sick.

32. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

33. And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

34. And he said to them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.

36. And he spoke also a parable to them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if so, then both the new maketh a tear, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.

37. And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.

38. But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.

39. No man also having drunk old wine immediately desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

## Luke 6

1. And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through grain fields; and his disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.

2. And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

3. And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they who were with him;

4. How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

5. And he said to them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

6. And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him.

8. But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.

9. Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?

10. And looking around upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored well as the other.

11. And they were filled with rage; and conferred one with another what they might do to Jesus.

12. And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

13. And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

14. Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,

16. And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.

17. And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;

18. And they that were tormented with unclean spirits: and they were healed.

19. And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went power out of him, and healed them all.

20. And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

21. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

22. Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.

23. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers to the prophets.

24. But woe to you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.

25. Woe to you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

26. Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

27. But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,

28. Bless them that curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you.

29. And to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.

30. Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.

31. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

32. For if ye love them who love you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.

33. And if ye do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

34. And if ye lend to them from whom ye hope to receive, what thanks have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much in return.

35. But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.

36. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

37. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

38. Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure it shall be measured to you again.

39. And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

40. The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one that is perfect shall be as his teacher. 

41. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye?

42. Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thy eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.

43. For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its own fruit. For from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush do they gather grapes. 

45. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

46. And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

47. Whoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:

48. He is like a man who built an house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.

49. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house on the earth; against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

## Luke 7

1. Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2. And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.

3. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

4. And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

5. For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

6. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:

7. Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

8. For I also am a man placed under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 

9. When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned himself about, and said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

10. And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well that had been sick.

11. And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and many people.

12. Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her.

13. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not.

14. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise. 

15. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.

16. And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet hath risen among us; and, That God hath visited his people.

17. And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the surrounding region.

18. And the disciples of John reported to him of all these things.

19. And John calling two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

20. When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

21. And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and afflictions, and of evil spirits; and to many that were blind he gave sight.

22. Then Jesus answering said to them, Go, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

23. And blessed is he, who shall not be offended because of me.

24. And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

25. But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.

26. But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he, concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

28. For I say to you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

29. And all the people that heard him, and the tax collectors, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

30. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him. 

31. And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

32. They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.

34. The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!

35. But wisdom is justified by all her children.

36. And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat.

37. And, behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

38. And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

39. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.

40. And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say it.

41. There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

42. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

43. Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.

44. And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

45. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

46. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.

47. Therefore I say to thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.

48. And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.

49. And they that were eating with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

50. And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

2. And certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,

3. And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance.

4. And when many people were gathered together, and had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:

5. A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.

6. And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.

7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.

8. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And his disciples asked him, saying, What doth this parable mean?

10. And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

11. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

12. Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

13. They on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

14. And that which fell among thorns are they, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

15. But that on the good ground are they, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

16. No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a lampstand, that they who enter in may see the light.

17. For nothing is secret, that shall not become evident; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come to light.

18. Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whoever hath, to him shall be given; and whoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. 

19. Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come near to him for the crowd.

20. And it was told to him by certain who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand outside, desiring to see thee.

21. And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God, and do it.

22. Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

23. But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.

24. And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid marvelled, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.

26. And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.

27. And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

28. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

29. (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.)

30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many demons had entered into him.

31. And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.

32. And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he permitted them.

33. Then the demons went out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.

34. When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.

35. Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

36. They also who saw it told them by what means he that was possessed by the demons was healed.

37. Then the whole multitude of the country of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear: and he went into the boat, and returned back again.

38. Now the man out of whom the demons had departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

39. Return to thy own house, and show what great things God hath done to thee. And he went away, and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done to him.

40. And it came to pass, that, when Jesus had returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

41. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him that he would come into his house:

42. For he had one daughter only, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he was going the people thronged him.

43. And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed by any,

44. Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stopped.

45. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

46. And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that power hath gone out of me.

47. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

48. And he said to her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace.

49. While he was yet speaking, there cometh one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.

50. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made well.

51. And when he came into the house, he allowed no man to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.

52. And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.

53. And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.

54. And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.

55. And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately: and he commanded to give her something to eat.

56. And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

## Luke 9

1. Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.

2. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

3. And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staffs, nor bag, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.

4. And whatever house ye enter into, there abide, and from there depart.

5. And whoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

6. And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.

7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John had risen from the dead;

8. And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen again.

9. And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

10. And the apostles, when they had returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

11. And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.

12. And when the day began to decline, then came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge, and get food: for we are here in a deserted place.

13. But he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.

14. For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

15. And they did so, and made them all sit down.

16. Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.

17. And they ate, and were all satisfied: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

18. And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who say the people that I am?

19. They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

20. He said to them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.

21. And he strictly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;

22. Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.

23. And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

24. For whoever will save his life shall lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

25. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?

26. For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in that of his Father, and of the holy angels.

27. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God.

28. And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up upon a mountain to pray. 

29. And as he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and shining.

30. And, behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah:

31. Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.

32. But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

33. And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.

34. While he was thus speaking, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

35. And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

36. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

37. And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, many people met him.

38. And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is my only child.

39. And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.

40. And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.

41. And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring thy son here.

42. And as he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all amazed at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,

44. Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

45. But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him concerning that saying.

46. Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.

47. And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,

48. And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.

49. And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.

50. And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.

51. And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

52. And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

53. And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.

54. And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?

55. But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

56. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

57. And it came to pass, that, as they were going in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.

58. And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head.

59. And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.

60. Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

61. And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go and bid them farewell, who are at my house.

62. And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 10

1. After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.

2. Therefore said he to them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

3. Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

4. Carry neither purse, nor sack, nor shoes: and greet no man by the way.

5. And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.

6. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

7. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.

8. And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:

9. And heal the sick that are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come near to you.

10. But into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of the same, and say,

11. Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: however be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come near to you.

12. But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

13. Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.

16. He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name.

18. And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.

19. Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

20. However in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.

21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

22. All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. 

23. And he turned himself to his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

24. For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

25. And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

27. And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

28. And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.

29. But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

30. And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

31. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

32. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

34. And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. And on the next day when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

36. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour to him that fell among the thieves?

37. And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise.

38. Now it came to pass, as they were going, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

39. And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.

40. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

41. And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art worried and troubled about many things:

42. But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

## Luke 11

1. And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.

3. Give us day by day our daily bread. 

4. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.

5. And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

6. For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? 

7. And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

8. I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.

9. And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

10. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

11. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he shall ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?

12. Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 

13. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

14. And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people marvelled.

15. But some of them said, He casteth out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons. 

16. And others, tempting him, sought from him a sign from heaven.

17. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.

18. If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.

19. And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

20. But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.

21. When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:

22. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour in which he trusted, and divideth his spoils.

23. He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.

24. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return to my house from which I came out.

25. And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

26. Then he goeth, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

27. And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts which nourished thee.

28. But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

29. And when the people were thickly gathered together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.

30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also shall the Son of man be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

32. The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.

33. No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a basket, but on a lampstand, that they who come in may see the light.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye: therefore when thy eye is clear, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thy eye is bad, thy body also is full of darkness.

35. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.

36. If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a lamp doth give thee light. 

37. And as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to eat.

38. And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.

39. And the Lord said to him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of greed and wickedness.

40. Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?

41. But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean to you. 

42. But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over justice and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone.

43. Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the best seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

44. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.

45. Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.

46. And he said, Woe to you also, ye lawyers! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. Woe to you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

49. Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:

50. That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

51. From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.

52. Woe to you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye have not centered in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 

53. And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:

54. Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. In the mean time, when there was gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they trampled one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.

3. Therefore whatever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

4. And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

5. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?

7. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

8. Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

9. But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

10. And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.

11. And when they bring you to the synagogues, and before magistrates, and powers, be not anxious how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

12. For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.

13. And one of the company said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

14. And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

15. And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.

16. And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

17. And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no place where to store my fruits?

18. And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I store all my fruits and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thy ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

20. But God said to him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? 

21. So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.

22. And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.

23. The life is more than food, and the body is more than raiment.

24. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?

25. And which of you by being anxious can add to his stature one cubit?

26. If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least, why are ye anxious for the rest?

27. Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

28. If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?

29. And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 

30. For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

31. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.

32. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell what ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which become not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

34. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

35. Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning;

36. And ye yourselves like men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.

37. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to eat, and will come forth and serve them.

38. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

39. And this know, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have allowed his house to be broken into.

40. Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.

41. Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or even to all?

42. And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?

43. Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

44. Truly I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.

45. But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunk;

46. The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in two, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. 

47. And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

48. But he that knew not, and committed things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom men have committed much, from him they will ask the more.

49. I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it is already kindled?

50. But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I constrained till it shall be accomplished! 

51. Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:

52. For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

53. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

54. And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, immediately ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

55. And when ye see the south wind blowing, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.

56. Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

57. Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

58. When thou goest with thy adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he drag thee before the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.

59. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart from there, till thou hast paid the very last mite.

## Luke 13

1. There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And Jesus answering said to them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?

3. I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 

5. I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

6. He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.

7. Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

8. And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

9. And if it shall bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.

10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

11. And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no way raise herself.

12. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity.

13. And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

14. And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

15. The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead him away to watering?

16. And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

17. And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

18. Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in its branches.

20. And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

22. And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.

23. Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said to them,

24. Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

25. When once the master of the house hath risen up, and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not where ye are from:

26. Then ye shall begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

27. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not where ye are from; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

28. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.

29. And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

30. And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.

31. The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go away, and depart from here: for Herod will kill thee.

32. And he said to them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.

33. Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!

35. Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and verily I say to you, Ye shall not see me, until the time shall come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath, that they watched him.

2. And, behold, there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy.

3. And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?

4. And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;

5. And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have a donkey or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?

6. And they could not answer him again to these things.

7. And he put forth a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the best places; saying to them,

8. When thou art invited by any man to a wedding, sit not down in the best place; lest a more honourable man than thou be invited by him;

9. And he that invited thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.

10. But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit eating with thee.

11. For whoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

12. Then said he also to him that invited him, When thou givest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

13. But when thou givest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:

14. And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

15. And when one of them that sat eating with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

16. Then said he to him, A certain man gave a great supper, and invited many:

17. And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were invited, Come; for all things are now ready.

18. And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them out: I pray thee have me excused.

20. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

21. So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind.

22. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.

23. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

24. For I say to you, That none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.

25. And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said to them,

26. If any man cometh to me, and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

27. And whoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he hath sufficient to finish it?

29. Lest perhaps, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

30. Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

31. Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

32. Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth a delegation, and desireth conditions of peace.

33. So likewise, whoever he is of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

34. Salt is good: but if the salt hath lost its savour, how shall it be seasoned?

35. It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. Then drew near to him all the tax collectors and sinners to hear him.

2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

3. And he spoke this parable to them, saying,

4. What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it?

5. And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

6. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7. I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.

8. Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loseth one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she findeth it. 

9. And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.

10. Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

11. And he said, A certain man had two sons:

12. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided to them his living.

13. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.

15. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

16. And he was longing to fill his belly with the husks that the swine ate: and no man gave to him.

17. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!

18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

19. And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.

20. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

21. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.

22. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:

23. And bring here the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:

24. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

25. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.

27. And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.

28. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father came out, and entreated him.

29. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither have I at any time transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:

30. But as soon as this thy son had come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.

32. It was right that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

## Luke 16

1. And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.

2. And he called him, and said to him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.

3. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.

4. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

5. So he called every one of his lord’s debtors, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?

6. And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 

7. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty. 

8. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.

9. And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends by the riches of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. 

10. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

11. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous riches, who will commit to your trust the true riches. 

12. And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?

13. No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches.

14. And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they mocked him.

15. And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

17. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail.

18. Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.

19. There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,

21. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

23. And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime didst receive thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

26. And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from there.

27. Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:

28. For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

30. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent.

31. And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

## Luke 17

1. Then he said to the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe to him, by whom they come!

2. It were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

3. Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother shall trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he shall repent, forgive him.

4. And if he tresspasses against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.

6. And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

7. But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to eat?

8. And will not rather say to him, Make ready something that I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunk; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

9. Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.

10. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.

11. And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:

13. And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

14. And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they were going, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

16. And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?

18. There are not found returning to give glory to God, except this stranger.

19. And he said to him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee well.

20. And when he was asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 

21. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. 

22. And he said to his disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.

23. And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.

24. For as the lightning, that lighteneth from the one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

25. But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

27. They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

28. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

29. But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

30. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day, he who shall be upon the housetop, and his furniture in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

32. Remember Lot’s wife.

33. Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

34. I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

35. Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

36. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 

37. And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

## Luke 18

1. And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

2. Saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, neither regarded man: 

3. And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.

4. And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

5. Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.

6. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

7. And shall not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night to him, though he beareth long with them?

8. I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

9. And he spoke this parable to certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 

10. Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.

11. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.

12. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

13. And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

14. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

15. And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

16. But Jesus called them to him, and said, Permit the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter into it.

18. And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, except one, that is, God.

20. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.

21. And he said, All these have I kept from my youth.

22. Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

23. And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

24. And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hard it is for them that have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

27. But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.

28. Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

29. And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

31. Then he took the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

32. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully treated, and spitted on:

33. And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.

34. And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

35. And it came to pass, that as he had come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

36. And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what it meant.

37. And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.

38. And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.

39. And they who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.

40. And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he had come near, he asked him,

41. Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

42. And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.

43. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

## Luke 19

1. And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

2. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, who was the chief among the tax collectors, and he was rich.

3. And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.

4. And he ran before, and climbed up upon a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.

5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.

6. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

7. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

8. And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.

9. And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

11. And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

12. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

13. And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come. 

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

15. And it came to pass, that when he had returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. 

16. Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

17. And he said to him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.

19. And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

20. And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

21. For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.

22. And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow:

23. Why then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest? 

24. And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

25. (And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

26. For I say to you, That to every one who hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him.

27. But those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.

28. And when he had thus spoken, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

30. Saying, Go ye into the village opposite you; in which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, on which yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him here.

31. And if any man shall ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

32. And they that were sent went, and found even as he had said to them.

33. And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them, Why loose ye the colt?

34. And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

35. And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus on it.

36. And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

37. And when he had come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;

38. Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

39. And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

40. And he answered and said to them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

41. And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

42. Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thy eyes.

43. For the days shall come upon thee, that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and surround thee, and keep thee in on every side,

44. And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

45. And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought;

46. Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.

47. And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

48. And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. 

## Luke 20

1. And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

2. And spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

3. And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:

4. The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?

5. And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

6. But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

7. And they answered, that they could not tell where it was from.

8. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

9. Then he began to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.

10. And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the vinedressers beat him, and sent him away empty.

11. And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

12. And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.

13. Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be when they see him they will reverence him.

14. But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?

16. He shall come and destroy these vinedressers, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, may that never be.

17. And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?

18. Whoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

19. And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

20. And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who pretended to be righteous men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.

21. And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: 

22. Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

23. But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why tempt ye me?

24. Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.

25. And he said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the things which are God’s.

26. And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

27. Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

28. Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If any man’s brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

29. There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.

30. And the second took her for a wife, and he died childless.

31. And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.

32. Last of all the woman died also.

33. Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her for a wife.

34. And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:

35. But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:

36. Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.

37. Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.

39. Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.

40. And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.

41. And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?

42. And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

43. Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.

44. David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

45. Then in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;

47. Who devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater condemnation.

## Luke 21

1. And he looked up, and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.

2. And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in there two mites.

3. And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:

4. For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her poverty hath cast in all the living that she had.

5. And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,

6. As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

7. And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?

8. And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: therefore go ye not after them. 

9. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not yet.

10. Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:

11. And great earthquakes shall be in various places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

12. But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.

13. And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

14. Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:

15. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to speak against nor withstand.

16. And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.

17. And ye shall be hated by all men for my name’s sake.

18. But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

19. In your patience possess ye your souls.

20. And when ye shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation is near.

21. Then let them who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them who are in the midst of it depart from it; and let not them that are in the countries enter into it.

22. For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

23. But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

24. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled.

25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

26. Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for expectation of those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

27. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth near.

29. And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;

30. When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand.

31. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near at hand.

32. Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.

33. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

34. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with dissipation, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

35. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

36. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.

38. And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover.

2. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.

3. Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

4. And he went his way, and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.

5. And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

6. And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude. 

7. Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.

8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat.

9. And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

10. And he said to them, Behold, when ye have entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth.

11. And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Master saith to thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.

13. And they went, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.

14. And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

15. And he said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: 

16. For I say to you, I will not any more eat of it, until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and share it among yourselves:

18. For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

19. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.

20. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

21. But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

22. And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!

23. And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

24. And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.

25. And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.

26. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

27. For who is greater, he that eateth, or he that serveth? is not he that eateth? but I am among you as he that serveth.

28. Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations.

29. And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me;

30. That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

33. And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.

34. And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou shalt three times deny that thou knowest me.

35. And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and sack, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

36. Then said he to them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his sack: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

37. For I say to you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

38. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.

39. And he came out, and went, as he was accustomed, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

40. And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

41. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

42. Saying, Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. 

43. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.

44. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.

45. And when he rose up from prayer, and had come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

46. And said to them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

47. And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.

48. But Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

49. When they who were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

50. And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. And Jesus answered and said, Permit ye even this. And he touched his ear, and healed him.

52. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, who had come to him, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staffs?

53. When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

54. Then they took him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.

55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard, and were seated together, Peter sat down among them.

56. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

57. And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

58. And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Surely this man also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.

60. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crowed.

61. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me three times.

62. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

63. And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

64. And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?

65. And many other things blasphemously they spoke against him.

66. And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,

67. Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:

68. And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

69. After this shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.

70. Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.

71. And they said, What need have we of any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

3. And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

4. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.

5. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee to this place.

6. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean.

7. And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.

8. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he had been for a long time, desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.

9. Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.

10. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

11. And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

12. And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

13. And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

14. Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man concerning those things of which ye accuse him:

15. No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done to him.

16. I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

17. (For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast.)

18. And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:

19. (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

20. Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.

21. But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

22. And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.

23. And they were insistent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

24. And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 

25. And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

26. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

27. And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.

28. But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

29. For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nursed.

30. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

31. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?

32. And two others, who were malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.

33. And when they had come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 

34. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

35. And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them mocked him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.

36. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

37. And saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.

38. And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.

40. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

42. And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.

43. And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

44. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 

45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the midst.

46. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

47. Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

48. And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

49. And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

50. And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:

51. (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

52. This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

53. And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, where man was never before laid.

54. And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

55. And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

56. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.

2. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

3. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

5. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 

6. He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,

7. Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

8. And they remembered his words,

9. And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

10. It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.

11. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

12. Then Peter arose, and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.

13. And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about sixty furlongs.

14. And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

15. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

16. But their eyes were restrained that they should not know him.

17. And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

18. And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?

19. And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

20. And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.

21. But we hoped that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

22. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulchre;

23. And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.

24. And certain of them who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

25. Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:

26. Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?

27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

28. And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would go further.

29. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

30. And it came to pass, as he sat eating with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 

32. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

33. And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

34. Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

35. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known to them in breaking of bread.

36. And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be to you.

37. But they were terrified and trembled, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

38. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

40. And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.

41. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any thing to eat?

42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

43. And he took it, and ate before them.

44. And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

45. Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,

46. And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

47. And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. And ye are witnesses of these things.

49. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye are endued with power from on high.

50. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

51. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

52. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

53. And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
