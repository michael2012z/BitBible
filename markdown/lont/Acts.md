# Acts

## Acts 1

1. The former narrative I composed, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began to do and teach,

2. even to the day in which he was taken up, after he had, by the Holy Spirit, given charge to the Apostles, whom he had chosen.

3. To whom, also, he presented himself alive, after his sufferings, by many infallible proofs; being seen by them forty days, and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.

4. And having assembled them together, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard from me.

5. For John, indeed, immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit, within a few days.

6. They, therefore, being assembled together, asked him, saying, Lord, wilt thou, at this time, restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. But he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has reserved to himself.

8. But you shall receive power by the Holy Spirit coming upon you, and shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth.

9. And, having said these things, while they beheld, he was lifted up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.

10. And while they were steadfastly looking up to heaven, as he ascended, behold two men in white raiment stood near them;

11. who also said, Galileans, why do you stand gazing up to heaven? This Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall also come in the same manner as you have seen him going to heaven.

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey.

13. And when they were come into the city, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon, the Zealot, and Judas, brother of James.

14. These all unanimously persevered in prayer, with the women, and with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

15. And in these days, Peter, rising up in the midst of the disciples, (now the number of persons assembled was about a hundred and twenty,) said

16. Brethren, it was necessary this scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit formerly spoke, by the mouth of David, with respect to Judas, who became the guide of those that apprehended Jesus:

17. (for he was numbered with us, and had obtained a part of this ministry:)

18. this man, therefore, purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling down on his face, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out:

19. and it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that field is called, in their language, Aceldama, that is, The Field of Blood.

20. «For it is written in the book of Psalms,'Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it': and,» 'Let another take his office.'

21. It is necessary, therefore, that one of the men who have continued with us all the time the Lord Jesus was conversant among us,

22. commencing from his immersion by John, until the day of his assumption, should be constituted a witness with us, of his resurrection.

23. And they set up two men, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And they prayed, saying, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show which of these two thou hast chosen,

25. that he may take part of the ministry and apostleship, from which Judas fell by transgression, that he might goes to his own place.

26. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all unanimously assembled in the same place:

2. and, on a sudden, there was a sound from heaven, as of a rushing violent wind; and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And there appeared to them tongues resembling fire, distinctly separated, and it rested upon each of them,

4. and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5. Now there were sojourning in Jerusalem pious men; Jews from every nation under heaven;

6. and when this report came abroad, the multitude assembled, and were confounded; for every one heard them speaking in his own dialect.

7. And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another, Behold! are not all these that speak, Galileans?

8. And how do we every one hear in his own native language:

9. Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those that inhabit Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,

10. Phrygia, and Pamphilia, Egypt, and the parts of Africa which are about Cyrene: Roman strangers, also, both Jews and proselytes;

11. Cretes, and Arabians; we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God!

12. And they were all in amazement and perplexity, and said one to another, What can this mean?

13. But others, mocking, said, Surely these men are filled with sweet wine.

14. But, Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice, and said to them-Jews, and all you that sojourn in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and attend to my words;

15. for these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is but the third hour of the day:

16. but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel,

17. «And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out a portion of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters shall prophesy; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.»

18. Yes, in those days I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants, and upon my handmaids; and they shall prophesy;

19. and I will give prodigies in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood and fire, and a cloud of smoke:

20. the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and illustrious day of the Lord come.

21. «And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall invoke the name of the Lord shall be saved.»

22. Israelites, hear these words: Jesus, the Nazarene, a man recommended to you by God, by powerful operations, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, (as you yourselves also know,)

23. him you have apprehended, being given up by the declared counsel and foreknowledge of God, and by the hands of sinners have crucified and slain:

24. whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was impossible that he should be held under it.

25. «For David says, concerning him,» 'I have regarded the Lord as always before me; because he is at my right hand, that I might not be moved:'

26. for this reason my heart is glad, and my tongue exults; moreover, too, my flesh shall rest in hope

27. that thou wilt not leave my soul in the unseen world, neither wilt thou permit thy Holy One to see corruption.

28. «Thou hast made me to know the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.»

29. Brethren, permit me to speak freely to you concerning the patriarch David; the he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is among us to this day;

30. therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins he would raise up the Messiah to sit on his throne;

31. he, foreseeing this, spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that his soul should not be left in the unseen world, nor his flesh see corruption.

32. This Jesus, God has raised up, of which all we are witnesses:

33. being exalted, therefore, to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has shed forth this, which you see and hear.

34. «For David is not ascended into heaven, but he says,» 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,'

35. till I make thy foes thy footstool.

36. Let, therefore, all the house of Israel assuredly know, that God has made this Jesus, whom you have crucified, Lord and Messiah.

37. Now, when they heard these things, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter, and the rest of the Apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?

38. And Peter said to them, Reform, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ, in order to the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off; as many as the Lord our God shall call.

40. And with many other words he testified, and exhorted, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.

41. They, therefore, who received his word with readiness, were immersed: and there were added to the disciples that very day, about three thousand souls.

42. And they continued steadfast in the teaching, in the fellowship, in the breaking of the load, and in the prayers of the Apostles.

43. Fear also fell upon every soul, and many miracles and signs were wrought by the Apostles.

44. And all that believed were together, and had all things in common.

45. They also sold their possessions and effects, and distributed them to every one according to his necessity.

46. Moreover, they continued unanimously in the temple every day; and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with joy and simplicity of heart,

47. praising God, having favor with all the people: and the Lord daily added the saved to the congregation.

## Acts 3

1. Now, about that time, Peter and John went up to the temple, at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.

2. And a certain man, who had been lame from his birth, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those that entered into the temple;

3. who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, begged to receive alms.

4. But Peter, with John, looking steadfastly upon him, said, Look on us.

5. And he fixed his eyes upon them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. But Peter said, Silver and gold I have none, but what I have I give you: in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, rise up and walk.

7. And, taking him by the right hand, he raised him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones were strengthened.

8. And leaping up, he stood, and walked about, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking, and praising God;

10. and they knew him to be the same person who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.

11. And while he kept fast hold of Peter and John, all the people ran together to them, exceedingly astonished, in the portico called Solomon's.

12. And Peter, seeing this, answered the people, Israelites, why do you wonder at this? or why do you fix your eyes on us, as if by our own power, or piety, we had made this man to walk?

13. The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and rejected in the presence of Pilate, when he was desirous to release him:

14. but you rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;

15. and killed the Prince of Life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses;

16. and his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yes, the faith which is by him, has given him this perfect soundness, in the presence of you all.

17. And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers;

18. but those things which God foretold, by the mouth of all his prophets, that the Messiah should suffer, he has thus fulfilled.

19. Reform, therefore, and return to God, that so your sins may be blotted out; that seasons of refreshment may come from the presence of the Lord,

20. and that he may send Jesus Christ, who was before designed for you:

21. whom, indeed, heaven must retain till the time of the accomplishment of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, from the beginning of time.

22. «Moses truly said, to the fathers,» 'A prophet like me shall the Lord your God raise up for you, from among your brethren; him shall you obey in all things, whatsoever he shall say to you:'

23. «and it shall come to pass, that every soul who will not obey that prophet, shall be cut off from among the people.»

24. Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that succeeded, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.

25. «You are the children of the prophets, and of the institution which God instituted with our fathers, saying to Abraham,» 'And in your see shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'

26. To you, first, God, having raised up his Son, has sent him to bless you; in turning every one of you, from your iniquities.

## Acts 4

1. And while they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees, came upon them;

2. being grieved that they taught the people, and announced, through Jesus, the resurrection from the dead.

3. And they laid hands on them, and committed them into custody to the next day; for it was now evening.

4. But many of those who had heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.

5. And the next day their rulers, elders, and scribes, gathered together at Jerusalem:

6. both Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas; also John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the high priest's kindred.

7. And having set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have you done this?

8. Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel;

9. if we are this day examined about the benefit conferred on the impotent man, by what means he is healed;

10. be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that through the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God has raised from the dead: yes, by HIM this man stands before you hale.

11. This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders, that is become the head of the corner:

12. and there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we can be saved.

13. Now, when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and understood that they were illiterate men, and in private stations in life, they were astonished, and recollected their having been with Jesus.

14. And seeing the man that was cured standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

15. But having ordered them to withdraw out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

16. saying, What shall we do with these men? for that indeed a signal miracle has been wrought by them, is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and we can not deny it.

17. Nevertheless, that it may not spread any further among the people, let us charge them, with the severest threats, to speak no more to any man in this name.

18. And having called them, they charged them neither to speak nor teach any more in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John, answering them, said, Whether it be just in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge you:

20. for we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

21. And having threatened them again, they dismissed them, on account of the people, finding nothing for which they might punish them; because all the people glorified God for that which was done;

22. for the man on whom this miracle of healing was wrought, was more than forty years old.

23. And being dismissed, they came to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.

24. And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, thou art the God who didst make heaven and earth; and the sea, and all things that are in them:

25. «who didst say by the mouth of thy servant David,» 'Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?'

26. «The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers combined together against the Lord, and against his anointed.»

27. For of a truth, against thy holy Son Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the heathen, and the people of Israel,

28. have combined to do what thy hand and thy counsel marked out before to be done.

29. And now, O Lord, regard their threatenings; and give to thy servants to speak thy word with all freedom;

30. whilst thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are doing through the name of thy holy Son Jesus.

31. And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken: and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with freedom.

32. Now the heart and soul of the multitude of believers was one: nor did any one call any of his possessions his own; but all things were common among them.

33. And with great power did the Apostles give forth their testimony concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great kindness was among them all.

34. Neither was there one indigent person among them; for as many as were proprietors of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they sold,

35. and laid it down at the feet of the Apostles: and distribution was made to each according to his need.

36. And Joses, who, by the Apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which being interpreted, signifies a Son of Exhortation,) a Levite, and by birth a Cyprian,

37. having an estate, sold it, and brought the money and laid it down at the feet of the Apostles.

## Acts 5

1. But a certain man, named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold an estate,

2. and secreted a part of the price, his wife also, being privy to it: and bringing a certain part, he laid it down at the feet of the Apostles.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart, that you should attempt to impose on the Holy Spirit, and to secrete a part of the price of the land?

4. While it remained, did it not continue yours? and when it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you admitted this thing into your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.

5. And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired: and great fear fell on all that heard these things.

6. Then the young men arose, and bound him up, and carrying him out, they buried him.

7. After the interval of about three hours, his wife, also, not knowing what was done, came in.

8. And Peter said to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.

9. Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have conspired together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of those who have been burying your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out.

10. And immediately she fell down at his feet, and expired: and the young men coming in, found her dead, and carried her out, and buried her by her husband.

11. And great fear came on all the assembly, and on all that heard these things.

12. And many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles, (and they were all unanimously in Solomon's portico;

13. and not one of the rest presumed to join himself to them, but the people magnified them:

14. and believers were more and more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women:)

15. insomuch that along the streets they brought out the sick, and laid them on beds, and couches, that even the shadow of Peter, coming by, might overshadow some of them.

16. And multitudes also, out of the cities round about, came together to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those that were troubled with unclean spirits, who were all healed.

17. But the high priest arising, and all they that were him, being the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with zeal,

18. and laid their hands on the Apostles, and put them into the common prison.

19. But a messenger of the Lord, by night, opened the doors of the prison, and bringing them out, said,

20. Go, and presenting yourselves in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.

21. And hearing this, they went very early into the temple, and taught. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, they called together the Sanhedrim, even the whole Senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

22. But when the officers came, they found them not in the prison. Returning, therefore, they made their report,

23. saying, We found, indeed, the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing before the doors; but, having opened them, we found no one within.

24. Now, when the high priest, and the captain of the temple guard, and the chief priests heard these words, they doubted concerning them, what this could be.

25. But one came, and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

26. Then the captain went, with the officers, and brought them, (not by violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned:)

27. and when they had brought them, they set them before the Sanhedrim. And the high priest asked them,

28. saying, Did we not strictly charge you, that you should not teach in this name? and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring this man's blood upon us.

29. But Peter and the other Apostles answered, and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew, hanging him on a tree:

31. HIM has God exalted at his right hand, a Prince and Saviour, to give reformation to Israel, and remission of sins.

32. And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to them who submit to his government.

33. And when they heard this, they were enraged, and consulted to put them to death.

34. But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrim, whose name was Gamaliel, a doctor of law, in great esteem among all the people, rose up, and commanded the Apostles to be taken out for a little while;

35. and he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you are about to do to these men.

36. Some time ago Theudas arose, pretending himself to be a person of note: to whom a number of men, about four hundred, adhered, who was slain; and all who hearkened to him were scattered, and came to nothing.

37. After him, Judas, the Galilean, arose, in the days of the enrollment, and drew a multitude of people after him, and he was destroyed; and all who hearkened to him were dispersed.

38. And now, in the present case, I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this design and work be of men, it will be defeated;

39. but if it be of God, you can not defeat them: lest, perhaps, you be found fighters against God.

40. And they yielded to him; and having called in the Apostles, and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.

41. And they departed from the presence of the Sanhedrim. rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be exposed to infamy for the sake of his name.

42. And, daily, in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and declare the good news, that Jesus is the Messiah.

## Acts 6

1. Now, in these days, the number of the disciples being multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists that is, Jews who used the Greek language against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministrations.

2. And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples together, said, It is by no means agreeable, that we should leave the word of God to attend tables;

3. therefore, brethren, look out from among yourselves seven men of an attested character, full of spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this business;

4. we will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

5. And the speech was pleasing to all the multitude, and they elected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nichanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch;

6. whom they presented before the Apostles; and they, having prayed, laid hands on them.

7. And the word of God grew; and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was greatly multiplied; and a great multitude of the priests became obedient to the faith.

8. And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought many miracles, and great signs among the people.

9. Then there arose some of the synagogue, which is called that of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.

10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit with which he spoke.

11. Then they suborned men to say, We heard him speak reproachful words against Moses, and against God.

12. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and setting upon him, they dragged him away with them, and brought him to the Sanhedrim.

13. And they set up false witnesses, who said, This man is incessantly speaking against this holy place, and the law:

14. for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change its customs, which Moses delivered to us.

15. And all that sat in the Sanhedrim, fixing their eyes upon him, saw his countenance like the countenance of an angel.

## Acts 7

1. Then the high priest said, Are these things indeed thus?

2. And he said, Brethren, and fathers, hearken: the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran;

3. «and said to him,» 'Depart from your country and from your kindred, and come into a land which I will show you.'

4. Then departing from the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Charran: and from thence, after his father died, he caused him to remove his habitation into this land, in which you now dwell.

5. And he gave him no inheritance in it, not so much as the breadth of his foot: nevertheless he promised to give it for a possession to him, even to his seed after him, when he had no child.

6. «And God spoke thus-that his seed should» 'sojourn in a foreign land, and that they should enslave and abuse them four hundred years.'

7. «And the nation to which they are enslaved (said God) I will judge; and afterward they shall come out, and serve me in this place.»

8. And he gave him the institution of circumcision; and so he begot Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day: and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: nevertheless, God was with him,

10. and delivered him but of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he constituted him ruler over Egypt and all his house.

11. And a famine came upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction; and our fathers did not find sustenance.

12. But Jacob, hearing that there was corn in Egypt, sent our fathers first;

13. and the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and the family of Joseph was made known to Pharaoh.

14. And Joseph sent, and invited his father Jacob, and all his kindred, amounting to seventy-five souls.

15. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers:

16. and they were carried over to Sychem, and were laid in the sepulcher which Abraham purchased, for a sum of money, of the sons of Emmor, the father of Sychem.

17. And as the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt;

18. till another king arose, who knew not Joseph.

19. He, forming craft designs against our kindred, treated our fathers injuriously, by causing their infants to be exposed, that their race might perish.

20. In which time Moses was born, and was exceedingly beautiful; and he was bred up for three months in his father's house:

21. and being exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and nourished him for her own son:

22. and Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians: and he was mighty in his speeches and actions.

23. But when he was arrived at the full age of forty years, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.

24. And beholding one of them injured, he defended him; and smiting the Egyptian, he avenged him that was oppressed.

25. And he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would give them salvation by his hand: but they did not understand.

26. And the next day he showed himself to them, as they were quarreling, and would have persuaded them to peace, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you injure one another?

27. But he that injured his neighbor, thrust him away, saying, Who has made you a ruler and a judge or us?

28. Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian, yesterday?

29. Then Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian; where he begot two sons.

30. And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire, in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.

31. And Moses seeing it, admired the vision: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying,

32. «I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.» 'And Moses trembled, and did not dare to behold it.'

33. «And the Lord said to him,» 'Loose your shoes from your feet; for the place in which you stand is holy ground.'

34. «I have surely seen the evil treatment of my people, which are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them; and now, come, I send you into Egypt.»

35. This very Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who constituted you a ruler and a judge, God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer, by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.

36. He led them forth, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, for forty years.

37. «This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel,» 'A prophet like me shall the Lord God raise up to you from among your brethren; him shall you hear.'

38. This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai; and with our fathers, who received the lively oracles, to give to us.

39. To whom our fathers would not be obedient; but thrust him from them, and in their hearts returned back again to Egypt;

40. saying to Aaron, Make us gods who may march before us; for, as for this Moses, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.

41. And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

42. «So God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,» 'O house of Israel, did you offer victims and sacrifices to me for forty years in the wilderness?'

43. «And you have since taken up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God, Remphan; figures which you have made to worship: and therefore, I will carry you away beyond Babylon.»

44. The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, as he had appointed, who spoke to Moses to make it according to the model which he had seen:

45. which, also, our fathers receiving, brought in with Joshua into the possession of the heathen; whom God drove out from before the face of our fathers, until the days of David;

46. who found favor before God, and made it his petition to find a dwelling for the God of Jacob.

47. But Solomon built him a house.

48. Yet the Most High dwells not in temples made with hands: as says the prophet:

49. «Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what house will you build for me, says the Lord;»

50. or, what is the place of my rest? Has not my hand made all these things?

51. Oh! stiff necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do you.

52. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? yes, they slew those who spoke before, of the coming of that Righteous One, of whom you have now become the betrayers and murderers.

53. Who have received the law through ranks of messengers, and have not kept it.

54. And hearing these things, they were cut to the heart; and they gnashed their teeth at him.

55. But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looking up steadfastly toward heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.

56. And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.

57. But crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord.

58. And casting him out of the city, they stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen, invoking, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And bending his knees, he cried with a loud voice, O Lord, charge not this sin to their account. And when he had said this he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was well pleased with his slaughter. And at that time there was a great persecution against the congregation in Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the regions of Judea, and Samaria, except the Apostles.

2. And devout men carried away Stephen, and made great lamentation for him.

3. But Saul made havoc of the congregation, entering into houses, and dragging men and whom, whom he committed to prison.

4. Nevertheless, they who were dispersed, went about declaring the glad tidings of the word.

5. Then came Philip to the city of Samaria, and announced the Messiah to them.

6. And the people unanimously attended to the things that were spoken by Philip; as they heard them, and saw the miracles which he performed.

7. For, unclean spirits, which had possessed many, crying with a loud voice, came out of them; and many, who were paralytic and lame, were healed.

8. And there was great joy in that city.

9. But there was a certain man named Simon, who had, before, in that city, used magic, and astonished the nation of Samaria; pretending himself to be some extraordinary person:

10. to whom they all paid regard, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.

11. And they paid regard to him; because he had, for a long time, astonished them wit his enchantments.

12. But when they gave credit to Philip, declaring the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ: they were immersed, both men and women.

13. And Simon himself also believed; and being immersed, he kept near to Philip, beholding with amazement, the great and powerful miracles which were done.

14. Now when the Apostles, who were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John;

15. who, going down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

16. (For he was not yet fallen on any of them; only, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.)

17. Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the Apostles' hands, he offered them money,

19. saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.

20. But Peter said to him, Let your money go with you to destruction, since you have thought that the free gift of God might be purchased with money.

21. You have no part nor lot in this matter; for your heart is not upright in the sight of God.

22. Reform, therefore, from this your wickedness; and beg of God, if, indeed, the thought of your heart may be forgiven you;

23. for I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.

24. And Simon answered, and said, Make your supplications to the Lord on my behalf; that none of these things which you have spoken, may come upon me.

25. Now when they had borne their testimony, and had spoke the word of the Lord, they turned back for Jerusalem; and declared the glad tidings in many villages of the Samaritans.

26. And a messenger of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south, by the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.

27. And he arose, and took his journey; and, behold, a certain Ethiopian officer, a grandee of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, that was over all her treasure, who had come to worship at Jerusalem,

28. was returning, and sat in his chariot, reading the Prophet Isaiah.

29. And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach, and join yourself to this chariot.

30. And Philip, running up, heard him read in the Prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?

31. And he said, How can I, unless some one should guide me? And he requested Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

32. «Now the passage of scripture which he was reading, was this,» 'He was brought to the slaughter, as a sheep; and as a lamb before its shearer, is dumb; so he opened not his mouth.'

33. «In his humiliation his condemnation was extorted; and who shall describe his generation? for his life is cut off from the earth.»

34. The officer answering Philip, said, I beseech you, of whom does the prophet say this? -of himself, or of some other person?

35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from the scripture, told him the glad tidings concerning Jesus.

36. And as they went along the way, they came to a certain water, and the officer said, Behold, water; what hinders my being immersed?

37. OMITTED TEXT

38. And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the officer; and he immersed him.

39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly conveyed away Philip, and the officer saw him no more: so he went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip was found at Azotus; and going on thence, he proclaimed the glad tidings in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

## Acts 9

1. But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest,

2. and petitioned for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus; that, if he found any of that way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. And as he was proceedings on his journey, and was come near to Damascus, on a sudden, a light from heaven shone around him;

4. and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

5. And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute:

6. but arise, and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.

7. And the men who traveled with him, stood astonished; hearing, indeed, the voice, but seeing no one.

8. Then Saul arose from the earth; and, though his eyes were open, he saw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus.

9. And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.

10. Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, whose name was Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

11. And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus, whose name is Saul; for, behold, he is praying to me;

12. and he has seen in a vision, a man whose name is Ananias, coming in and laying his hand upon him, that he might recover his sight.

13. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many concerning this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;

14. and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy name.

15. But the Lord said to him, Go your way; for this man is to me a chosen vessel, to bear my name before nations, and kings, and the children of Israel:

16. for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name.

17. Then Ananias went, and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on the way, as you came, has sent me; that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

18. And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales; and he recovered his sight, and arose, and was immersed:

19. and having received food, he was strengthened, and for several days remained with the disciples at Damascus.

20. And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.

21. And all that heard him were astonished, and said, Is not this he who, in Jerusalem, spread desolation among them who called on his name; and came hither on purpose to carry such bound to the chief priests?

22. But Saul became stronger, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, evincing that this is the Messiah.

23. And, after many days, the Jews conspired to kill him:

24. but their design was made known to Saul; and they watched the gates, day and night, to murder him.

25. But the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.

26. And when he was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples; but they feared him, not believing that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas, taking him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way; and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly, at Damascus, in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them, coming in, and going out, at Jerusalem; and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.

29. And he spoke, and disputed with the Hellenists; but they attempted to kill him:

30. and the brethren, being informed of it, conducted him to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.

31. Then the congregations though all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, being edified, had rest; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the admonition of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.

32. Now it came to pass, that Peter, making a tour through all the congregations, came also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.

33. And he found there a certain man, whose name was Eneas, who has a palsy, and had kept his bed eight years.

34. And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus, the Messiah, heals you; arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.

35. And all the inhabitants of Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.

36. And there was at Joppa, a certain female disciple, named Tabitha, who, by interpretation, is called Dorcas; and she was full of good works, and alm-deeds, which she did.

37. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died. And when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.

38. And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, entreating him that he would not delay to come to them.

39. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping; and showing the coats and mantles, which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

40. And Peter putting them all out, kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise! And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.

41. And giving her his hand, he raised her up; and having called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.

42. And this was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.

43. And he continued many days at Joppa, in the house of one Simon, a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion that called the Italian Band,

2. a man of piety, and one that feared God, with all his house; giving, also, much alms to the people, and praying to God continually.

3. He evidently saw, in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius!

4. And having fixed his eyes upon him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms are come up, as a memorial before God.

5. And now send men to Joppa and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter:

6. he lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.

7. As soon as the messenger, who spoke to Cornelius, was gone, he called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier, of them that waited upon him;

8. and having related to them all these things, he sent them to Joppa.

9. On the next day, while they were on their journey, and drew near the city, Peter went up to the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.

10. And he was hungry, and would have taken a little refreshment; but while they were preparing, he fell into an ecstasy;

11. and he saw heaven opened, and something descending like a great sheet, fastened at the four corners, and let down to the earth:

12. in which there were all sorts of things, even four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air.

13. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter, kill, and eat.

14. But Peter said, By no means, Lord; for I have never eat anything which is common or unclean.

15. And the voice said to him again, the second time, Those things which God has cleansed, do not you call common.

16. And this was done three times, and the sheet was taken up again into heaven.

17. While Peter was pondering in himself, what the vision, which he had seen, might import; behold, the men, who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired out the house of Simon, stood at the door;

18. and calling, they asked, if Simon, whose surname was Peter, lodged there.

19. Now, as Peter was reflecting on this vision; the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are inquiring for you:

20. arise, therefore, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them.

21. Then Peter went down to the men, who were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am the man whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?

22. And they said, Cornelius, the centurion, a righteous man, who fears God, and has a character attested by all the Jewish people, has been instructed, by a holy messenger, to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.

23. Having, therefore, called them in, he entertained them, and the next day set out with them: and some of the brethren, who were of Joppa, went with him.

24. And the next day they entered into Caesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.

25. Now, as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and prostrating himself at his feet, made obeisance.

26. But Peter raised him up, saying, Arise; I also am a man.

27. And discoursing with him, he went in, and found many gathered together.

28. And he said to them, You know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to join with, or to come into the house of, one of another nation; nevertheless, God has shown me that I am to call no man common or unclean.

29. Wherefore, when I was sent for, I came without debate: I ask, therefore, on what account you have sent for me?

30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house; and, behold, a man stood before me in bright raiment,

31. and said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are remembered before God:

32. send, therefore, to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he lodges in the house of one Simon, a tanner, by the seaside; who, when he is come, shall speak to you.

33. Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things which God has given to you in charge.

34. Then Peter, opening his mouth, said, Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;

35. but, in every nation, he that fears him, and works of righteousness, is acceptable to him.

36. This is that message which he sent to the children of Israel; proclaiming the glad tidings of peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.

37. You know the report there was, through all Judea, which began from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached,

38. concerning Jesus of Nazareth; how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the region of the Jews, and in Jerusalem: whom they slew, hanging him on a tree.

40. This very person God raised up, on the third day, and granted him to become manifest;

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses before appointed by God, even to us, who have eat and drunk with him after he arose from the dead.

42. And he has given in charge to us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that it is he who is appointed by God, to be the judge of the living and the dead.

43. To him all the prophets bear witness, that every one who believes on him, shall receive forgiveness of sins by his name.

44. While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were hearing the word:

45. and they of the circumcision, who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished that the gift of the Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also:

46. for they heard them speaking in diverse languages, and glorifying God.

47. Then Peter answered, Can any one forbid water, that these persons should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?

48. And he ordered them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. And they entreated him to continue with them several days.

## Acts 11

1. Now the Apostles and brethren who were in Jerusalem, heard, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.

2. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they who were of the circumcision contended with him,

3. saying, You did go in to men who were uncircumcised, and did eat with them.

4. And Peter beginning, opened to them the matter in order, saying,

5. I was praying in the city of Joppa; and, in a trance, I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending from heaven, let down by the four corners, and it came close to me:

6. and looking attentively upon it, I observed, and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air:

7. and I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter, kill, and eat:

8. but I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.

9. And the voice answered me the second time from heaven, Those things which God has cleansed, do not you call common.

10. And this was done three times. And all the things were drawn up again into heaven.

11. And behold, at that instant, three men were come to the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.

12. And the Spirit commanded me to go with them, without any scruple: and these six brethren also went along with me. And we entered into the man's house:

13. and he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house, and saying to him, Send to Joppa, and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter;

14. who shall speak words to you, by which you and all your family shall be saved.

15. And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as on us at the beginning.

16. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John immersed in water; but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.

17. Since, therefore, God gave to them the same gift as he did to us, who had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I should be able to obstruct God?

18. And when they heard these things, they acquiesced, and glorified God; saying, God has, then, given to the Gentile also reformation to life.

19. Now, indeed, those who had been dispersed, on account of the distress which arose about Stephen, had traveled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews only.

20. Yet some of the, being men of Cyprus, and Cyrene; when they came to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, announcing the glad tidings concerning the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.

22. And the report concerning them came to the ears of the congregation that was at Jerusalem; and they sent Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch.

23. Who, when he was come, and beheld the favor of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all to adhere to the Lord, with full determination of heart;

24. for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith: and a considerable number were added to the Lord.

25. Then Barnabas went to Tarsus, to seek Saul;

26. and finding him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that they assembled with the congregation, for a whole year, and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first named Christians at Antioch.

27. And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. And one of them, whose name was Agabus, stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be a great famine over all the land: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.

29. And the disciples determined, that, according to the respective abilities of each, they should send to the assistance of the brethren who dwelt in Judea.

30. And this they did, sending it to the elders, by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. Now, about that time, Herod, the king, laid hands on some of the congregation, to afflict them.

2. And he slew James, the brother of John, with the sword.

3. And as he saw that this was acceptable to the Jews, he went on to seize Peter also: and it was in the days of unleavened bread;

4. and having seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to the custody of four quaternions of soldiers, intending, after the passover, to bring him out to the people.

5. In the meantime, therefore, Peter was kept in the prison; but earnest and continued prayer was made to God on his account, by the congregation.

6. And when Herod was ready to have brought him out, even that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.

7. And, behold, a messenger of the Lord presented himself, and a light shone in the house; giving Peter a blow on the side, he awoke him, saying, Arise quickly: and his chains fell off from his hands.

8. And the messenger said to him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals; and he did so. And he said to him, Throw your mantle round you, and follow me.

9. And going out he followed him; and he did not know that what was done by the messenger was real; but supposed that he had seen a vision.

10. And passing through the first and second watch, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city; which opened to them of its own accord. And going out, they went through one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him.

11. And Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know truly, that the Lord has sent his messenger, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all the expectations of the Jewish people.

12. And recollecting, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark; where many were gathered together, praying.

13. And as Peter knocked at the door of the outer gate, a maiden, whose name was Rose, went to inquire who was there.

14. And knowing Peter's voice, transported with joy, she did not open the gate: but running in, told them that Peter was standing at the gate.

15. And they said to her, You are distracted: but she confidently affirmed that it was so.

16. But Peter continued knocking; and when she opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.

17. And he made a sign to them with his hand to be silent; and related to them how the Lord had conducted him out of prison. And he aid, Inform James and the brethren of these things: and departing, he went to another place.

18. And as soon as it was day, there was no small tumult among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.

19. And Herod searching for him, and not finding him, examined the keeper, and ordered them to be led away to execution. and passing from Judea to Caesarea, he abode there.

20. And he was highly incensed against the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they unanimously came before him; and gaining Blastus, the king's chamberlain, to their interest, they begged for peace; because their country was nourished by that of the king.

21. And upon a set day, Herod, being arrayed in a royal habit, and seated upon the throne, made an oration to them.

22. And the people cried out, It is the voice of a God, and not of a man!

23. But immediately a messenger of the Lord smote him, because he did not give glory to God: and being eaten with worms, he expired.

24. And the word of God grew and was multiplied.

25. And Barnabas and Saul, having fulfilled their ministry, returned from Jerusalem; bringing along with them John, whose surname was Mark.

## Acts 13

1. Now, there were in the congregation that was at Antioch, certain prophets and teachers; particularly, Barnabas, and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius, the Cyrenian, and Manaen, who was educated with Herod, the tetrarch, and Saul.

2. And as they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate to me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.

3. And having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them; they dismissed them.

4. They, therefore, being sent by the Holy Spirit, departed to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus;

5. and being arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they had also John for their attendant.

6. And having traversed the island, as far as Paphos, they found a certain Jew, a magician and false prophet, whose name was Barjesus;

7. who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who calling for Barnabas and Saul desired to hear the word of God.

8. But Elymas, the magician, (for that was his name, when translated,) withstood them, endeavoring to turn away the proconsul from the faith.

9. Then Saul, (who is also called Paul,) being filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking steadfastly upon him,

10. said, O! full of all deceit, and of all wickedness! child of the devil! enemy of all righteousness! will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

11. And, behold, now the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, and not see the sun for a time. And, immediately, a mist and darkness fell upon him; and going about, he sought some to lead him by the hand.

12. Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed; being struck with the doctrine of the Lord.

13. And loosing from Paphos, they who were with Paul, came to Perga, in Pamphylia; but John withdrew himself from them, and returned to Jerusalem.

14. Nevertheless, they, going on from Perga, came to Antioch, in Pisidia: and entering into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.

15. And after the reading of the law and the prophets; the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to the people, speak it.

16. Then Paul stood up, and waiving his hand, said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, hearken.

17. The God of this people chose our fathers, and raised the people while sojourning in the land of Egypt; and led them out of it with an uplifted arm.

18. And for a space of about forty years, he endured their behavior in the wilderness.

19. And having cast out seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed their country to them for an inheritance.

20. And after these transactions, which lasted about four hundred and fifty years' he gave them judges, till Samuel the prophet.

21. And, from that time, they desired a king: and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the term of forty years.

22. «And, having removed him, he raised up to them David, for a king; whom also he extolled, and said,» 'I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who shall do all my will.'

23. Of this man's seed, according to the promise, God raised up to Israel, Jesus, the Saviour;

24. John having, to introduce his appearance, before he preached the immersion of reformation to all the people of Israel.

25. And when John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom do you imagine me to be? I am not He; but behold, there comes one after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.

26. Brethren, children of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God; to you is the word of this salvation sent:

27. for the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and their rulers, not knowing him, nor the sayings of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath day; have fulfilled them in condemning him.

28. And though they could find no cause of death in him; yet they requested Pilate that he might be executed.

29. And when they had accomplished all things that were written concerning him; taking him down from the cross, they laid him in a tomb.

30. But God raised him up from the dead:

31. and he appeared for several days to those that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.

32. And we bring you good tidings, that the very promise which was made to the fathers,

33. «God has accomplished to us, their children, in raising up Jesus: as it is also written in the second Psalm,» 'Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.'

34. «And because he has raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus,» 'I will give you the sure mercies of David.'

35. «Wherefore, also, in another place he says,» 'Thou wilt not permit thy Holy One to see corruption.'

36. Now David, having served his own generation according to the will of God; fell asleep, and was gathered to his fathers, and saw corruption.

37. But he whom God raised up, did not see corruption.

38. Be it known, therefore, to you, brethren, that by Him remission of sins is proclaimed to you:

39. and by Him, every one that believes is justified from all things; from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.

40. See to it, therefore, that what is spoken in the prophets may not come upon you:

41. «Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I perform a work in your days; a work which you will not believe, though one should distinctly declare it to you.»

42. Now, when going out, they requested that these words might be spoken to them, on the following Sabbath.

43. And when the synagogue was broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded them to persevere in the favor of God.

44. And, on the following Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together, to hear the word of God.

45. But the Jews, seeing the multitudes, were filled with zeal; and opposed the things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and reviling.

46. Then Paul and Barnabas, with great freedom of speech, said, It was necessary, that the word of God should first be spoken to you; but since you thrust it away from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life; behold, we turn to the Gentiles.

47. «For so the Lord has charged us, saying,» 'I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.'

48. And the Gentiles hearing this, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were disposed for eternal life, believed.

49. And the word of the Lord was published throughout all that region.

50. But the Jews stirred up some devout women of considerable rank, and the magistrates of the city; and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territories.

51. And they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.

52. But the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 14

1. And it came to pass at Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude, both of the Jews and of the Greeks, believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the minds of the Gentiles, and filled them with malignity against the brethren.

3. They, however, staid there a considerable time, speaking boldly for the Lord; who gave attestation to the word of his grace, and granted signs and miracles to be done by their hands.

4. So the multitude of the city was divided; and some were with the Jews, and others with the Apostles.

5. But, as a violent attempt was made, both by the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to assault and stone them;

6. they, having received intelligence of it, fled to Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the adjacent country:

7. and there they declared the glad tidings.

8. Now, there was a certain man at Lystra, disabled in his feet; so lame, from his birth, that he had never walked.

9. This man heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes upon him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed;

10. said, with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up, and walked.

11. And the multitude, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, saying, in the Lycaonian language, The gods are descended to us in the likeness of men.

12. And Barnabas they called Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.

13. And the priest of Jupiter, whose image was before the city, brought oxen, with garlands, to the gates; and would, with the multitude, have offered sacrifice to them.

14. But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, hearing of it, rent their mantles, and ran in among the multitude, crying out,

15. and saying, Men, why do you these things? We are your fellow-mortals, and are declaring the glad tidings to you, that you may turn from these vanities to the living God; who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all living things which are in them:

16. who, in former generations, permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;

17. though he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving us showers of rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.

18. And, saying these things, they, with difficulty, restrained the people from sacrificing to them.

19. But Jews came thither from Antioch and Iconium, and persuaded the multitude; and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.

20. But, as the disciples were gathered about him, he rose up, and entered into the city; and the next day he departed, with Barnabas, to Derbe.

21. And having declared the gospel to that city, and made a considerable number of disciples; they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,

22. confirming the souls of the disciples; exhorting them to continue in the faith, and testifying that it is necessary we should enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.

23. And when they had constituted elders for them, in every congregation, having prayed to God, with fasting; they committed them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.

24. And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

25. And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.

26. And they sailed thence to Antioch, whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for that work which they had accomplished.

27. And when they were come thither, and had gathered the congregation together, they related what God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. In the meantime, some, who came down from Judea, taught the brethren, Except you be circumcised, according to the manner of Moses, you can not be saved.

2. There being, therefore, a contention, and no small debate with them, on the part of Paul and Barnabas; they resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others of their number, should go up to the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem, about this question.

3. They, therefore, being brought forward on their journey, by the congregation, went through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they occasioned great joy to all the brethren.

4. And being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation, and by the Apostles and elders: and they related what things God had done with them.

5. But some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, rose up and said, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.

6. And the Apostles and elders were gathered together to consult upon this affair.

7. And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, you know that, some considerable time since, God among us, chose, that the Gentiles, by my mouth, should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

8. And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us:

9. and made no distinction between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.

10. Now, therefore, why do you tempt God by imposing on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?

11. But we believe that we are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they.

12. And the whole multitude kept silence, and attended to Barnabas and Paul; relating what signs and wonders God had done among the heathen, by them.

13. Then after they had done speaking, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me.

14. Simeon has been relating how God first looked down on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name.

15. And the words of the prophets harmonize with this; as it is written,

16. «After this, I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; yes, I will rebuild its ruins, and set it upright again:»

17. that the remainder of men may seek the Lord, even all the heathen upon whom my name is called,

18. «says the Lord,» 'who does all these things, known to him from the beginning.'

19. Wherefore, my judgment is not to disquiet those who, from among the Gentiles, are converted to God;

20. but to write to them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from that which is strangled, and from blood.

21. For Moses has, from ancient generations, those who preach him, in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day.

22. Then it seemed good to the Apostles and elders, and all the congregation, to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, chosen men from among themselves, namely, Judas, surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, men of principal account among the brethren;

23. writing by their hands these things: The Apostles, and elders, and brethren, to the brethren from among the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting:

24. Forasmuch as we have been informed that, some going out from among us, to whom we gave no commission, have troubled you with discourses, unsettling your minds, saying, that you must be circumcised, and keep the law:

25. we, being unanimously assembled, have thought proper to send you chosen men, with out beloved Barnabas and Paul;

26. men that have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. We have, therefore, sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you by word of mouth, the same things.

28. For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to impose no further burden upon you besides these necessary things;

29. that you abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from anything strangled, and from fornication: from which you will do well to keep yourselves. Farewell.

30. They, therefore, being dismissed, came to Antioch; and assembling the multitude, delivered the epistle.

31. And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation it brought.

32. And Judas and Silas, being also prophets themselves; in a copious discourse, exhorted and strengthened the brethren.

33. And, having made some stay, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the Apostles.

34. But Silas thought proper to continue there.

35. Paul also, and Barnabas, with many others, continued at Antioch; teaching and declaring the good word of the Lord.

36. And, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit the brethren in all the cities in which we have published the word of the Lord; and see how they do.

37. And Barnabas determined to take along with them John, surnamed Mark.

38. But Peter did not think proper to take with them that person who had withdrawn himself from them from Pamphylia; and went not with them to the work.

39. There was, therefore, a sharp fit of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along with him, sailed to Cyprus.

40. But Paul made choice of Silas, and departed; being commended to the grace of God, by the brethren.

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the congregations;

## Acts 16

1. and came to Derbe and Lystra; and, behold, a certain disciple was there, whose name was Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but of a Grecian father;

2. who had an honorable character given by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.

3. Him Paul would have to go forth with him: and took and circumcised him, on account of the Jews who were in those places: for they all knew his father, that he was a Greek.

4. And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to their custody the decrees, which were determined by the Apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.

5. The congregations, therefore, were confirmed in the faith, and increased in number daily.

6. And they went through Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, and being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;

7. when they were come to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia; but the spirit did not permit them.

8. And passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.

9. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There stood a certain Macedonia, entreating him, and saying, Come over to Macedonia, and help us.

10. And as soon as he had seen this vision, we immediately endeavored to go to Macedonia; assuredly inferring, that the Lord had called us to declare the gospel to them.

11. Setting sail, therefore, from Troas, we ran directly to Samothracia; and the next day to Neapolis;

12. and came thence to Philippi, which is a city of the first part of Macedonia, a colony: and we continued in this city for some days.

13. And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the side of the river, according to the custom, where was an oratory; and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled there.

14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, heard the discourse: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things which were spoken by Paul.

15. And when she was immersed, with her family, she entreated us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, enter into my house, and continue there. And she compelled us.

16. Now it came to pass, that as we were going to the oratory, we were met by a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of divination, who brought her owners much gain by prophesying:

17. the same, following after Paul and us, cried out, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who declare to you the way of salvation.

18. And this she did for several days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I charge you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And it went out that very hour.

19. But when her owners saw that the hope of their gain was gone; laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them to the market place, to the magistrates:

20. and having brought them to the generals of the army, they said, These men, who are Jews, mightily disturb our city;

21. and teach customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive and practice, being Romans.

22. And the populace rose up together against them; and the generals tearing off their garments, commanded them to be beaten with rods.

23. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.

24. Who, having received such a strict charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet fast in the stocks.

25. But at midnight, Paul and Silas having prayed, sung a hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them.

26. And, on a sudden, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prisoner were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the prisoners were loosed.

27. And the jailor, awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners were fled.

28. But Paul cried out, with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.

29. And he called for lights, and sprung in; and, being in a tremor, fell down before Paul and Silas;

30. and, bringing them out, he said, O Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

31. And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.

32. And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.

33. And taking them, that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and was immediately immersed, himself, and all his.

34. And having brought them into his house, he spread the table before them: and believing in the God, with all his house, he was transported with joy.

35. And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Dismiss those men.

36. And the keeper of the prison told these things to Paul, The generals have sent that you may be dismissed; now, therefore, go out, and pursue your journey in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, They have beaten us, who are Romans, publicly and uncondemned, and have cast us into prison; and do they now thrust us out privately? By no means: but let them come themselves, and conduct us out.

38. And the sergeants reported these words to the generals. And when they had heard that they were Romans, they were afraid:

39. and they came and comforted them; and conducting them out, requested that they would depart from the city.

40. And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.

## Acts 17

1. And taking their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica; where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. And according to Paul's custom, he entered in among them, and discoursed to them for three Sabbaths from the scriptures;

3. opening them, and evidently showing that the Messiah ought to suffer, and to rise from the dead; and that this is the Messiah, even Jesus, whom I declare to you.

4. And some of them believed, and adhered to Paul and Silas; besides, a considerable number of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the principal women.

5. But the unbelieving Jews, filled with zeal, gathered together some mean and profligate fellows, and making a mob, threw the city into a tumult; and assaulting the house of Jason, endeavored to bring them out to the people.

6. But not finding them, they dragged Jason, and some of the brethren to the magistrates of the city, crying out, These men, that have turned the world upside down, are come hither, also;

7. and Jason has privately received them. And all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.

8. And they alarmed the multitude and the magistrates of the city, when they heard these things.

9. And having taken security of Jason, and the rest, they dismissed them.

10. But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas, by night, to Berea: and when they came thither, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. Now these were of a more noble disposition that those of Thessalonica: for they received the word with all readiness of mind, daily examining the scriptures, whether those things were so.

12. Many of them, therefore, believed; both of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.

13. But as soon as some of the Jews of Thessalonica understood that the word of God was announced by Paul at Berea, they came thither, also, exciting the populace.

14. And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, as if he were to go by sea. But Silas and Timothy continued there.

15. And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens: and having received an order for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they set out.

16. Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit within him was strongly moved when he beheld the city enslaved to idolatry.

17. He therefore reasoned with the Jews and proselytes in the synagogue; and in the forum, daily, with those who met with him.

18. Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers opposed him. Others said, What would this babbler say? And others, he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities; because he declared to them the good news concerning Jesus and the resurrection.

19. And they took him and conducted him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by you?

20. for you bring some strange things to our ears; we would, therefore, know what these things mean.

21. For all the Athenians, and the strangers that sojourned among them spent their leisure in nothing else but in telling or hearing news.

22. Paul, therefore, standing up in the middle of Areopagus, said, Athenians, I perceive that you are exceedingly addicted to the worship of demons.

23. For, as I passed along, and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God: Him, therefore, you ignorantly worship, I announce to you.

24. The God who made the world, and all things that are in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands:

25. Neither is he served by human hands, as if he stood in need of anything; he himself giving to all, life, and breath, and all things.

26. And he has made of one blood, the whole race of men, to inhabit all the face of the earth; having marked out the times previously arranged in order, and the boundaries of their habitations:

27. that they might seek after the Lord, if possibly they might feel after him, and find him; though he be not far from every one of us:

28. «for in him we live, and are moved, and do exist; as some of your own poets have said-For we his offspring are.»

29. We, therefore, being the offspring of God, ought not to imagine the Deity to be like gold, or silver, or stone, wrought by the art and contrivance of man.

30. For though God overlooked the times of ignorance, he now makes proclamation to all men, everywhere, to reform;

31. because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by that Man whom he has ordained: of which he has given assurance to all men, by raising him from the dead.

32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some made a jest of it, and others said, We will hear you again upon this subject.

33. And this Paul went out of the midst of them.

34. Nevertheless, some men adhered to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius, the Areopagite; also a woman, whose name was Damaris; and others with them.

## Acts 18

1. After these things, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth;

2. and finding a certain Jews, named Aquila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla, his wife, (because Claudius Cesar had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he went to them.

3. And as he was of the same trade, he continued with them, and wrought; for by trade they were tent-makers.

4. But he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

5. And as soon as Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was impelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.

6. But when they set themselves in opposition, and reviled, he shook his garment, and said to them, Let your blood be upon your own head! I am pure. From henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.

7. And going out thence, he went into the house of one called Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.

8. Now, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed; and were immersed.

9. But the Lord said to Paul, in a vision by night, Fear not, but speak, and do not keep silence;

10. for I am with you, and no man shall fall on you, to injure you; for I have much people in this city.

11. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

12. But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made an assault upon Paul, with one consent, and brought him before the tribunal,

13. saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.

14. And when Paul would have opened his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice, or mischievous licentiousness, O Jews! it were reasonable I should bear with you.

15. But if it be a question concerning words, and names, and the law which is among you, you see to it yourselves; for I will be no judge of these matters.

16. And he drove them away from the tribunal.

17. And all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal; but Gallio did not concern himself at all about the matter.

18. And Paul still continued there for a considerable time, and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shaved his head at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.

19. And he arrived at Ephesus, and there he left them; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

20. And though they entreated him to have staid longer with them, he did not consent:

21. but he took his leave of them, saying, It is necessary for me, all means, to celebrate the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. And he set sail from Ephesus.

22. And landing at Caesarea, he went up; and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch.

23. and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch. And having spent some time there, he departed, going through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in a regular manner confirming all the disciples.

24. Now, a certain Jew, whose name was Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and powerful in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

25. This person was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught them things of the Lord with great accuracy, being only acquainted with the immersion of John.

26. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him aside, and explained to him the way of God in a more perfect manner.

27. And when he intended to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, exhorting them to receive him. And being arrived there, by his gift he greatly helped those who had believed.

28. For he strenuously debated with the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures, that Jesus is the Messiah.

## Acts 19

1. Now it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus: and finding there some disciples,

2. he said to them, Have you, on your believing, received the Holy Spirit? And they replied to him, No; we have not so much as heard whether the Holy Spirit is received.

3. And he said to them, Into what, then, were you immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.

4. And Paul said, John, indeed, administered the immersion of reformation, telling the people that they should believe in Him that was to come after him: that is, in Jesus.

5. And hearing this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And Paul, laying his hands, on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.

7. And they were, in all, about twelve men.

8. And he went into the synagogue, and discoursed with boldness, disputing for the space of three months, and evincing the things which related to the kingdom of God.

9. But as some were hardened, and would not believe, speaking reproachfully of this way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

10. And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.

11. And God wrought extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:

12. so that handkerchiefs, or aprons, were carried from his body to those who were sick, and the diseases removed from them, and the evil spirits came out.

13. And some of the strolling Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.

14. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.

15. But the evil spirit answering, said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?

16. And the man in whom the evil spirit was, sprung upon them, and getting master of them prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the house, naked and wounded.

17. And this was known to all the Jews, and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. And many of them, who believed, came and confessed, and made a declaration of their deeds.

19. And a considerable number of those who had curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all: and they computed the value of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver:

20. so powerfully did the word of the Lord grow, and prevail.

21. Now when these things were fulfilled, Paul proposed in spirit, that, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, he would go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, it is necessary for me also to see Rome.

22. And sending two of those that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself staid some time in Asia.

23. And there happened, about that time, no small tumult concerning that way.

24. For a man whose name was Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines of Diana, procured no small gain to the artificers:

25. whom he gathered together, with the workmen employed about the business, and said, Men, you know that our maintenance arises from this manufacture;

26. and you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded great numbers of people, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, and has turned them aside, saying that they are not deities which are made with hands;

27. so that there is danger, not only that this occupation of ours should be depreciated, but also that the people of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her grandeur destroyed; whom all Asia and the world worship.

28. And hearing this, they were filled with rage; and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!

29. And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging thither Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travelers.

30. And when Paul would have gone in to the people, the disciples would not permit him.

31. And some, too, the principal officers of Asia, as they had a friendship for him, sent to him, and desired that he would not venture himself into the theater.

32. Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another; for the congregation was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.

33. And they thrust forth forward Alexander, from amongst the multitude, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defense to the people.

34. But when they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about the space of two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!

35. But the chancellor, having pacified the people, said Ephesians, what man is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is devoted to the great Diana, and to the image that fell down from Jupiter.

36. Since, then, these things are incontestable, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing in a precipitate manner;

37. for you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.

38. If, therefore, Demetrius, and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, courts are held; and there are the proconsuls; let them implead together.

39. But if you are inquiring anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a legal congregation.

40. And, indeed, we are in danger of being called in question for the insurrection which has happened this day, as there is no cause by which we can account for this concourse.

41. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the congregation.

## Acts 20

1. Now, after the tumult was ceased, Paul, calling the disciples to him: and embracing them, departed to go into Macedonia.

2. And going through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came into Greece.

3. And when he had continued there three months, as an ambush was laid for him by the Jews, when he was about to embark for Syria, he thought it advisable to return by Macedonia.

4. And Sopater, the Berean, accompanied him as far as Asia; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius, of Derbe, and Timothy: and of the Asiatics, Tychicus and Trophimus.

5. These, going before, staid for us at Troas.

6. And we set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we continued seven days.

7. And on the first day of the week, when the disciples met together to break bread, Paul, being about to depart on the morrow, discoursed to them, and continued his speech until midnight.

8. And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which we were assembled;

9. and a certain young man, whose name was Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a profound sleep: and as Paul continued his discourse a long time, he was so overpowered with sleep that he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.

10. And Paul went down, and fell upon him, and taking him in his arms, said, Do not make any disturbance, for his life is in him.

11. And going up again, and having broken bread, and eaten, he conversed a considerable time, even till break of day, and so departed.

12. And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.

13. But we went before into the ship, and sailed to Assos, where we are to take up Paul, for so he had appointed, choosing himself to go on foot.

14. And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene,

15. And sailing thence, we came the next day over against Chios; and the day following, we touched at Samos, and having staid at Trogyllium, we came the day after to Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he earnestly endeavored, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.

17. But, sending to Ephesus, from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the congregation.

18. And when they were come to him, he said to them, You know how I have been conversant among you all the time, from the first day in which I entered into Asia,

19. serving the Lord, with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me by the ambushes of the Jews:

20. and how I have suppressed nothing that was advantageous, not neglecting to announce to you, and to teach you publicly and privately;

21. testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, reformation with respect to God, and faith with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the Spirit, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:

23. except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But I make no account of any of these things, nor do I regard even life itself; so that I may but joyfully finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, even to testify the good news of the favor of God.

25. And now, behold, I know that you all, with whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall not see my face any more.

26. Wherefore, I testify to you this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men.

27. For I have not declined to declare to you all the counsel of God.

28. Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has constituted you overseers; to feed the congregation of the Lord, which he has redeemed with his own blood.

29. For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will enter in among you, having no mercy on the flock.

30. Yes, from among your own selves men shall arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.

31. Watch, therefore, remembering that for the space of three years, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.

32. And now, brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his favor, who is able to edify you, and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.

33. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

34. Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those that were with me.

35. I have showed you all things; how, that thus laboring, you ought to assist the infirm, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is much happier to give than to receive.

36. And having said these things, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.

37. And there was great lamentation among them all: and falling upon Paul's neck, they kissed him;

38. especially grieving for that word which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.

## Acts 21

1. Now, as soon as we had withdrawn from them, and had set sail, we came with a direct course to Coos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.

2. And finding a ship passing over Phenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.

3. And coming within sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its freight.

4. And we continued there several days, finding disciples, who told Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.

5. But when we had finished these seven days, we departed, and went our way, and they all attended us out of the city, with their wives and children; and, kneeling down on the seashore, we prayed.

6. And having embraced each other, we went on board the ship; and they returned back to their own houses.

7. And finishing our course, we came from Tyre to Ptolemais, and embracing the brethren, we continued with them one day.

8. And on the next day we departed, and came to Caesarea, and entering into the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we lodged with him.

9. Now he had four virgin daughters, who were prophetesses.

10. And as we continued there many days, a certain prophet, whose name was Agabus, came down from Judea:

11. and coming to us, he took up Paul's girdle, and binding his own hands and feet, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. And when we heard these things, both we, and the inhabitants of that place, entreated him, that he would not go up to Jerusalem.

13. But Paul answered, What do you mean, thus weeping, and breaking my heart? for I am ready, not only to be bound; but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased; saying, The will of the Lord be done.

15. And after these days, making up our baggage, we went up to Jerusalem.

16. And some of the disciples also from Caesarea, went along with us, and brought us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, and old disciple, with whom we should lodge.

17. And when we were arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us with pleasure.

18. And the next day Paul entered in with us to James; and all the elders were present.

19. And having embraced them, he gave them a particular account of those things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.

20. And when they heard it, they glorified God, and said to him, Brother, you see how many myriads of believing Jews there are: and they are all zealous for the law.

21. Now, they have been informed of you, that you teach all the Jews, which are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, saying, that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.

22. What is it then? The multitude must, by all means, come together; for they will hear that you are come.

23. Therefore, do this that we say to you: there are with us four men who have a vow upon them;

24. take them, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that there is nothing in those things which they have heard of you; but that you yourself walk regularly, keeping the law.

25. As for the believing Gentiles, we have written, determining that they should observe none of these things; except it be to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication.

26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day, being purified with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till an offering should be offered for every one of them.

27. But as the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the populace into confusion, and laid hands upon him,

28. crying out, Israelites, help! This is the man that everywhere teaches all men contrary to the people, and to the law, and to this place; and has even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.

29. (For they had been seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they imagined that Paul had brought into the temple.)

30. And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and laying hold of Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.

31. And when they went about to kill him, word was brought to the commander of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in confusion:

32. who immediately took soldiers, and centurions, and ran in among them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.

33. Then the commander drew near, and took him; and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was, and what he had done.

34. And some among the multitude cried out one thing, and some another: and as he could not know the certainty, by reason of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.

35. But when he was upon the stairs, it came to pass that he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.

36. For the multitude of the people followed, crying out, Away with him!

37. But as Paul was going to be brought into the castle, he said to the commander, May I be allowed to speak to you? And he said, Can you speak Greek?

38. Are you not that Egyptian, who did, before these days, stir up a sedition, and led out into the wilderness four thousand murderers?

39. But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, of Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no inconsiderable city; and I entreat you, permit me to speak to the people.

40. And on his giving permission, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:

## Acts 22

1. Brethren and fathers, hear my apology, which I make to you now.

2. And when they heard, that he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, they rather kept silence;

3. and he said, I am, indeed, a Jew, born at Tarsus, in Cilicia, but educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, accurately instructed in the law of our fathers; being zealous for God, as you all are at this day:

4. who persecuted this way to the death; binding both men and women, and delivering them into prisons:

5. as also the high priest is my witness, and all the national senate: from whom also having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus; to bring those that were there bound, to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.

6. And it came to pass, that as I was on my journey, and was come nigh to Damascus, about noon, on a sudden a great light from heaven shone about me;

7. and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

8. But I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.

9. And they that were with me saw the light, indeed, and were terrified; but they did not distinctly hear the voice of him that spoke to me.

10. And I said, Lord, what shall I do? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told you of all things, which are appointed for you to do.

11. And as I could not see, by reason of the glory of that light; being led by those that were with me, I came to Damascus.

12. And one Ananias, a pious man according to the law, who had an honorable character amongst all the Jews at Damascus,

13. coming to me, and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And in that very hour, I looked up on him.

14. And he said, The God of our fathers, has chosen you to know his will, and to see that righteous person, and to hear a voice from his mouth:

15. because you shall be his witness, to all men, of those things, which you have seen and heard.

16. And now, why do you delay? Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins, invoking his name.

17. And it came to pass, that when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance:

18. and I saw him, saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem; for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.

19. And I said, Lord, they know I was imprisoning, and scourging in the synagogues, them that believed in thee;

20. and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and kept the garments of those who slew him.

21. And he said to me, Go your way, for I will send you afar off to the Gentiles-

22. And they heard him to this word, and they lifted up their voices, saying, Away with this fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live.

23. And as they were crying out, and were rending their garments, and casting dust into the air,

24. the commander ordered that he should be brought into the castle, saying, that he should be put to the question by scourging, that he might know for what cause, they raised such an outcry against him.

25. And as they binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion, who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man, who is Roman, and uncondemned.

26. And the centurion hearing this, went and addressed the commander, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.

27. And the commander came, and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.

28. And the commander answered, I obtained this freedom with a considerable sum of money. And Paul replied, But I was free born.

29. They, therefore, who were about to have put him to the question, immediately departed from him: and the commander was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

30. And on the next day, desiring to know certainly of what he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him; and commanded the chief priests, and all the Sanhedrim, to come together; and bringing Paul down, he set him before them.

## Acts 23

1. And Paul, looking attentively on the Sanhedrim, said, Brethren, I have, even to this day, lived in all good conscience toward God-

2. And Ananias, the high priest, commanded those that stood by him, to strike him on the mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, God is about to strike you, you whited wall! For do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet, in violation of the law, command me to be struck?

4. But they, that stood by, said, Do you revile the high priest of God?

5. «And Paul said, Brethren, I was not aware that it was the high priest; for it is written,» 'You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.'

6. Then Paul, perceiving that the one part was Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out, in the Sanhedrim, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope and resurrection of the dead, I am brought into judgment.

7. And on speaking this, there was a contention between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.

8. For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.

9. And there was a great clamor; and the scribes who were on the side of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit, or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.

10. And as a great disturbance arose, the commander, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.

11. And in the following night, the Lord, standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul; for as you have testified the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear testimony in Rome.

12. And when it was day, some of the Jews, entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves with a curse; saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

13. And they were more than forty, who had made this agreement.

14. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves m by a solemn anathema, not to taste anything till we have slain Paul:

15. now, therefore, do you, with the Sanhedrim, signify to the commander, that he bring him down to you, as if you would more accurately discuss what relates to him; and we are ready to kill him, before he can come near you.

16. But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul.

17. And Paul, calling one of the centurions to him, said, Conduct this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.

18. He, therefore, took and led him to the commander, and said, Paul, the prisoner, calling me to him, desired that I would bring to you this young man, who has something to tell you.

19. And the commander, taking him by the hand, and leading him into a retired place, inquired of him, What is it that you have to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have agreed together to ask you, that you bring down Paul to-morrow to the Sanhedrim, as if they would inquire something more accurately concerning him.

21. But do not be prevailed on by them; for there are more than forty of them, that lie in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by a curse, neither to eat nor drink, till they have killed him; and they are now ready, expecting this promise from you.

22. The commander, therefore, dismissed the young man, with a charge, Be sure you tell no man, that you have discovered these things to me.

23. And he called too him two of the centurions, and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, to go to Caesarea; and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen; by the third hour of the night;

24. and provide beasts to set Paul upon, and conduct him in safety to Felix, the governor.

25. And he wrote an epistle, the contents of which are in this copy:

26. Claudius Lysias, to his excellency, Felix, the governor, sends greeting:

27. This man was seized by the Jews, and had like to have been slain by them; when I came with a party of soldiers, and rescued him: and I have since learned, that he is a Roman.

28. And, desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before the Sanhedrim,

29. whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law, but to have nothing charged upon him worthy of death, or of bonds.

30. But when it was signified to me, that an ambush would be laid for the man, by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to declare before you, what they have against him. Farewell.

31. The soldiers, therefore, as it was commanded them, taking up Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. And the next day they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:

33. who, entering into Caesarea, and delivering the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.

34. And when he had read the letter, he asked of what province he was: and being informed that he was of Cilicia,

35. I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.

## Acts 24

1. And, after five days, the high, Ananias, came down, with the elders, and a certain orator, named Tertullus: and they made their appearance before the governor, against Paul.

2. And he being called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, As we enjoy great peace by your means, and as illustrious deeds are happily done to this nation, by your prudent administration;

3. we accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. But, that I may not further trouble you, I beseech you to hear us briefly, with your usual candor.

5. for we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world; and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

6. who has attempted to profane the temple; and whom we apprehended, and would have judged according to our law;

7. but Lysias, the commander, coming upon us with a great force, took him away out of our hands,

8. commanding his accusers to come to you; by which means, you may yourself, on examination, know the certainty of all these things, of which we accuse him.

9. And the Jews also gave their assent, saying, that these things were so.

10. Then Paul, after the governor had made a signal to him to speak, answered, Knowing that you, O Felix! have been for several years a judge to this nation, I answer for myself with the more cheerfulness;

11. since you may know that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem;

12. and they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making any insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues, or in the city:

13. nor can they produce any proof of the things concerning which they now accuse me.

14. But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call a sect, so worship I the God of our fathers; believing all things which are written in the law, and in the prophets;

15. having hope toward God, of that which they themselves also expect, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.

16. And upon this account, I exercise myself to have always a conscience without offense toward God, and toward men.

17. Now, after several years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:

18. upon which some Asiatic Jews found me purified in the temple; neither with multitude nor with tumult;

19. who ought to have been present before you, and to accuse me, if they had anything against me:

20. or let these themselves say, if, when I stood before the Sanhedrim,

21. they found any crime in me; unless it be with relation to this one word, which I expressed, when I stood among them-that, for the resurrection of the dead, I am judged by you this day.

22. And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias, the commander, comes down, I will take cognizance of the affair between you.

23. And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him, or coming to him.

24. And, after some days, Felix, coming the Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

25. And he reasoned concerning righteousness and temperance, and judgment to come, Felix, trembling, answered, Go your way for this time, and I will take some future opportunity to call for you.

26. And he hoped, also, that money would be given him by Paul, that he might be set at liberty: and, therefore, he sent the more frequently for him, and discoursed with him.

27. Now, after two years were ended, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus; and Felix, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, left Paul a prisoner.

## Acts 25

1. When Festus, therefore, was come into the province, after three days, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem;

2. and the high priest, and the chief among the Jews, appeared before him against Paul, and entreated him

3. that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying an ambush to kill him by the way.

4. But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would shortly set out for that place:

5. therefore, said he, Let those of you who are able, go down with me; and if there be anything criminal in this man, let them accuse him.

6. And, having continued among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting down on the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought.

7. And when he appeared, the Jews, who came down from Jerusalem, stood round about, bringing many heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove;

8. while he answered for himself-Neither against the laws of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar, have I committed any offense at all.

9. But Festus, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me, concerning these things?

10. But Paul said, I am standing at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you know perfectly well.

11. For, if, indeed, I have done wrong, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there is no fact of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to gratify them! I appeal to Cesar.

12. Then Festus, having spoken with the council, answered, Have you appealed to Cesar? To Cesar you shall go.

13. And when some days were passed, King Agrippa, and Bernice, came to Caesarea, to pay their respects to Festus.

14. And as they continued there many days, Festus laid before the king the case of Paul, saying, There is a certain man, left in bonds by Felix;

15. concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews, informed me, desiring judgment against him.

16. To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and be allowed an opportunity of making his defense, as to the crime laid to his charge.

17. When, therefore, they were come hither, I, without any delay, sat down on the tribunal next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.

18. Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;

19. but had certain questions against him, relating to their own religion, and about one Jesus, that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

20. But as I was dubious of the question relating to him, I said, that if he were willing, he should go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.

21. But Paul, appealing to be kept to the hearing of his majesty, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.

22. Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would willingly hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow you shall hear him.

23. The next day, therefore, Agrippa and Bernice, coming with great pomp, and entering into the place of audience, with the commanders and principal men of the city; at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.

24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you who are present with us! you see this man, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem, and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.

25. But I could not apprehend him to have done anything worthy of death; yet, as he himself has appealed to his majesty, I have determined to send him.

26. Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my master: wherefore, I have brought him out before you all; and especially before you, King Agrippa! that, after examination taken, I may have something to write:

27. for it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner, and not to signify the crimes alleged against him.

## Acts 26

1. Then Agrippa said to Paul, It is granted to you to speak for yourself. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defense.

2. I esteem myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defense before you, concerning all those things of which I am accused by the Jews;

3. especially as you are acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews: wherefore, I entreat you, that you will hear me with patience.

4. The manner of my life, from my youth, which, from the beginning, was spent among my own nation, in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews;

5. who knew me from the first, (if they would testify,) that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now I stand in judgment for the hope of that promise, which was made by God to our fathers:

7. to which promise, our twelve tribes, worshiping continually, night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.

8. Why should it be judged an incredible thing, by you, that God should raise the dead?

9. I, indeed, thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.

10. Which, accordingly, I did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests. And when some of them were killed, I gave my vote against them:

11. and frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.

12. With this view, I was going to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests;

13. at mid-day, on the road, King Agrippa, I saw a light from heaven, exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining about me, and those who traveled with me.

14. And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.

15. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.

16. But arise, and stand upon your feet, for to this purpose I have appeared to you, to ordain you a minister and a witness, both of the things which you have seen, and of those which I will hereafter show you:

17. delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles; to whom I now send you-

18. to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive forgiveness of sons, and an inheritance amongst the sanctified, through faith in me.

19. From that time, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:

20. but declared, first to them at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea; and then to the Gentiles, that they should reform, and return to God, performing deeds worthy of reformation.

21. On account of these things, the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to have killed me with their own hands.

22. Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I continue, till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses have declared would be;

23. that the Messiah would be a sufferer-would be first of a resurrection from the dead-would give light to the people, and to the Gentiles.

24. And as he was thus making his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice, Paul, you are distracted: much learning drives you to madness.

25. But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but utter the words of truth and soberness.

26. For the king knows of these things; to whom, also, I speak with freedom: for I am persuaded none of these things are hid from him, for this was not done in a corner.

27. King Agrippa! do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.

28. Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to be a Christian.

29. And Paul said, I would to God that, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these chains.

30. And as he said this, the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.

31. And when they had retired, they spoke one with another, saying, This man has done nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.

32. And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar.

## Acts 27

1. And as it was determined that we should set sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and some other prisoners, to a centurions of the Augustan Band, whose name was Julius.

2. And going on board a ship of Adramyttis, we weighed anchor, intending to sail by the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus, a Macedonian, of Thessalonica, being with us.

3. And the next day we reached Sidon: and Julius, treating Paul with great humanity, permitted him to go to his friends, and to enjoy the benefit of their care.

4. And weighing anchor thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

5. And sailing through the sea over against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

6. And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.

7. And when we had sailed slowly for several days, and were hardly got over against Cnidus, the wind now permitting us; we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone:

8. and passing it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called the Fair Havens, in the neighborhood of which, was the city of Lasea.

9. And, as much time was spent, and sailing was now hazardous, because the fast was already over, Paul exhorted them,

10. saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be attended with injury and great damage, not only to the lading and to the ship, but also to our lives.

11. But the centurion paid greater regard to the pilot, and the master of the vessel, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.

12. And as the haven was not commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence, if they might possibly reach Phenice, to winter there;

13. which is a haven of Crete, looking to the southwest and northwest: and as the south win blew gently, supposing they were secure of their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close to Crete.

14. But not long after, there arose against her a tempestuous wind, which is called Euroclydon.

15. And as the ship was violently hurried away, and was not able to bear up against the wind, we gave her up, and were driven.

16. An running under a certain island, called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:

17. which, when they had hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing, lest they should fall upon the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven.

18. And we were exceedingly tossed by the storm, the next day they lightened the ship:

19. and the third day we cast out, with our own hands, the tackling of the ship.

20. Now, as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest pressed upon us, all remainder of hope that we might be delivered, was taken away.

21. And when there was great want of food, then Paul, standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, you ought to have hearkened to me, and not to have loosed from Crete, and incurred this injury and loss.

22. Nevertheless, even now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any life among you; but only of the ship.

23. For there appeared to me this night, an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I worship,

24. saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be presented before Cesar; and, behold, God has given you all them that sail with you.

25. Wherefore, take courage, men; for I trust in God that it shall be so, even as it was told me.

26. But we must be cast upon a certain island.

27. And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were tossed up and down in the Adriatic sea, the mariners suspected, about midnight that they drew near to some land;

28. and sounding, they found it twenty fathoms: and having gone a little way from thence, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms.

29. And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky shore, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished that the day would break.

30. But when the mariners endeavored to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense that they were about to carry out anchors from the ship-head;

31. Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these continue in the ship, you can not be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut off the cords of the boat, and let it fall off.

33. And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take some food, saying, Today, whilst waiting for this fourteenth day, you continue fasting, having taken nothing.

34. I exhort you, therefore, to take a refreshment; for this is conducive to your safety: for not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.

35. And when he had spoke thus, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God, before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.

36. And being all encouraged, they also took some food.

37. And we were in the ship, in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.

38. And being satisfied with food, they lightened the ship; and cast the corn into the sea.

39. And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they perceived a certain creek, with a shore, into which they determined, if they were able, to force the ship.

40. And having cut off the anchors, leaving them in the sea, they, at the same time, loosing the rudder bands, and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, pressed toward the shore.

41. But falling on a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground, and the fore part stuck fast, and remained immovable, while the hinder part was broken by the force of the waves.

42. And the counsel of the soldiers was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away, and escape.

43. But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, to throw themselves out first, into the sea, and get away to land:

44. and the remainder, some upon planks, and others upon some of the things of the ship. And so it happened that they all got safe to land.

## Acts 28

1. And being got safe to land, they then knew that the island was called Melita.

2. And the barbarians treated us with uncommon humanity; for having kindled a fire, they brought us all to it, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.

3. Now, as Paul was gathering up a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming out of the heat, fastened upon his hand.

4. And as soon as the barbarians saw the fierce animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom justice has not permitted to live, though he be saved from the sea.

5. But he, shaking off the fierce animal into the fire, suffered no evil.

6. However, they expected that he should have swollen, or suddenly have fallen down dead: and having waited a considerable time, and seeing no mischief befall him, changing their minds, they said he was a god.

7. And in the neighborhood of that place, there was the estate of the chief of the island, whose name was Publius; who, having received us into his house, entertained us in a courteous manner for three days.

8. And so it was, that the father of Publius, being seized with a fever and bloody flux, was confined to his bed: to whom Paul going in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.

9. Now, therefore, when this miracle was wrought, the rest also, who had disorders, in the island, came, and were healed.

10. Who also honored us with great honors; and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary.

11. And after three months, we departed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

12. And being arrived at Syracuse, we continued there three days.

13. From thence we coasted round, and came over against Rhegium. And after one day the south wind arising, we came, in two days, to Puteoli:

14. where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days: and so we went for Rome.

15. And from thence, the brethren, having heard of our affairs, came out to meet us, as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns: whom, when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

16. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the band: but Paul was permitted to dwell apart, in a house of his own, with a soldier that guarded him.

17. And it came to pass, that, after three days, Paul called together those that were the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing contrary to the people, nor to our paternal customs, yet I was delivered a prisoner, from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans;

18. who, having examined me, were willing to have set me at liberty, as there was no cause of death in me.

19. But when the Jews opposed, I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; not as having anything of which to accuse my own nation.

20. For this reason, therefore, I entreated, that I might see and speak with you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.

21. And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you; nor have any of the brethren, that have come hither, related, or said, any evil concerning you.

22. But we desire to hear from you, what you think; for as concerning this sect, we know that it everywhere spoken against.

23. And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things that relate to Jesus; both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.

24. And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken; and some believed not.

25. And disagreeing with each other, they broke up the assembly: Paul saying this one word, Surely, well did the Holy Spirit speak, by Isaiah the prophet, to our fathers,

26. «when he said,» 'Go to this people and say, Hearing you will hear, and will not understand; and seeing you will see, and will not perceive:'

27. «for the heart of this people is become gross, and with their ears they hear heavily; and they have drawn their eyes together, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.»

28. Therefore be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.

29. And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debates among themselves.

30. But Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all who came to him;

31. announcing the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, and without any restraint.
