## 3 John 1

1. The elder, to Gaius, the beloved, whom I love in the truth.

2. Beloved, I pray, that with respect to all things, you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.

3. For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came, and bore witness to your truth, even as you walk in truth.

4. I have no greater joy than that which I have when I hear my children are walking in truth.

5. Beloved, you do faithfully what you perform for the brethren, and for the strangers.

6. These have borne testimony to your love, in the presence of the congregation; whom, if you help forward on their journey, in a manner worthy of God, you will do well.

7. Because for his name's sake, they went forth, receiving nothing from the Gentiles.

8. We, therefore, ought to entertain such, that we may be joint laborers in the truth.

9. I wrote to the congregation: but Diotrephes, who affects a pre-eminence among them, does not receive us.

10. For this cause, when I come, I will bring his deeds to remembrance, which he practices-prating against us with malicious words; and, not content with this, he does not himself receive the brethren, and forbids them who would, and casts them out of the congregation.

11. Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good, is of God; but he who does evil, has not seen God.

12. Testimony is borne to Demetrius, by all, and by the truth itself; and we also bear testimony; and you know that our testimony is true.

13. I have many things to write; but I do not incline to write them to you with pen and ink:

14. for I hope immediately to see you, and so we shall speak face to face. Salute the friends by name.
