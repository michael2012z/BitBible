# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians, which is in God, our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ:

2. Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We are bound to thank God always, concerning you, brethren, as it is fit, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds;

4. so that we ourselves boast of you to the congregations of God, on account of your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions, which you endure;

5. a proof of the righteous judgment of God, that you might be counted truly worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you thus suffer:

6. seeing it is just with God to return affliction to them who afflict you-

7. and to you, the afflicted, (because our testimony was believed by you,) rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire,

8. inflicting a just retribution on those who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;

9. who shall suffer a just punishment-an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power-

10. in that day when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired by all the believers.

11. In relation to which, we are always praying concerning you, that our God may account you worthy of this calling, and fill you with all the benevolence of goodness, and the effect of faith with power;

12. that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the favor of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. Now, we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,

2. that you be not suddenly shaken in mind, nor alarmed, neither by spirit, not by report, nor by letter, as from us, intimating that the day of the Lord is at hand.

3. Let no one lead you into a mistake by any means; because the apostasy must first appear, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, must be first revealed,

4. who opposes and exalts himself against every one called a god, or an object of worship; so that he places himself in the temple of God, openly exhibiting himself, that he is a god.

5. Do you not remember that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?

6. And you know what now prevents his being revealed until his proper time.

7. For already the mystery of iniquity secretly works, only till he who now restrains, be taken out of the way;

8. and then shall that lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume by the spirit of his mouth-with the brightness of his coming,

9. he will, indeed, utterly destroy him, whose coming is according to the energy of Satan, with all the power, and signs, and wonders of falsehood;

10. and with all the deceit of unrighteousness among the destroyed; because they did not embrace the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

11. For this cause, God will send them strong delusion, that they may believe a lie;

12. that all may be condemned who have not believed the truth, but have taken pleasure in iniquity.

13. But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has, from the beginning, chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of spirit, and belief of truth;

14. to which he called you, by our gospel, that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. Well, then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the traditions which you have been taught, whether by our word or letter.

16. And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through favor,

17. comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may rapidly spread, and be glorified, even as among you.

2. And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will establish and keep you from the evil one.

4. For we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do, and will do, the things which we command you.

5. And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.

6. Now, we command you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which he received from us.

7. For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us-that we did not walk disorderly among you;

8. but with labor and toil we wrought night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you.

9. Not because we have not a right, but that we might give ourselves to you for a pattern, to imitate us.

10. And, therefore, when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any one will not work, neither let him eat.

11. For we hear that there are some who still walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but prying into other people's affairs.

12. Now, them who are such, we command and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

13. And you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

14. Now, if one do not obey our command in this letter, point out that man, and keep no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

15. Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

16. And may the Lord of peace himself give you peace always, in every event. The Lord be with you all.

17. The salutation of Paul, with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: thus I write.

18. The favor of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
