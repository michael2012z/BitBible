# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of those things, which have been accomplished amongst us,

2. as they, who were from the beginning, eye-witnesses, and afterwards ministers of the word, delivered them to us;

3. I have also determined, having exactly traced everything from the first, to write a particular account for you, most excellent Theophilus;

4. that you might know the certainty of those matters wherein you have been instructed.

5. In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah; and his wife, named Elizabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron.

6. They were both righteous before God, blameless observers of all the Lord's commandments and ordinances.

7. And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were advanced in years.

8. Now when he came to officiate as priest in the order of his course,

9. it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to offer incense in the sanctuary.

10. And while the incense was burning, the whole congregation were praying without.

11. Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And Zacharias was discomposed at the sight, and in great terror.

13. But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for your prayer is heard, and Elizabeth your wife shall bear you a son, whom you shall name John.

14. He shall be to you matter of joy and transport; and many shall rejoice because of his birth.

15. For he shall be great before the Lord; he shall not drink wine nor any fermented liquor; but he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.

16. And many of the sons of Israel he shall bring back to the Lord their God.

17. Moreover, he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children, and by the wisdom of the righteous, to render the disobedient a people well disposed for the Lord.

18. And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this: for I am old man, and my wife is advanced in years?

19. The angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God, and am sent to tell you this joyful news.

20. But know that you shall be dumb, and shall not recover your speech, till the day when these things happen, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in due time.

21. Meanwhile the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he staid so long in the sanctuary.

22. But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; for he made them understand by signs, and remained speechless.

23. And when his days of officiating were expired, he returned home.

24. Soon after, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and lived in retirement five months, and said,

25. The Lord has done this for me, purposing now to deliver me from the reproach I lay under among men.

26. Now, in the sixth month, God sent Gabriel his angel, to Nazareth, a city of Galilee;

27. to a virgin betrothed to a man called Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.

28. When the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favorite of heaven! the Lord be with you, happiest of women!

29. At his appearance and words, she was perplexed, and revolved in her mind what this salutation could mean.

30. And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.

31. And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, whom you shall name Jesus.

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his Father.

33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever: his reign shall never end.

34. Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I have no intercourse with man?

35. The angel answering, said to her, The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore the holy progeny shall be called the Son of God.

36. And lo! your cousin Elizabeth also has conceived, a son in her old age; and she who is called barren, is now in her sixth month;

37. for nothing is impossible with God.

38. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to your word. Then the angel departed.

39. In those days Mary set out, and traveled expeditiously into the hill country; to a city of Judah;

40. where having entered the house of Zacharias, she saluted Elizabeth.

41. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's salutation, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,

42. and cried with a loud voice, You are the most blessed of women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

43. But how have I deserved this honor, to be visited by the mother of my Lord!

44. for know, that as soon as the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

45. And happy is she who believed that the things which the Lord has promised her, shall be performed.

46. Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,

47. and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;

48. because he has not disdained the low condition of his handmaid; for henceforth, all posterity will pronounce me happy.

49. For the Almighty, whose name is venerable, has done wonders for me.

50. His mercy on them who fear him, extends to generations of generations.

51. He displays the strength of his arm, and dispels the vain imaginations of the proud.

52. He pulls down potentates from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.

53. The needy he loads with benefits; but the rich he spoils of everything.

54. He supports Israel his servant, ever inclined to mercy,

55. (as he promised to our fathers) toward Abraham and his race.

56. And Mary, after staying with Elizabeth about three months, returned home.

57. When the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she brought forth a son;

58. and her neighbors and relations who heard that the Lord had shown her great kindness, rejoiced with her.

59. And, on the eighth day, when they came to the circumcision of the child, they would have called him by his father's name, Zacharias.

60. And his mother interposed, saying, No; but he shall be called John.

61. They said to her, There is none of your kindred of that name.

62. They, therefore, asked his father by signs, how he would have him called.

63. He, having demanded a table-book, wrote upon it, His name is John, which surprised them all.

64. And his mouth was opened directly, and his tongue loosed. And he spoke, praising God.

65. Now all in the neighborhood were struck with awe; and the fame of these things spread throughout all the hill country of Judea.

66. And all who heard these things, pondering them in their hearts, said, What will this child hereafter be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. Then Zacharias, his father, being filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, saying,

68. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people;

69. and has raised a Prince for our deliverance in the house of David his servant;

70. (as anciently he promised by his holy prophets)

71. for our deliverance from our enemies, and from the hands of all who hate us;

72. in kindness to our forefathers, and remembrance of his holy institution;

73. the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,

74. to grant to us, that being rescued out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him boldly,

75. in piety and uprightness all our days.

76. And you, child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go before the Lord, to prepare his way,

77. by giving the knowledge of salvation to his people, in the remission of their sins,

78. through the tender compassion of our God, who has caused a light to spring from on high to visit us,

79. to enlighten those who abide in darkness and in the shades of death; to direct our feet into the way of peace.

80. Meantime the child grew, and acquired strength of mind, and continued in the deserts, until the time when he made himself known to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. About that time, Cesar Augustus issued an edict, that all the inhabitants of the empire should be registered.

2. (This first register took effect, when Cyrenius was president of Syria.)

3. When all went to be registered, every one of his own city,

4. Joseph also went from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, to a city of David in Judea, called Bethlehem, (for he was of the house and lineage of David,)

5. to be registered, with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was pregnant.

6. While they were there, the time came, that she should be delivered.

7. And she brought forth her first born son, and swathed him, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the house allotted to strangers.

8. Now there were shepherds in the fields in that country, who tended their flocks by turns through the night watches.

9. On a sudden, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and a divine glory encompassed them with light, and they were frightened exceedingly.

10. But the angel said to them, Fear not; for lo! I bring you good tidings, which shall prove matter of great joy to all the people;

11. because today is born to you in the city of David, a Saviour, who is the Lord Messiah.

12. And by this you shall know him; you shall find a babe in swaddling bands, lying in a manger.

13. Instantly the angel was attended by a multitude of the heavenly host, who praised God, saying,

14. Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace, and good will amongst men!

15. And when the angels returned to heaven, having left the shepherds, these said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which has happened, of which the Lord has informed us.

16. And hastening thither, they found Mary and Joseph with the babe, who lay in the manger.

17. When they saw this, they published what had been imparted to them, concerning this child.

18. And all who heard it, wondered at the things told them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary let none of these things escape unobserved, weighing every circumstance within herself.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all that they had heard and seen, agreeably to what had been declared to them.

21. On the eighth day, when the child was circumcised, they called him Jesus, the angel having given him that name, before his mother conceived him.

22. And when the time of their purification was expired, they carried him to Jerusalem, as the law of Moses appoints, to present him to the Lord;

23. «(as it is written in the law of God,'Every male, who is the first born of his mother, is consecrated to the Lord:')»

24. and to offer the sacrifices enjoined in the law, a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.

25. Now there was at Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a just and religious man, who expected the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him,

26. and had revealed to him, that he should not dies, until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.

27. This man came, guided by the Spirit, into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what the law required,

28. he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,

29. Now, Lord, thou dost in peace dismiss thy servant, according to thy word;

30. for my eyes have seen the Saviour,

31. whom thou hast provided in the sight of all the world,

32. a luminary to enlighten the nations, and to be the glory of Israel thy people.

33. And Joseph, and the mother of Jesus heard, with admiration, the things spoken concerning him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, This child is destined for the fall and the rise of many in Israel, to serve as a mark for contradiction;

35. (yes, you own soul shall be pierced as with a javelin;) that the thoughts of many hearts may be disclosed.

36. There was also a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, in advanced age, who had lived seven years with a husband, whom she married when a virgin;

37. and being now a widow about eighty-four years, departed not from the temple, but served God in prayer and fasting night and day;

38. she also coming in at that instant, gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Jesus to all those in Jerusalem who expected redemption.

39. After they had performed everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and acquired strength of mind, being filled with wisdom, and adorned with a divine gracefulness.

41. Now, the parents of Jesus went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.

42. And when he was twelve years old, they having gone thither, according to the usage of the festival, and remained the customary time;

43. being on their return, the child Jesus staid behind in Jerusalem, and neither Joseph nor his mother knew it.

44. They supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and then sought him among their relations and acquaintances;

45. but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.

47. And all who heard him, were amazed at his understanding and answers,

48. and they beheld him with astonishment. And his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us thus? Behold, your father and I have sought you with sorrow.

49. He answered, Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in the courts of my Father?

50. But they did not comprehend his answer.

51. And he returned with them to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her memory.

52. And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and stature, and in power with God and man.

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, Pontius Pilate being procurator of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, Philip, his brother, tetrarch of Iturea, and the province of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene;

2. in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.

3. And he went through all the country along the Jordan, publishing the immersion of reformation for the remission of sins.

4. «As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah,» 'The voice of one proclaiming in the wilderness, Prepare a way for the Lord, make for him a straight passage.'

5. Let every valley be filled, every mountain and hill be leveled; let the crooked roads be made straight, and the rough ways smooth,

6. «that all flesh may see the salvation of God.»

7. Then said he to the multitudes, who flocked out to be immersed by him, Offspring of vipers, who has prompted you to flee from the impending vengeance?

8. Produce, then, the proper fruits of reformation; and say not within yourselves, We have Abraham for a father; for I assure you, that of these stones God can raise children to Abraham.

9. And even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Every tree, therefore, which produces not good fruit, is cut down, and thrown into the fire.

10. Upon this, the multitude asked him, What must we do then?

11. He answered, Let him who has two coats, impart to him who has none; and let him who has victuals do the same.

12. There came also publicans to be immersed, who said, Rabbi, what must we do?

13. He answered, Exact no more than what is appointed you.

14. Soldiers likewise asked him, And what must we do? He answered, Injure no man, either by violence, or false accusation, and be content with your allowance.

15. As the people were in suspense concerning John, every man imagining within himself that he might be the Messiah,

16. John addressed them all, saying, I, indeed, immerse in water; but one mightier than I comes, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to untie; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire;

17. his winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his grain; he will gather the wheat into his granary, and consume the chaff in unquenchable fire.

18. And with many other exhortations, he published the good tidings to the people.

19. But Herod, the tetrarch, having been reproved by him, on account of Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the crimes which Herod had committed,

20. added this to the number, that he confined John in prison.

21. Now when John immersed all the people, Jesus was likewise immersed; and while he prayed, the heaven was opened,

22. and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in a bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my Son, the beloved; in thee I delight.

23. Now Jesus was himself about thirty years in subjection, being (as was supposed) a son of Joseph, son of Heli,

24. son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Janna, son of Joseph,

25. son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai,

26. son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son of Shimei, son of Joseph, son of Judah,

27. son of Joanna, son of Reza, son of Zerubbabel, son of Salathiel, son of Neri,

28. son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmodam, son of Er,

29. son of Joses, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi,

30. son of Simeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonan, son of Eliakim,

31. son of Meleah, son of Mainan, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,

32. son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,

33. son of Aminadab, son of Ram, son of Hezron, son of Pharez, son of Judah,

34. son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,

35. son of Serug, son of Ragau, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Salah,

36. son of Cainan, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,

37. son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mehalaleel, son of Cainan,

38. son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.

## Luke 4

1. Now Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

2. where he continued forty days, and was tempted by the devil. Having eaten nothing all that time, when it was ended he was hungry:

3. and the devil said to him, If thou be God's Son, command this stone to become bread.

4. «Jesus answered him, saying, It is written,'Man does not live by bread only, but by whatever God pleases.'»

5. Then the devil, having brought him to the top of a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant,

6. and said to him, All this power and glory I will give thee; for it is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it;

7. if, therefore, thou wilt worship me, it shall all be thine.

8. «Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only.'»

9. Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and placing him on the battlement of the temple, said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down hence;

10. «for it is written,» 'He will give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee;'

11. «and, in their arms they shall uphold thee, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.»

12. «Jesus answered, It is said,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»

13. When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a time.

14. Then Jesus, by the impulse of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and his renown spread throughout the whole country,

15. and he taught in their synagogues with universal applause.

16. Being come to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he entered the synagogue, as his custom was, on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.

17. And they put into his hands the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book, he found the place where it is written,

18. «The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, inasmuch as he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to the poor, to announce liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release the oppressed,»

19. «to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.»

20. And having closed the book, and returned it to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.

21. And he began with saying to them, This very day, the scripture which you have just now heard, is fulfilled.

22. And all extolled him; but being astonished at the gracious words which he uttered, they said, Is not this Joseph's son?

23. «He said to them, You will doubtless apply to me this proverb,» 'Physician, cure yourself.' 'Do as great things here in your own country, as we hear you have done in Capernaum.'

24. But in fact, added he, No prophet was ever well received in his own country.

25. I tell you of a truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was shut up for three years and a half, so that there was great famine throughout all the land;

26. yet to none of them was Elijah sent, but to a widow in Sarepta, of Sidonia.

27. There were likewise many lepers in Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet; and Naaman the Syrian was cleansed, but none of those.

28. On hearing this, the whole synagogue were enraged,

29. and breaking up, drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.

30. But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.

31. Then he came to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath.

32. And they were struck with awe at his manner of teaching; for he spoke with authority.

33. Now there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, who roared out, saying,

34. Ah! Jesus of Nazareth, what hast thou to do with us? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art-the Holy One of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. On this, the demon, having thrown him into the middle of the assembly, came out without harming him.

36. And they were all in amazement, and said one to another, What does this mean, that with authority and power he command the unclean spirits, and they come out?

37. From that time, his fame was published in every corner of the country.

38. When he was gone out of the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon, whose wife's mother had a violent fever, and they entreated him on her behalf.

39. Jesus, standing near her, rebuked the fever, and it left her, and she instantly arose, and served them.

40. After sunset, all they who had any sick, of whatever kind of disease, brought them to him; and he, laying his hands on every one, cured them.

41. Demons also came out of many, crying out, Thou art the Son of God. But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah.

42. When it was day, he retired into a desert place; and the multitude sought him out, and came to him, and urged him not to leave them;

43. but he said to them, I must publish the good tidings of the Reign of God in other cities also, because for this purpose I am sent.

44. Accordingly, he made this publication in the synagogues of Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. Now it happened, as he stood by the lake Gennesaret, the multitude pressing upon him to hear the word of God;

2. that seeing two barks aground, near the shore, the fishermen having landed to wash their nets,

3. he went aboard one of them, which was Simon's; and desiring him to put off a little from the land, sat down, and taught the people out of the bark.

4. When he had done speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into deep water, and let down your nets for a draught.

5. Simon answered, Master, we have toiled all night, and have caught nothing; nevertheless, at your word, I will let down the net.

6. Having done this, they inclosed such a multitude of fishes, that the net began to break.

7. And they beckoned to their companions, in the other bark, to come and help them. And they came, and loaded both their barks, so that they were near sinking.

8. When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.

9. For the draught of fishes which they had taken had filled him and all his companions with terror,

10. particularly James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, henceforth you shall catch men.

11. And having brought their barks to land, they forsook all, and followed him.

12. When he was in one of the neighboring cities, a man covered with leprosy, happened to see him, threw himself on his face, and besought him, saying, Master, if you will, you can cleanse me.

13. Jesus stretching out his hand, and touching him, said, I will; be you cleansed. That instant his leprosy departed from him.

14. And he commanded him to tell no person. But go, said he, show yourself to the priest, and present the offered appointed by Moses, for notifying the people that you are cleansed.

15. Yet so much the more was Jesus everywhere talked of, that vast multitudes flocked to hear him, and to be cured by him of their maladies.

16. And he withdrew into solitary places, and prayed.

17. One day, as he was teaching, and Pharisees, and doctors of law, who had come from Jerusalem, and from every town of Galilee and Judea, were sitting by, the power of the Lord was exerted in the sure of the sick.

18. And, behold, some men carrying on a bed a man afflicted with a palsy, endeavored to bring him in, and place him before Jesus;

19. but finding it impracticable, by reason of the crowd, they got upon the roof, and let him down through the tiling, with the little bed, in the midst before him.

20. Jesus perceiving their faith, said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.

21. On which the Scribes and the Pharisees reasoned thus, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Can any one forgive sins except God?

22. Jesus knowing their thoughts, addressed himself to them, and said, What are you reasoning in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?

24. But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, Arise, said he to the palsied man, take up your bed, and return to your house.

25. That instant he rose in their presence, took up his bed, and returned home, glorifying God.

26. Seeing this, they were all struck with amazement and reverence, and glorified God, saying, We have seen wonderful things today.

27. After this, he went out, and observing a publican, named Levi, sitting at the toll-office, said to him, Follow me.

28. And he arose, left all, and followed him.

29. And Levi made him a great entertainment in his own house, where there was a great company of publicans and others, at table with them.

30. But the Scribes and the Pharisees of the place murmured, saying to his disciples, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

31. Jesus answering, said to them, It is not the healthy, but the sick, who need a physician.

32. I am come to call, not the righteous, but sinners, to reformation.

33. Then they asked him, How is it that the disciples of John, and likewise those of the Pharisees, frequently fast and pray, but yours eat and drink?

34. He answered, Would you have the bridesmen fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them: in those days they will fast.

36. He added this similitude, No man mends an old mantle with new cloth; otherwise the new will rend the old; besides, the old and new will never suit each other.

37. No person puts new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise, the new wine will burst the bottles, and thus the wine will be spoiled, and the bottles rendered useless.

38. But if new wine be put into new bottles, both will be preserved.

39. Besides, a man, after drinking old wine, calls not immediately for new; for he says, The old is milder.

## Luke 6

1. On the Sabbath called second prime, as Jesus was passing through the cornfields, his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and rubbed them in their hands and eat them.

2. And some Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?

3. Jesus replying, said to them, Did you never read what David and his attendants did, when they were hungry;

4. how he entered the mansion of God, and took and eat the loaves of the presence, and gave also of this bread to his attendants; though it can not be lawfully eat by any but the priests?

5. He added, The Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath.

6. It happened also on another Sabbath, that he went into the synagogue and taught; and a man was there whose right hand was blasted.

7. Now the Scribes and the Pharisees watched, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find matter for accusing him.

8. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to the man, whose hand was blasted, Arise, and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.

9. Then Jesus said to them, I would ask you, What is it lawful to do on the Sabbath? Good or ill? To save, or to destroy?

10. And, looking around on them all, he said to the man, stretch out your hand; and in doing this, his hand was rendered sound like the other.

11. But they were filled with madness, and consulted together, what they should do to Jesus.

12. In those days, Jesus retired to a mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in an oratory.

13. When it was day, he called to him his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom he named Apostles.

14. Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James, and John, Philip, and Bartholomew;

15. Matthew, and Thomas, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealous,

16. Judas, brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.

17. Afterward, Jesus, coming down with them, stopped on a plain, where a company of his disciples, with a vast multitude from all parts of Judea, Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon,

18. were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. Those also who were infested with unclean spirits, came, and were cured.

19. And every one strove to touch him, because a virtue came from him, which healed them all.

20. Then fixing his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy you poor, for the kingdom of God is yours!

21. Happy you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied! Happy you that weep now, for you shall laugh!

22. Happy shall you be when men shall hate you, and separate your from their society; yes, reproach and defame you, on account of the Son of Man!

23. Rejoice on that day, and triumph, knowing that your reward in heaven is great! for thus did their fathers treat the prophets.

24. But alas, for you rich; for you have received your comforts!

25. Alas, for you that are full; for you shall hunger! Alas, for you who laugh now; for you shall mourn and weep!

26. Alas, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers of the false prophets.

27. But I charge you, my hearers, love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,

28. bless them who curse you, pray for them who traduce you.

29. To him who smites you on one cheek, present the other; and from him who takes your mantle, withhold not your coat.

30. Give to every one who asks you; and from him who takes away your goods, do not demand them back.

31. And as you would that men should do to you, do you likewise to them.

32. For if you love those who love you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners love those who love them?

33. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners do the same?

34. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners lend to sinners, that they may received as much in return.

35. But love your enemies, do good and lend, nowise despairing; and your reward shall be great; and you shall be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and malignant.

36. Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful.

37. Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; release, and you shall be released;

38. give, and you shall get: good measure, pressed down and shaken, and heaped, shall be poured into your lap; for the very measure you give to others you yourself shall receive.

39. He also used this comparison: Can the blind guide the blind? Will not both fall into a ditch?

40. The disciple is not above his teacher; but every finished disciple shall be as his teacher.

41. And why do you observe the mote in your brother's eyes; but perceive not the splinter in your own eye?

42. Or how can you say to your brothers, Brother, let me take out the mote which is in your eye, not considering that there is a splinter out of your own eye; then you will see to take out the mote which is in your brother's eyes.

43. That is not a good tree which yields bad fruit; nor is that a bad tree which yields good fruit.

44. For every tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered off thorns; nor grapes off a bramble-bush.

45. The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings that which is good: the bad man out of the bad treasure of his heart, brings that which is bad; for it is out of the fulness of the heart that the mouth speaks.

46. But why do you, in addressing me, cry, Master, Master, and obey not my commands!

47. Whoever comes to me and hears my precepts, and practices them, I will show you whom he resembles:

48. he resembles a man who built a house, and digging deep, laid the foundation upon the rock: and when an inundation came, the torrent broke upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded upon rock.

49. But he who hears, and does not practice, resembles a man, who, without laying a foundation, built a house upon the earth: which, when the torrent broke against it, fell, and became a great pile of ruins.

## Luke 7

1. When he had finished his discourse in the audience of the people, he entered Capernaum.

2. And a centurion's servant, who was dear to his master, was sick, and in danger of dying.

3. And the centurion, having heard concerning Jesus, sent to him Jewish elders, to entreat him to come and save his servant.

4. When they came to Jesus, they earnestly besought him, saying, He is worthy of this favor;

5. for he loves our nations; and it was he who built our synagogue.

6. Then Jesus went with them; and when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, to say, Master, trouble not yourself; for I have not deserved that you should come under my roof;

7. wherefore neither thought I myself fit to come into your presence; say but the word, and my servant will be healed.

8. For even I, who am under the authority of others, having soldiers under me, say to one, Go, and he goes; to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

9. Jesus hearing these things, admired him, and turning, said to the multitude which followed, I assure you, I have not found so great faith even in Israel.

10. And they who had been sent, having returned to the house, found the servant well, who had been sick.

11. The day following, he went into a city called Nain, accompanied by his disciples, and a great crowd.

12. As he approached the gate of the city, the people were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, who was a widow; and many of the citizens were with her.

13. When the Lord saw her, he had pity upon her, and said to her, Weep not.

14. Then he advanced and touched the bier, (the bearers stopping,) and said, Young man, arise, I command you.

15. Then he who had been dead, sat up, and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother.

16. And all present were struck with awe, and glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us; and God has visited his people.

17. And this report, concerning him, spread throughout Judea, and all the neighboring country.

18. Now John's disciples had informed him of all these things,

19. and he called two of them, whom he sent to Jesus, to ask him, Are you He who comes, or must we expect another?

20. Being come to him, they said, John the Immerser has sent us to ask you, Are you He who comes, or must we expect another?

21. At that very time Jesus was delivering man from diseases and maladies, and evil spirits, and giving sight to many, who were blind.

22. And he returned this answer, Go, and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind are made to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear; the leprous are cleansed, the dead are raised, glad tidings are brought to the poor.

23. And happy is he to whom I shall not prove a stumbling block.

24. When John's messengers were departed, Jesus said to the multitude, concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?

25. But what did you go out to see? A man effeminately dressed? It is in royal palaces that they who wear splendid apparel, and live in luxury, are found.

26. What then did you go to see? a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and something superior to a prophet.

27. «For this is he, concerning whom it is written,'Behold, I send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way.'»

28. For I declare to you, among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Immerser; yet, the least in the Reign of God is greater than he.

29. All the people, even the publicans, who heard John, have, by receiving immersion from him, honored God;

30. whereas, the Pharisees and the lawyers, in not being immersed by him, have rejected the counsel of God with regard to themselves.

31. To what shall I compare the men of this generation? Whom are they like?

32. They are like children in the market place, of whom their companions complain, and say, We have played to you upon the pipe, but you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs to you, but you have not wept.

33. For John the Immerser is come, abstaining from bread and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners; and you say, He has a demon.

34. The Son of Man is come, using both; and you say, He is a lover of banquets, and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners.

35. But wisdom is justified by all her children.

36. Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him: and he went into the Pharisee's house, and placed himself at table.

37. And behold, a woman of the city who was a sinner, knowing that he eat at the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of balsam,

38. and standing behind at his feet weeping, bathed them with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the balsam.

39. The Pharisee, who had invited him, observing this, said within himself, If this man were a prophet, he would have known who this woman is that touches him, and of what character, for she is a sinner.

40. Then Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. He answered, Say it, Rabbi.

41. A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, the other fifty.

42. But not having the means to pay, he freely forgave them both. Say, then, which of them will love him most?

43. Simon answered, I suppose he whom he forgave most? Jesus replied, You have judged right.

44. Then turning to the woman, he said, Simon, Do you see this woman? When I came to your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.

45. You gave me no kiss; but she, since she entered, has not ceased kissing my feet.

46. You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with balsam.

47. Wherefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; therefore, her love is great. But he to whom little is forgiven, has little love.

48. Then he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.

49. Those, who were at table with him, said within themselves, Who is this, that even forgives sins?

50. But he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.

## Luke 8

1. Afterward he traveled through cities and villages, proclaiming the joyful tidings of the Reign of God, being attended by the twelve,

2. and by certain women, who had been delivered from evil spirits and distempers; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons;

3. Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna, and several others, who assisted him with their property.

4. Now, when a great multitude was assembled, and the people were flocking to him, out of the cities, he spoke by a parable.

5. The sower went out to sow his grain: and in sowing, part fell by the way-side, and was crushed under foot, or picked up by the birds;

6. part fell upon a rock, and when it was sprung up, withered away for want to moisture;

7. part of it also fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it;

8. and part fell into good soil, and sprung up, and yielded increase, a hundred fold. Having said this, he cried, Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.

9. And his disciples asked him, saying, What does this parable mean?

10. He answered, It is your privilege to know the secrets of the Reign of God, which, to others, are couched in parables; that, though they look, they may not perceive; that though they hear, they may not understand.

11. Now, this is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.

12. By the wayside are meant those hearers out of whose hearts the devil coming, takes away the word, these they should believe, and be saved.

13. By the rock are meant those, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet not having it rooted in them, are but temporary believers; for in the time of trial they fall off.

14. By the ground encumbered with thorns, are meant those hearers who are entangled in the business, and pursuits, and pleasures of life; which stifle the word, so that it brings no fruit to maturity.

15. But by the good soil are meant those, who, having heard the word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and persevere in bringing forth fruit.

16. A lamp is never lighted to be covered with a vessel, or put under a bed; but to be set on a stand, that they who enter may see the light.

17. For there is no secret which shall not be discovered; nor anything concealed which shall not be known, and become public.

18. Take heard, therefore, how you hear; for to him who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, shall be taken even that which he seems to have.

19. Then his mother and brothers came to speak with him; but could not get near him for the crowd.

20. And it was told him by some persons, Your mother and your brothers are without, desiring to see you.

21. But he, answering, said to them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey.

22. One day, Jesus having gone into a bark with his disciples, said to them, Let us cross the lake. Accordingly they set sail.

23. But while they sailed, he fell asleep; and there blew such a storm upon the lake, as filled the bark with water, and endangered lives.

24. And they came to him, and awakened him, saying, Master, Master, we perish! Then he arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And Jesus said to them, Where is your faith? But they said one to another, with fear and admiration, Who is this that commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?

26. And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.

27. Being come ashore, a man of the city met him, who had been long possessed by demons; and who wore no clothes, and had no habitation but the sepulchers.

28. When he saw Jesus, he roared out, and threw himself at his feet, crying, What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.

29. (For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for it had frequently seized him, so that when he was chained and fettered, he broke his bonds, and was driven by the fiend into the desert.)

30. «Then Jesus asked him, saying, What is your names? He answered, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.»

31. And they entreated him, that he would not command them to go into the deep;

32. but, as there was a numerous herd of swine feeding on the mountain, that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.

33. Then the demons having quitted the man, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a precipice into the lake, and were drowned.

34. The herdsmen, seeing this, fled, and spread the news through the city and villages.

35. And the inhabitants flocked out to see what had happened. Being come to Jesus, and finding the man of whom the demons were dispossessed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind, they were afraid.

36. But having been informed by the spectators, in what manner the demoniac delivered,

37. all the people of the country of the Gadarenes, entreated him to leave them; for they were struck with terror. Accordingly, he re-entered the bark, and returned.

38. Now, the man out of whom the demons were gone, entreated his permission to attend him. But Jesus dismissed him, saying,

39. Return home, and relate what great things God has done for you. Then he departed, and published through all the city, what great things Jesus had done for him.

40. Jesus, at his return, was welcomed by the crowd, who were all waiting for him.

41. Meantime, a man named Jairus, came, a ruler of the synagogue, who, throwing himself at the feet of Jesus, besought him to come into his house;

42. for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. As Jesus went along, the people crowded him;

43. and a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with an issue of blood, and had consumed all her living upon physicians, none of whom could cure her,

44. coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle; upon which her issue was stopped.

45. Then Jesus said, Who touched me? When every body denied it, Peter, and those with him, answered, Master, the multitude throng and press you, and do you say, Who touched me?

46. Jesus replied, Some person has touched me; for I am sensible that my power was just now exerted.

47. Then the woman perceiving that she was discovered, came trembling, and having thrown herself prostrate, declared to him, before all the people, why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed:

48. and he said to her, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you, go in peace.

49. While he was yet speaking, one came from the house of the director of the synagogue, who said, your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.

50. Jesus, hearing this, said to Jairus, Fear not; only believe, and she shall be well.

51. Being come to the house, he allowed no person to enter with him, except Peter, and John, and James, and the maid's father and mother.

52. And all wept, and lamented her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but asleep.

53. And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.

54. But he, having made them all retire, took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maiden, arise.

55. And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately, and he commanded to give her food.

56. And her parents were astonished, but he charged them not to mention to any person what had happened.

## Luke 9

1. Jesus, having convened the twelve, gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure diseases;

2. and sent them to proclaim the Reign of God, and to heal the sick.

3. And he said to them, Provide nothing for your journey; nor staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor two coats apiece;

4. and continue in whatever house you are received into, till you leave the place.

5. And wheresoever they will not receive you, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protestation against them.

6. They accordingly departed, and traveled through the villages, publishing the good tidings, and performing cures everywhere.

7. Now Herod, the tetrarch, having heard of all that Jesus had done, was perplexed; because some said, John is risen from the dead;

8. and some, Elijah has appeared; and others, One of the ancient prophets is risen again.

9. And Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he was desirous to see him.

10. Now, the Apostles having returned, reported to Jesus all that they had done: and he, taking them with him, retired privately to a desert belonging to the city of Bethsaida.

11. But the multitude, having known it, followed him; and he, receiving them, spoke to them concerning the Reign of God; and he healed those who had need of healing.

12. When the day began to decline, the twelve, accosting him, said, Dismiss the people, that they may go to the nearest towns and villages, and provide themselves lodging and food; for we are in a desert.

13. He answered, Supply them yourselves with food. They replied, We have only five loaves and two fishes; unless we go and buy victuals for all this people.

14. For they were about five thousand men. Then he said to his disciples, Make them recline in parties; fifty in a party.

15. And they did so, making them all recline.

16. Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to his disciples, to set before the multitudes.

17. And they all did eat and were satisfied; and took up twelve baskets full of fragments.

18. Afterward, Jesus having withdrawn from the multitude to pray, apart with his disciples, asked them, saying, Who do people say that I am?

19. They answered, John the Immerser; others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the ancient prophets is risen again.

20. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Messiah of God.

21. Then, having strictly charged them, he prohibited them from telling this to any person;

22. adding, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and rise again the third day.

23. Moreover, he said to all the people, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take his cross daily, and follow me.

24. For whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.

25. What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, with the forfeit or ruin of himself?

26. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in that of the Father, and of the holy angels.

27. I assure you, that there are some standing here, who shall not taste death till they see the Reign of God.

28. About eight days after this discourse, he took with him Peter, and John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.

29. While he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his raiment contracted a dazzling whiteness.

30. And, behold, two men of a glorious aspect, Moses and Elijah,

31. conversed with him, and spoke of the departure which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.

32. Now, Peter, and those that were with him, were overpowered with sleep; but when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with them.

33. As these were removing from Jesus, Peter said to him, not knowing what he said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us, then, make three booths, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

34. While he was speaking, a cloud came and covered them, and the disciples feared, when they entered the cloud.

35. From the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved; hear him.

36. While the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they kept secret, telling no person, in those days, anything of what they had seen.

37. The next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.

38. And one of the crowd cried out, saying, Rabbi, I beseech you, take pity on my son; for he is my only child.

39. And lo! a spirit seizes him, making him instantly cry out, and fall into convulsions, so that he foams; and after he is much bruised, hardly leaves him.

40. And I besought your disciples to expel the demon; but they were not able.

41. Then, Jesus answering, said, O incredulous and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring your son hither.

42. And as he was coming, the demon dashed him down in convulsions. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and having cured the child, delivered him to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the great power of God. While all were admiring everything which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,

44. Mark diligently these words, the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men.

45. But they understood not this language; it was veiled to them, that they might not apprehend it; and they were afraid to ask him concerning it.

46. And there arose a debate among them, which of them should be the greatest.

47. But Jesus, who perceived the thought of their heart, took a child, and placing him near himself,

48. said to them, Whosoever shall receive this child for my sake, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives him who sent me: for he who is the least amongst you all, this person shall be great.

49. Then John replied, Master, we saw one expelling demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he consorts not with us.

50. Jesus answered, Forbid not such; for whosoever is not against us, is for us.

51. Now, as the time of his departure approached, he set out resolutely for Jerusalem,

52. and sent messengers before, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make preparation for him.

53. But they would not admit him; because they perceived he was going to Jerusalem.

54. His disciples, James and John, observing this, said, Master, shall we call down fire from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did?

55. But he turned and rebuked them, saying, Do you not know of what spirit you are?

56. And they went to another village.

57. As they were on the way, one said to him, Master, I will follow you whithersoever you go.

58. Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter; but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.

59. He said to another, Follow me. He answered, Sir, permit me first to go and bury my father.

60. Jesus replied, Let the dead bury their dead; but go you and publish the Reign of God.

61. Another, likewise, said, I will follow you, Sir; but first permit me to take leave of my family.

62. Jesus answered, No man, having put his hand to the plow, looks behind him, is fit for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 10

1. Afterward, the Lord appointed seventy others, also, and sent them, two and two, before him, into every city and place whither he intended to go.

2. And he said to them, The harvest is plentiful, but the reapers are few: pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers to reap it.

3. Go, then; behold, I send you forth as lambs amongst wolves.

4. Carry no purse, nor bag, nor shoes; and salute no person by the way.

5. Whatever house you enter, say, first, Peace be to this house.

6. And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him; if not, it shall return upon itself.

7. But remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as it affords; for the workman is worthy of his wages; go not from house to house.

8. And whatever city you enter, if they receive you, eat such things as are set before you;

9. cure the sick, and say to them, The Reign of God comes upon you.

10. But whatever city you enter, if they do not receive you, go out into the streets, and say,

11. The very dirt of your streets, which cleaves to us, we wipe off against you; know, however, that the Reign of God draws nigh to you.

12. I assure you, that the condition of Sodom shall be more tolerable on that day, than the condition of that city.

13. Alas, for thee, Chorazin! Alas, for thee, Bethsaida! For if the miracles which have been performed in you, had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they had reformed long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. Wherefore, the condition of Tyre and Sidon shall be more tolerable, in the judgment, than yours.

15. And thou, Capernaum, which has been exalted in heaven, shall be thrown down to hades.

16. He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him who sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Master, even the demons are subject to us, through your name.

18. He said to them, I beheld Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

19. Lo! I empowered you to turn on serpents, and scorpions, and all the might of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.

20. Nevertheless, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven.

21. At that time, Jesus was joyful in spirit, and said, I adore thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth; because, having hid these things from sages, and the learned, thou hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, because such is thy pleasure.

22. My Father has imparted everything to me; and none knows who the Son is, but the Father; nor who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

23. Then, turning apart, he said to his disciples: Blessed are the eyes which see what you see.

24. For I assure you, that many prophets and kings have wished to see the things which you see; but have not seen them: and to hear the things which you hear; but have not heard them.

25. Then a lawyer stood up, and said, trying him, Rabbi, what must I do to obtain eternal life?

26. Jesus said to him, What does the law prescribe? What do you read there?

27. «He answered,» 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.'

28. Jesus replied, You have answered right. Do this, and you shall live.

29. But he, desirous to appear blameless, said to Jesus, Who is my neighbor?

30. Jesus said, in return, A man of Jerusalem, traveling to Jericho, fell among robbers; who, having stripped and wounded him, went away, leaving him half dead.

31. A priest, accidentally going that way, and seeing him, passed by on the father side.

32. Likewise a Levite, on the road, when he came near the place, and saw him, passed by on the farther side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion,

34. and went up to him; and having poured wine and oil into his wounds, he bound them up. Then he set him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

35. On the morrow, when he was going away, he took out two denarii, and giving them to the host, said, Take care of this man, and whatever you spend more, when I return I will repay you.

36. Now which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?

37. The lawyer answered, He who took pity upon him. Then said Jesus, Go you and do in like manner.

38. And, as he traveled, he went into a village, where a woman named Martha entertained him at her house.

39. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, listening to his discourse:

40. but Martha, who was much cumbered about serving, came to him and said, Master, do you not care that my sister leaves me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, assist me.

41. Jesus answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious, and trouble yourself about many things.

42. One thing only is necessary. And Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.

## Luke 11

1. It happened that Jesus was praying in a certain place; and when he had done, one of his disciples said to him, Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

2. He said to them, When you pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed; thy Reign come;

3. give us each day our daily bread;

4. and forgive us our sins, for even we forgive all who offend us; and lead us not into temptation.

5. Moreover, he said to them, Should one of you have a friend, and go to him at midnight, and say, Friend, lend me three loaves;

6. for a friend of mine is come off his road to see me, and I have nothing to set before him;

7. and he, from within, should answer, Do not disturb me; the door is now locked; I and my children are in bed; I can not rise to give you:

8. I tell you, though he will not rise and supply him, because he is his friend; he will, because of his importunity, get up, and give him as many as he wants.

9. I likewise tell you, ask, and you shall obtain; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you:

10. for whosoever asks, obtains; whosoever seeks, finds; and to every one who knocks, the door is opened.

11. What father amongst you, would give his son a stone when he asks bread; or, when he asks a fish, would, instead of a fish, give him a serpent;

12. or, when he asks an egg, would give him a scorpion?

13. If you, therefore, bad as you are, can give good things to your children; how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him!

14. Again, he was expelling a demon, which caused dumbness; and when the demon was gone out, the dumb spake, and the people wondered.

15. Some, however, said, He expels demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.

16. Others, to try him, asked of him a sign from heaven.

17. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, By intestine broils, any kingdom may be desolated, one family falling after another.

18. Now, if there be intestine broils in the kingdom of Satan; how can that kingdom subsist? for, you say, that I expel demons by Beelzebub.

19. Moreover, if I by Beelzebub expel demons; by whom do your sons expel them? Wherefore they shall be your judges.

20. But if I, by the finger of God, expel demons, the Reign of God has overtaken you.

21. When the strong one armed, guards his palace, his effects are secure.

22. But if he who is stronger, shall attack and overcome him, he will strip him of his armor, on which he relied, and dispose of his spoils.

23. He who is not for me, is against me; and he who gathers not with me, scatters.

24. The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, wanders over parched deserts, in search of a resting place. But not finding any, he says, I will return to my house, whence I came.

25. Being come, he finds it swept and embellished.

26. Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having entered, they dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.

27. While he was saying these things, a woman, raising her voice, cried to him, from amidst the crowd, Happy the womb which bore you! and the breast which suckled you!

28. Say, rather, replied he, Happy they who hear the word of God, and obey.

29. When the people crowded together, he said, This is an evil generation. They demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, only the sign of Jonah.

30. For, as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of Man be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south country will arise in the judgment against the men of this generation, and cause them to be condemned: because she came from the extremities of the earth, to hear the wise discourses of Solomon: and behold, here is something greater than Solomon.

32. The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment against this generation, and cause it to be condemned: because they reformed when warned by Jonah: and behold, here is something greater than Jonah.

33. A lamp is lighted, not to be concealed, or put under a vessel, but on a stand; that they who enter may have light.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye: when, therefore, your eye is sound, the whole body is enlightened; but when your eye is distempered, your body is in darkness.

35. Take heed, then, lest the light which is in you, be darkness.

36. If your whole body, therefore, be enlightened, having no part dark; the whole will be so enlightened, as when a lamp lights you by its flame.

37. While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went and placed himself at table.

38. But the Pharisee was surprised to observe that he used no washing before dinner.

39. Then the Lord said to him, As for you, Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of your cups and dishes, while you yourselves are inwardly full of rapacity and malevolence.

40. Unthinking men! did not he who made the outside, make the inside also?

41. Only give in alms what you have, and all things shall be clean to you.

42. Alas, for you, Pharisees! because you pay the tithe of mint and rue, and of every kind of herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These things you ought to have practiced, and not to have omitted those.

43. Alas, for you, Pharisees! because you love the most conspicuous seats in synagogues, and salutations in public places.

44. Alas, for you! because you are like concealed graves, over which people walk without knowing it.

45. Here, one of the lawyers interposing, said, By speaking thus, Rabbi, you reproach us also.

46. He answered, Alas, for you, lawyers! also; because you lade men with intolerable burdens-burdens which you yourselves will not so much as touch with one of your fingers.

47. Alas, for you! because you build the monuments of the prophets, whom your fathers killed.

48. Surely you are both vouchers and accessories to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their monuments.

49. Wherefore, thus says the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and Apostles: some of them they will kill, others they will banish;

50. so that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed since the formation of the world, shall be required of this generation;

51. from the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zechariah, who fell between the altar and the house of God. Yes, I assure you, all shall be required of this generation.

52. Alas, for you, lawyers! because you have carried off the key of knowledge; you have not entered yourselves, and those who entering, you hindered.

53. While he spoke these things, the Scribes and the Pharisees began vehemently to press him with questions, on many points;

54. laying snares for him, in order to draw from his own mouth, matter of accusation against him.

## Luke 12

1. Meantime, while the crowd, in myriads flocked about him, so that they trod one upon another, he said, addressing himself to his disciples, Above all things, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2. For there is nothing covered that shall not be detected: nothing secret that shall not be made known.

3. What you have spoken in the dark, shall be reported in the light; what you have whispered in the closet, shall be proclaimed from the housetop.

4. But I charge you, my friends, fear not them who kill the body, and after that can do no more;

5. but I will show you whom you ought to fear; fear him, who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell. I repeat it to you, Fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God:

7. yes, the very hairs of your head are all numbered: fear not, therefore; you are much more valuable than sparrows.

8. Moreover, I say to you, whoever shall acknowledge me before me, him the Son of Man will acknowledge before the angels of God;

9. but whoever denies me before men, shall be disowned before the angels of God.

10. And whosoever shall inveigh against the Son of Man, may obtain remission; but to him who detracts from the Holy Spirit, there is no remission.

11. And when you are brought before synagogues, and magistrates, and rulers; be not solicitous how or what you shall answer, or what you shall say:

12. for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that moment, what ought to be said.

13. Then one said to him out of the crowd, Rabbi, order my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

14. He answered, Man, who constituted me your judge or arbiter?

15. And he said to them, Be upon your guard against covetousness; for in whatever affluence a man be, his life depends not on his possessions.

16. He also used this example, A certain rich man had lands which brought forth plentifully.

17. And he reasoned thus with himself, What shall I do? for I have not where to store my crop.

18. I will do this, added he; I will pull down my storehouses, and build larger, and there I will store all my produce, and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast plenty of goods laid up for many years; take thin ease, eat, drink, enjoy thyself.

20. But God said to him, Fool! this very night your soul is required of you. Whose, then, shall those things be, which you have provided?

21. So it fares with him who amasses treasure for himself, but is not rich toward God.

22. Then he said to his disciples, For this reason I charge you, be not anxious about your life, what you shall eat; nor about your body, what you shall wear.

23. Life is a greater gift than food, and the body than clothing.

24. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap; have neither cellar nor barn; but God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than fowls?

25. Besides, which of you can, by his anxiety, prolong his life one hour?

26. If, therefore, you can not thus effect even the smallest thing, why are you anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies. How do they grow? They toil not; they spin not; yet I affirm, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not equally adorned with one of these.

28. If, then, God so array the herbage, which today is in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he array you, O you distrustful!

29. Do not ask, therefore, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; live not in anxious suspense.

30. For all these things the Pagans seeks; whereas, your Father knows that you need them.

31. But seek you the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be superadded to you.

32. Fear not, my little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell your goods and give alms; provide yourselves purses which wear not out; treasure inexhaustible in heaven, where no thieves approach, where nothing is spoiled by worms.

34. For where your treasure is, your heart will likewise be.

35. Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning;

36. and yourselves, like those who wait their master's return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately let him in.

37. Happy those servants whom their master, at his return, shall find watching. Indeed, I say to you, that he will gird himself, and having placed them at table, will attend and serve them.

38. And whether he comes in the second watch, or in the third, if he finds things thus, happy are those servants.

39. You are certain that if the master of the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would watch, and not allow him to break into his house.

40. Be you, then, always prepared; because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you are not expecting him.

41. Then Peter said to him, Master, is this parable directed to us alone, or to all?

42. The Lord said, Who, now, is the discreet and faithful steward, whom the master will set over his household, to dispense regularly the allowance of corn!

43. Happy that servant, if his master, at his arrival, shall find him so employed.

44. I tell you truly, he will entrust him with the management of all his estate.

45. But as to the servant who shall say within himself, My master delays his return, and shall beat the men-servants and the maids, and shall feast, and carouse, and be drunken;

46. the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour of which he is not apprised, and having discarded him, will assign him his portion with the faithless.

47. And that servant who knew his master's will, yet did not make himself ready, nor execute his orders, shall receive many stripes;

48. whereas, he who knew not, but did things deserving chastisement, shall receive few: for much will be required of every one to whom much is given; and the more a man is entrusted, the more will be exacted from him.

49. I came to throw fire upon the earth; and what would I but that it were kindled?

50. I have an immersion to undergo; and how am I pained till it be accomplished?

51. Do you imagine that I am come to give peace to the earth? I tell you, No; but division.

52. For hereafter, five in one family will be divided; three against two, and two against three:

53. father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.

54. He said also to the people, When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say, It will rain immediately, and so it happens;

55. and when the south wind blows, you say, It will be hot, and it happens accordingly.

56. Hypocrites, you can judge of what appears in the sky, and on the earth; how is it that you can not judge of the present time?

57. and why do you not, even of yourselves, discern what is just?

58. When you go with your creditor to the magistrate, endeavor, on the road, to satisfy him, lest he drag you before the judge, and the judge consign you to the sergeant, and the sergeant commit you to prison:

59. I assure you, you will not be released until you have paid the last mite.

## Luke 13

1. There were present then some, who informed Jesus of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with that of their sacrifices.

2. Jesus answering, said to them, Do you think that these Galileans were the greatest sinners in all Galilee, because they suffered such usage?

3. I tell you, No: but unless you reform, you shall all likewise perish;

4. or, those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and slew them; do you think that they were the greatest profligates in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, No: but unless you reform, you shall all likewise perish.

6. He also spoke this parable: A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and came seeking fruit on it, but found none.

7. Then he said to the vine-dresser, This is the third year that I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, without finding any. Cut it down: why should it cumber the ground?

8. He answered, Sir, let it alone one year longer till I dig about it, and manure it;

9. perhaps it will bear fruit: if not, you may afterward cut it down.

10. On the Sabbath, as he was teaching in a synagogue,

11. a woman was present, who, for eighteen years, had a spirit of infirmity, by which she was so bowed down that she could not so much as look up.

12. Jesus, perceiving her, called her to him, and, laying his hand on her, said, Woman, you are delivered from your infirmity.

13. Immediately she stood upright, and glorified God.

14. But the director of the synagogue, moved with indignation, because Jesus had performed a cure on the Sabbath, said to the people, There are six days for working; come, therefore, on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.

15. To which the Lord replied, Hypocrites! who is there amongst you that does not, on the Sabbath, loose his ox or ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?

16. And must not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound, lo! these eighteen years, be released from this bond on the Sabbath day?

17. On his saying this, all his opposers were ashamed; but the whole multitude was delighted with all the glorious actions performed by him.

18. He said, moreover, What does the kingdom of God resemble? To what shall I compare it?

19. It resembles a grain of mustard seed, which a man threw into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air took shelter in its branches.

20. Again, he said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It resembles leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

22. And he took a journey to Jerusalem; teaching as he passed through cities and villages:

23. and one asked him, Master, are there but few who shall be saved? He answered,

24. Force your entrance through the straight gate; for many, I assure you, will request to be admitted, who shall not prevail.

25. If once the master of the house shall have arisen and locked the door, and you standing without and knocking, say, Master, Master, open to us; he will answer, I know not whence you are.

26. Then they will say, We have eat and drunk with you, and you have taught in our streets.

27. But he will answer, I tell you, I know not whence you are: remove hence, all you workers of unrighteousness.

28. Then will ensue weeping, and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets received into the kingdom of God, and yourselves excluded:

29. nay, people will come from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south, and will place themselves at table in the kingdom of God.

30. And, behold, they are last, who shall be first; and they are first, who shall be last.

31. The same day, certain Pharisees came to him, and said, Get away; depart hence, for Herod intends to kill you.

32. He answered, Go, tell that fox, Today and to-morrow I expel demons, and perform cures, and the third day my course will be completed.

33. Nevertheless, I must walk about today and to-morrow, and the day following; for it can not be, that a prophet should be cut off anywhere but in Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that killest the prophets, and stonest them whom God sends to you! how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings; but you would not!

35. Quickly shall your house be deserted; for indeed, I say to you, you shall not see me, till the time when you shall say, Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord!

## Luke 14

1. It happened on a Sabbath, when he was gone to eat at the house of one of the rulers, who was a Pharisee, that while the Pharisees were observing him,

2. a man who had a dropsy stood before him.

3. Then Jesus addressing himself to the lawyers and Pharisees, said, Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?

4. They being silent, he took hold of the man, healed and dismissed him.

5. Then resuming his discourse, he said to them, Who, amongst you, if his ass or his ox fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?

6. And to this they were not able to make him a reply.

7. Observing how eager the guests were to possess the higher places at the table, he gave them this injunction,

8. When you are invited to a wedding, do not occupy the highest place at table, lest one more considerable than you be bidden,

9. and he who invited you both, come and say to you, Give place to this man; and you should then rise with confusion, to take the lowest place.

10. But when you are invited, go to the lowest place, that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher; for that will do you honor before the company.

11. For whoever exalts himself, shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself, shall be exalted.

12. He said also to him who had invited him, When you give a dinner, or a supper, do not invited your rich friends, brothers, cousins, or neighbors, lest they also invite you, in their turn, and you be recompensed.

13. But when you give an entertainment, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;

14. and you shall be happy; for, as they have not the means to requite you, you shall be requited at the resurrection of the righteous.

15. One of the guests, hearing this, said to him, Happy be he who shall feast in the Reign of God.

16. Jesus said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.

17. And at supper time he sent his servants, to tell those who had been invited to come presently; for, that all was ready.

18. But they all, without exception, made excuses. One said, I have purchased a field, which I must go and see; I pray you have me excused.

19. Another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, which I am going to prove; I pray you have me excused.

20. A third said, I have married a wife; and, therefore, I can not go.

21. The servant being returned, related all to his master. Then the master of the house was angry, and said to his servants, Go immediately into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.

22. Afterward, the servant said, Sir, your orders are executed, and still there is room.

23. The master answered, Go out into the highways, and along the hedges, and compel people to come, that my house may be filled:

24. for I declare to you, that none of those who were invited, shall taste of my supper.

25. As great multitudes traveled along with him, he turned to them, and said,

26. If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters; nay, and himself, too; he can not be my disciple.

27. And whosoever does not follow me, carrying his cross, can not be my disciple.

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first, by himself, compute the expense, to know whether he have the means to complete it;

29. lest, having laid the foundation, and being unable to finish, he become the derision of all who see it;

30. who will say, This man began to build, but was not able to finish.

31. Or what king, going to engage another king, with whom he is at war, does not first consult, by himself, whether he can, with ten thousand men, encounter him who comes against him with twenty thousand;

32. that if he can not, he may, while the other is at a distance, send an embassy to sue for peace.

33. So then, whosoever he be of you, who does not renounce all that he has, he can not be my disciple.

34. Salt is good; but if the salt become insipid, with what shall it be seasoned?

35. It is fit neither for the land, nor for the dunghill, but is thrown away. Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. Now, all the publicans and the sinners resorted to Jesus, to hear him.

2. But the Pharisees and the Scribes murmured, saying, This man admits sinners, and eats with them.

3. Then he addressed this similitude to them:

4. What man, amongst you, who has a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, to go after that which is lost, till he find it?

5. And having found it, does he not joyfully lay it on his shoulders,

6. and when he is come home, convene his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost?

7. Thus, I assure you, there is greater joy in heaven for one sinner who reforms, than for ninety-nine righteous persons, who need no reformation.

8. Or what woman, who has ten drachmas, if she lose one, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?

9. And having found it, does she not assemble her female friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost!

10. Such joy, I assure you, have the angels of God, when any sinner reforms.

11. He said, also, A certain man had two sons.

12. and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my portion of the estate. And he allotted to them their shares.

13. Soon after, the younger son gathered all together, and traveled into a distant country, and there wasted his substance in riot.

14. When all was spent, a great famine came upon that land, and he began to be in want.

15. Then he applied to one of the inhabitants of the country, who sent him into his fields to keep swine.

16. And he desired to appease his hunger with the husks on which the swine were feeding; for no person gave him anything.

17. At length, coming to himself, he said, How many hirelings has my father, who have all more bread than suffices them, while I perish with hunger!

18. I will arise, and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you,

19. and am no longer worthy to be called your son.

20. And he arose, and went to his father. When he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and threw himself upon his neck, and kissed him.

21. And the son said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.

22. But the father said to his servants, Bring here the principal robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger, and shoes on his feet:

23. bring also the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and be merry;

24. for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. So they began to be merry.

25. Now his elder son was in the field, walking home. And as he drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.

26. He, therefore, called one of the servants, and asked the reason of this.

27. He answered, Your brother is returned, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him in health.

28. And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore, his father came out, and entreated him.

29. He answering, said to his father, These many years I have served you, without disobeying your command in anything; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might entertain my friends;

30. but no sooner did this, your son, return, who had squandered your living on prostitutes, than you killed for him the fatted calf.

31. Son, replied the father, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours:

32. it was but reasonable that we should rejoice and be merry; because this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.

## Luke 16

1. He said, likewise, to his disciples, A certain rich man had a steward, who was accused to him of wasting his estate.

2. Having, therefore, called him, he said, What is this that I hear of you? Render an account of your management, for you shall be steward no longer.

3. And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? My master takes from me the stewardship; I can not dig, and am ashamed to beg.

4. I am resolved what to do, that when I am discarded, there may be some who will receive me into their houses.

5. Having, therefore, sent severally for all his master's debtors, he asked one, How much do you owe my master?

6. He answered, A hundred baths of oil. Take back your bill, said the steward, sit down directly, and write fifty.

7. Then he asked another, How much do you owe? He answered, A hundred homers of wheat. Take back your bill, said he, and write eighty.

8. The master commended the prudence of the unjust steward; for the children of this world are more prudent in conducting their affairs, than the children of light.

9. Therefore, I say to you, with the deceitful riches procure to yourself friends, who, after your discharge, may receive you into the eternal mansion.

10. Whoso is faithful in little is faithful also in much: and whoso is unjust in little, is unjust also in much.

11. If, therefore, you have not been honest in the deceitful, who will entrust you with the true riches?

12. And if you have been unfaithful managers for another, who will give you anything to manage for yourselves?

13. A servant can not serve two masters: for either he will hate one, and love the other; or, at least, will attend one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and mammon.

14. When the Pharisees, who loved money, heard all these things, they ridiculed him.

15. But he said to them, As for you, you make yourselves pass upon men for righteous, but God knows your hearts; for that which is admired of men is abhorred of God.

16. You had the law and the prophets till the coming of John, since whose time, the kingdom of God is announced, and every occupant enters it by force.

17. But sooner shall heaven and earth perish, than one tittle of the law shall fail.

18. Whoever divorces his wife, and takes another, commits adultery; and whoever marries the divorced woman, commits adultery.

19. There was a certain rich man, that wore purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day.

20. There was also a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, that was laid at his gate,

21. and who was desirous to feed on the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.

22. It happened that the poor man died, and was conveyed by angels to Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.

23. And in hades, being in torments, he looked up, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom,

24. and cried, saying, Have pity on me, father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tortured in this flame.

25. Abraham answered, Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is in joy, and you are in torments.

26. Besides, there lies a huge gulf between us and you, so that they who would pass hence to you, can not: neither can they pass to us, who would come thence.

27. The other replied, I entreat you, then, father, to send him to my father's house;

28. for I have five brothers, that he may admonish them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham answered, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.

30. Nay, said he, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they would reform.

31. Abraham replied, if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should arise from the dead.

## Luke 17

1. Then Jesus said to his disciples, It is impossible to exclude snares entirely; but, alas, for him who ensnares!

2. It would be more eligible for him to have an upper millstone fastened to his neck, and to be cast into the sea, than to ensnare one of these little ones.

3. Take heed yourselves: if your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he reforms, forgive him;

4. and if he trespass against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day return, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.

5. Then the Apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.

6. He answered, If you had faith, though it were but as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine, Be extirpated, and planted in the sea, and it would obey you.

7. Would any of you, who has a servant plowing or feeding cattle, say to him on his return from the field, Come, immediately, and place yourself at table;

8. and not rather, Make ready my supper; gird yourself and serve me, until I have eat and drunk; afterward you may eat and drink?

9. Is he obliged to that servant for obeying his orders? I suppose not.

10. In like manner say you, when you have done all that is commanded of you, We, your servants, have conferred no favor; we have done only what we were bound to do.

11. Now, in traveling to Jerusalem, he pass through the confines of Samaria and Galilee;

12. and being about to enter a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood at a distance,

13. and cried out, Jesus, Master, take pity upon us.

14. When he saw them, he said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, perceiving that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God aloud.

16. Then throwing himself prostrate at the feet of Jesus, he returned him thanks. Now this man was a Samaritan.

17. Jesus said, Were not ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?

18. Have none returned glory to God except this alien?

19. And he said to him, Arise, go your way; your faith has cured you.

20. Being questioned by the Pharisees, when the Reign of God should commence, he answered, The Reign of God is not ushered in with parade;

21. nor shall people say, Lo, here! or Lo, yonder! for behold, the Reign of God is within you.

22. Then he said to his disciples, The time will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and shall not see it.

23. But when they say to you, Lo, here! or Lo, yonder! go not out to follow them.

24. For as the lightning flashes in an instant from one extremity of the sky to the other, so will the appearance of the Son of Man be, in his day.

25. But first he must suffer much, and be rejected of this generation.

26. And, as it happened in Noah's days, it will also happen in the days of the Son of Man.

27. They eat, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, when the deluge came, and destroyed them all.

28. In like manner as it was in the days of Lot, they eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

29. but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, which destroyed them all;

30. so it will be on the day when the Son of Man shall appear.

31. On that day, let not him who shall be on the house-top, having his furniture in the house, come down to take it away. Let not him who shall be in the field, return home.

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it.

34. I tell you, there will be two men, that night, in one bed; one will be seized, and the other will be left.

35. Two women will be grinding together; one will be seized, and the other will be left.

36. OMITTED TEXT

37. Then they asked him, Where, Master? He answered, Where the body is, the eagles will be assembled.

## Luke 18

1. He also showed them, by a parable, that they ought to persist in prayer, without growing weary.

2. In a certain city, said he, there was a judge, who neither feared God nor regarded man.

3. And there was a widow in that city, who came to him, saying, Do me justice on my adversary.

4. For some time he refused; be afterward he argued thus with himself, Although I neither fear God, nor regard man;

5. yet, because this widow importunes me, I will judge her cause; let she come perpetually, and plague me.

6. Mark, said the Lord, what the unjust judge determined.

7. And will not God avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he linger in their cause?

8. I assure you, he will suddenly avenge them. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find this belief upon the earth?

9. Then addressing some who were conceited of themselves, as being righteous, and despised others, he proposed this example:-

10. Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, the other a publican.

11. The Pharisee standing by himself, prayed thus: -O God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.

12. I fast twice a-week. I give tithes of all that I possess.

13. But the publican, standing at a distance, and not daring so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, smote his breast, and cried, God, be merciful to me a sinner.

14. I assure you, that this man returned home more approved than the other: for whoever exalts himself, shall be humbled; but whoever humbles himself, shall be exalted.

15. Then they presented babes to him, that he might touch them: the disciples observing it, rebuked them.

16. But Jesus calling them to him, said, Permit the children to come to me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Indeed, I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall never enter it.

18. Then a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what good shall I do to obtain eternal life?

19. Jesus answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good.

20. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery; do not commit murder; do not steal; do not give false testimony; honor your father and your mother.

21. He replied, All these I have observed from my childhood.

22. Hearing this, Jesus said to him, Yet in one thing you are deficient: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: then come and follow me.

23. When he heard this, he was exceedingly sorrowful; for he was very rich.

24. Jesus, perceiving that he was very sorrowful, said, How difficult will it be for men of opulence to enter the kingdom of God.

25. It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.

26. «The hearers said, Who, then, can be saved?»

27. Jesus answered, Things impossible to men, are possible to God.

28. Then Peter said, Lo! we have forsaken all, and followed thee.

29. Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that there is none who shall have forsaken his house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, on account of the kingdom of God;

30. who shall not receive manifold more in return, in this world, and in the future, eternal life.

31. Then Jesus, taking the twelve aside, said to them, We are now going to Jerusalem, where that all the prophets have written, shall be accomplished on the Son of Man.

32. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and ridicules, and insulted, and spitted on.

33. And after scourging, they will kill him; and he shall rise again the third day.

34. But they understood none of these things: this discourse was dark to them; they did not comprehend its meaning.

35. When he came near to Jericho, a blind man who sat by the way-side begging,

36. hearing the crowd pass by, inquired what was the matter.

37. And being told that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by,

38. he immediately cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.

39. They who went before, charged him to be silent; but he cried the louder, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.

40. Jesus stopped, and commanded them to bring the man to him. And when he was nigh, he asked him, saying,

41. What do you wish me to do for you? He answered, Master, to give me my sight.

42. And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has cured you.

43. Instantly he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people saw it, and praised God.

## Luke 19

1. When Jesus had entered, and was passing through Jericho,

2. behold, a man named Zaccheus, a rich man, and chief of the publicans,

3. endeavored to see what sort of person he was, but could not for the press, being of a low stature.

4. Therefore, running before, he climbed up into a sycamore, to see him; having observed that he was going that way.

5. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and seeing him, said, Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at your house.

6. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

7. When the multitude perceived this, they said, murmuring, He is gone to be entertained by a sinner.

8. But Zaccheus, presenting himself before Jesus, said, Master, half of my goods I will give to the poor; and if in anything I have wronged any man, I will restore fourfold.

9. And Jesus said, concerning him, Today is salvation come to this house; inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of Man is come to seek and recover that which was lost.

11. As the people were attentive, he added this parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and they fancied the Reign of God would immediately commence.

12. A certain nobleman went abroad to procure for himself the royalty, and then return;

13. and having called ten of his servants, and delivered to them ten pounds, he said, improve these till I return.

14. Now his citizens hated him; and sending an embassy after him, protested, We will not have this man for our king.

15. When he returned, vested with royal power, he commanded those servants to be called to whom he had committed the money, that he might know what every one had gained.

16. Then the first came, and said, My Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.

17. He answered, Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very small matter, receive the government of ten cities.

18. And the second who came, said, My Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.

19. He answered, Be you also governor of five cities.

20. Another came, saying, My Lord, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin;

21. for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard master; you exact what you did not give, and reap what you did not sow.

22. He answered, Out of your own mouth, you malignant servant, I will condemn you. Did you know that I am a hard master, exacting what I did not give, and reaping what I did not sow?

23. Why, then, did you not put my money into the bank; that at my return I might have received it with interest?

24. Then he said to his attendants, Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has ten pounds.

25. They answered, My Lord, he has ten pounds.

26. He replied, I tell you, that to every one who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken.

27. But as for those my enemies, who would not have me for their king, bring them hither, and slay them in my presence.

28. After this discourse, Jesus walked foremost, traveling toward Jerusalem.

29. When he approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

30. saying, Go to yonder village, where, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever rode; loose him, and bring him.

31. If any one ask you why you loose him, you shall answer, Because the Master needs him.

32. Accordingly, they who received this order, went, and found everything as he had told them.

33. As they were loosing the colt, the owners said to them, Why loose you the colt?

34. They answered, The Master needs him.

35. So they brought him to Jesus, and having thrown their mantles upon the colt, set Jesus on it.

36. As he went, the people spread their mantles in the way before him.

37. When he was so near as the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God in loud acclamations, for all the miracles which they had seen;

38. saying, Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!

39. Upon this, some Pharisees in the crowd said to him, Rabbi, rebuke your disciples.

40. He answered, I tell you, that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.

41. When he came near, and beheld the city, he wept over it,

42. saying, O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes:

43. for the days are coming upon thee, when thine enemies will surround thee with a rampart, and inclose thee, and shut thee up on every side;

44. and will level thee with the ground, thee and thy children, and will not leave one stone upon another, because thou didst not know the time when thou wast visited.

45. Afterward he went into the temple, and drove out thence those who sold, and those who bought in it,

46. «saying to them, It is written,'My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»

47. And he taught daily in the temple, while the chief priests and the scribes, and persons of principal note, sought his destruction;

48. but could not devise how to effect it: for all the people heard him with the greatest attention.

## Luke 20

1. One of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and publishing the good tidings, the chief priests, and the scribes, with the elders, came upon him,

2. saying, Tell us by what authority you do these things; or who is he that empowered you?

3. He answering, said to them, I also have a question to put to you. Tell me, then,

4. Was the commission which John had to immerse, from heaven, or from men?

5. But they reasoned thus among themselves, If we say, From heaven, he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?

6. And if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

7. They therefore answered, that they could not tell whence.

8. Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

9. Then he spoke to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and farmed it out, and having traveled, continued long abroad.

10. The season being come, he sent a servant to the husbandmen, to receive of the produce of the vineyard; but they beat him, and sent him back empty.

11. Afterward, he sent another servant, whom they, having beaten, and used shamefully, also sent away empty.

12. He afterward dispatched a third to them. Him, likewise, they wounded and drove away.

13. Then the proprietor of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; they will surely reverence him, when they see him.

14. But when then husbandmen saw him, they reasoned thus among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.

15. And having thrust him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What, therefore, will the proprietor of the vineyard do to them?

16. He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And some of his hearers said, God forbid.

17. «Jesus, looking on them, said, What, then, means that expression of scripture,» 'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner.'

18. «Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces?»

19. At that time, the chief priests and the scribes, knowing that he had spoken this parable against them, would have laid hands on him, but feared the people.

20. And they watched him, and set spies upon him, instructing them to personate conscientious men, and surprise him in his words, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the procurator.

21. These accosted him with this question, Rabbi, we know that you speak and teach uprightly, and that, without respect of persons, you faithfully recommend the way of God.

22. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Cesar, or not?

23. He perceiving their subtlety, answered,

24. Why would you entangle me? Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it? They answered, Cesar's.

25. He replied, Render, therefore, to Cesar, that which is Cesar's, and to God, that which is God's.

26. Thus they could not surprise him in his discourses before the people; wherefore, admiring his answer, they kept silence.

27. Afterward, some of the Sadducees, who deny a future state, came to him

28. with this question: Rabbi, Moses has enjoined in his writings, that a man whose brother dies childless, outlived by his wife, shall marry the widow, and raise issue to his brother.

29. Now there were seven brothers; the first of whom, having taken a wife, died childless;

30. the second married the widow, and also died childless;

31. the third married her, as did likewise the rest; and all seven died, leaving no children.

32. Last of all, the woman also died.

33. To which of them, therefore, will she be wife, at the resurrection; for she had been married to all the seven?

34. Jesus answering, said to them, The people of this world marry, and are given in marriage;

35. but, among them who shall be honored to share in the resurrection, and the other world, there will be neither marrying nor giving in marriage;

36. for they can not die any more; because, like the angels, they are children of God, being children of the resurrection.

37. But that the dead are raised, even Moses has suggested, calling the Lord who appeared in the bush, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. Now he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for they are all alive to him.

39. Then some of the scribes said to him, Rabbi, you have spoken well.

40. After that, they did not venture to ask him any more questions.

41. And he said to them, Why is it affirmed that the Messiah must be a son of David?

42. «Yet David himself says, in the book of the Psalms,» 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,'

43. «till I make thy foes thy footstool.»

44. As David thus calls him his Lord, how can he be David's son?

45. Then, in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples,

46. Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in robes, and affect salutations in public places, and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts;

47. who devour the families of widows, and make long prayers for a disguise. These shall suffer the severest punishment.

## Luke 21

1. As Jesus was observing the rich casting their gifts into the treasury,

2. he saw an indigent widow throw in two mites.

3. And he said, I tell you, truly, that this poor widow has cast in more than any of them;

4. for all of these, out of their superfluous store, have thrown into the sacred chest, she has thrown in all the little that she had.

5. Some having remarked, that the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and presents, he said,

6. The time will come, when these things which you behold, shall be razed that one stone will not be left upon another.

7. Then they asked him, saying, Rabbi, when will these things be: and what will be the sign, when they are about to be accomplished?

8. He answered, Take care that you be not seduced: for many will assume my character, saying, I am the person, and the time approaches; therefore, do not follow them.

9. But when you shall hear of wars and insurrections, be not terrified: for these things must first happen; but the end will not immediately follow.

10. He added, Then will nation rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. And there shall be great earthquakes in sundry places, and famines, and pestilences; there shall be also frightful appearances, and great prodigies in the sky.

12. But, before all this, you shall be apprehended and prosecuted, and delivered to synagogues, and imprisoned, and dragged before kings and governors, because of my name:

13. and this afford scope for your testimony.

14. Be, therefore, resolved not to premeditate what defense you shall make;

15. for I will give you an utterance, and wisdom, which none of your adversaries shall be able to refute or resist.

16. And you shall be given up even by parents, and brothers, and kinsmen, and friends; and some of you will be put to death.

17. And, on my account, you shall be universally hated.

18. Yet not a hair of your head shall be lost.

19. Save your souls by your perseverance.

20. Now, when you shall see Jerusalem invested with armies, know that its desolation is nigh.

21. Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains; let those in the city make their escape, and let not those in the country enter the city:

22. for these will be days of vengeance, in which all the denunciations of the scriptures shall be accomplished.

23. But, alas, for the women with child, and for them who give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

24. They shall fall by the sword; they shall be carried captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be over.

25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth, the anguish of desponding nations; and roarings in the seas, and floods;

26. men expiring with the fear and apprehension of those things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

27. Then they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great glory and power.

28. Now when these things begin to be fulfilled, look up, and lift up your heads; because your deliverance approaches.

29. He proposed to them, also, this comparison: Consider the fig tree, and the other trees.

30. When you observe them shooting forth, you know, of yourselves, that the summer is nigh.

31. Know, in like manner, when you shall see these events, that the Reign of God is nigh.

32. Indeed, I say to you, that this race shall not fail until all be accomplished.

33. Heaven and earth shall fail; but my words shall not fail.

34. Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and worldly cares, and that day come upon you unawares: for, as a net,

35. it shall inclose all the inhabitants of the earth.

36. Be vigilant, therefore, praying on every occasion, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these approaching evils, and to stand before the Son of Man.

37. Thus Jesus taught in the temple by day, but retired at night to the mountain, called the Mount of Olives.

38. And every morning the people resorted early to the temple to hear him.

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread, called the passover, being near,

2. the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.

3. Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.

4. And he went and concerted with the chief priests and officers, how he might deliver Jesus into their hands.

5. And they were glad, and agreed to give him a certain sum,

6. which Judas having accepted, watched an opportunity to deliver him up without tumult.

7. Now, this day of unleavened bread being come, on which the passover must be sacrificed,

8. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat it.

9. They asked him, Where shall we prepare it?

10. He answered, When you enter the city, you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he shall enter,

11. and say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he will show you a large upper room, furnished; make ready there.

13. So they went, and having found everything as he had told them, prepared the passover.

14. When the hour was come, he placed himself at table with the twelve Apostles,

15. and said to them, Much have I longed to eat this passover with you,

16. that I will never partake of another, until it be accomplished in the kingdom of God.

17. Then, taking a cup, he gave thanks, and said, Take this, and share it amongst you;

18. for I assure you, that I will not again drink of the product of the vine, until the Reign of God be come.

19. Then he took bread, and having given thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in commemoration of me.

20. He likewise gave the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new Institution in my blood, which is shed for you.

21. Mark, however, that the hand of him who betrays me, is on the table with mine.

22. The Son of Man is going away, as has been determined: nevertheless, alas, for that man by whom he is betrayed!

23. Then they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it could be that would do this.

24. There had been, also, a contention amongst them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.

25. And he said to them, The king of the nations exercise dominion over them; and they who oppress them, are styled benefactors.

26. But with you, it must be otherwise: nay, let the greatest amongst you be as the least; and him who governs, as he who serves.

27. For, which is greater, he who is at table, or he who serves? Is not he that is at table? Yet I am amongst you as one who serves.

28. You are they who have continued with me in my trials.

29. And I grant to you, (forasmuch as my Father has granted me a kingdom,)

30. to eat, and to drink at my table, in my kingdom, and to sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. The Lord said, also, Simon, Simon, Satan has obtained permission to sift you as wheat;

32. but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not; do you, therefore, when you have recovered yourself, confirm your brethren.

33. He answered, Master, I am ready to accompany you, both to prison, and to death.

34. Jesus replied, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow today, before you have thrice denied that you know me.

35. Then he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and bag, and shoes, did you want anything?

36. But now, said he, let him that has a purse, take it, and likewise his bag; and let him who has no sword, sell his mantle, and buy one;

37. «for I tell you that this scripture,» 'He was ranked among malefactors,' 'is now to be accomplished in me: for the things relating to me must be fulfilled.'

38. They said, Master, here are two swords. He replied, It is enough.

39. Then he went out, and repaired, as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.

40. Being arrived there, he said to them, Pray that you may not yield to temptation.

41. Then, being withdrawn from them about a stone's cast; he kneeled down and prayed,

42. saying, Father, if thou wilt, take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.

43. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.

44. And being in an agony of grief, he prayed the more fervently, and his sweat fell like clotted blood to the ground.

45. Having risen from prayer, and returned to the disciples, he found them sleeping, oppressed with grief;

46. and said to them, Why do you sleep? Arise, and pray, lest the trial overcome you.

47. Before he had done speaking, he saw a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, walked before them, and came up to Jesus, to kiss him.

48. Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?

49. Now, those who were with him, foreseeing what would happen, said to him, Master, shall we strike with the sword?

50. And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51. Jesus said, Let this suffice; and touching his ear, he healed him.

52. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and the officers of the temple-guard, and the elders, who were come to apprehend him, Do you come with swords and clubs, as in pursuit of a robber?

53. While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not attempt to arrest me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

54. Then they seized him, and led him away to the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance.

55. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and were sitting round it, Peter sat down among them.

56. And a maid servant, having observed him sitting by the fire, and viewed him attentively, said, This man also was with him.

57. But he disowned him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

58. A little while after, another seeing him, said, You, also, are one of them. Peter answered, Man, I am not.

59. About an hour after, another averred the same thing, saying, This man was surely with him, for he is a Galilean.

60. Peter answered, Man, I know nothing of this matter. And just as he spoke the word, a cock crew.

61. Then the Lord, turning, looked upon Peter, and Peter called to mind the word which the Lord had said to him, Before the cock crow, you will disown me thrice.

62. And he went out and wept bitterly.

63. Meantime, they who had Jesus in charge, mocked and beat him;

64. and having blindfolded him, struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Divine who it is that smote you.

65. And many other abusive things they said against him.

66. As soon as it was day, the national senate, with the chief priests and scribes, were assembled, and having caused him to be brought into their council-chamber, said to him,

67. If you be the Messiah, tell us. He answered, If I tell you, you will not believe:

68. and if put a question, you will neither answer me, nor acquit me.

69. Hereafter the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of Almighty God.

70. They all replied, You are, then, the Son of God? He answered, You say the truth.

71. Then they cried, What further need have we of evidence? We have heard enough ourselves, from his own mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And the assembly broke up, and conducted Jesus to Pilate:

2. and they accused him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, calling himself Messiah the King.

3. Then Pilate, asking him, said, You are the King of the Jews? He answered, You say right.

4. Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitude, I find nothing criminal in this man.

5. But they became more vehement, adding, He raised sedition among the people, by the doctrine which he spread through all Judea, from Galilee, where he began, to this place.

6. When Pilate heard them mention Galilee, he asked, whether the man were a Galilean.

7. And finding that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also then at Jerusalem.

8. And Herod was very glad to see Jesus: it was what he had long desired; having heard much of him, and hoping to see him perform some miracle.

9. He, therefore, asked him many questions, but Jesus returned him no answer.

10. Yet the chief priests and the scribes, who were present, accused him with eagerness.

11. But Herod and his military train despised him: and having, in derision, arrayed him in a splendid robe, remanded him to Pilate.

12. On that day, Pilate and Herod became friends; for, before, they had been at enmity.

13. Pilate, having convened the chief priests, the magistrates and the people,

14. said to them, You have brought this man before me, as one who excites the people to revolt; yet, having examined him in your presence, I have not found him guilt of any of those crimes of which you accuse him.

15. Neither has Herod; for I referred you to him. Be assured, then, that he has done nothing to deserve death.

16. I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

17. For it was necessary that he should release one to them at the festival.

18. Then all cried out together, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.

19. Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for raising sedition in the city, and for murder.

20. Pilate, willing to release Jesus, again, expostulated.

21. But they cried, saying, Crucify! crucify him!

22. A third time he repeated, Why? What evil has this man done? I do not find him guilty of any capital crime; I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

23. But they persisted, demanding, with much clamor, that he might be crucified. At last, their clamors, and those of the chief priests, prevailed:

24. and Pilate pronounced sentence, that it should be as they desired.

25. Accordingly, he released a man who had been imprisoned for sedition and murder; whom they required; and gave up Jesus to their will.

26. As they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him, that he might bear it after Jesus.

27. And a great multitude followed him, amongst whom were many women, who lamented and bewailed him.

28. But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children:

29. for the days are coming, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, the wombs which never bare, and the breasts which never gave suck!

30. Then they shall cry to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:

31. for if it fare thus with the green tree, how shall it fare with the dry?

32. And two malefactors were also led with him to execution.

33. When they came to the place called Calvary, they there nailed him to a cross, and the malefactors also; one at his right hand, the other at his left.

34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they parted his garments by lot.

35. While the people stood gazing, even their rulers joined them in ridiculing him, and saying, This man saved others; let him save himself, if he be the Messiah, the elect of God.

36. The soldiers likewise mocked him, coming and offering him vinegar,

37. and saying, If you be the King of the Jews, save yourself.

38. There was also an inscription over his head in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. Now, one of the malefactors who suffered with him, reviled him, saying, If you be the Messiah, save yourself and us.

40. The other, rebuking him, answered, Have you no fear of God, you who are undergoing the same punishment?

41. And we, indeed, justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.

42. And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest to thy kingdom.

43. Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, Today you shall be with me in paradise.

44. And, about the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land, which lasted till the ninth.

45. The sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.

46. And Jesus said with a loud voice, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; and having thus said, he expired.

47. Then, the centurion, observing what had happened, gave glory to God; saying, Assuredly, this was a righteous man.

48. Nay, all the people who were present at this spectacle, and saw what had passed, returned, beating their breasts.

49. And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, standing at a distance, beheld these things.

50. Now, there was a senator, named Joseph, a good and just man,

51. from Arimathea, a city of Judea, who had not concurred in the resolutions and proceedings of the rest; and who himself, also expected the Reign of God.

52. This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

53. And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb cut in stone, in which no man had ever been deposited.

54. Now that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath approached.

55. And the women, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, followed Joseph, and observed the tomb, and how the body was laid.

56. When they returned, they provided spices and ointments, and then rested the Sabbath, according to the commandment.

## Luke 24

1. But the first day of the week, they went by daybreak, with some others, to the tomb, carrying the spices which they had provided,

2. and found the stone rolled away from the tomb;

3. and having entered, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. While they were in perplexity on this account, behold, two men stood by them, in robes of a dazzling brightness.

5. The women being affrighted, and fixing their eyes on the ground, these said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke to you, before he left Galilee,

7. saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

8. Then they remembered his words.

9. On their return from the tomb, they reported the whole matter to the eleven, and to all the other disciples.

10. It was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told these things to the Apostles:

11. but their account appeared to them as idle tales; they gave them no credit.

12. Peter, however, arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, saw nothing there but the linen lying. And he went away, musing with astonishment on what had happened.

13. The same day, as two of the disciples were traveling to a village named Emmaus, sixty furlongs from Jerusalem,

14. they conversed together about all these events.

15. While they were conversing and reasoning, Jesus himself joined them, and went along with them.

16. But their eyes were so affected that they did not know him.

17. And he said to them, What subjects are these about which you confer together? and why are you dejected?

18. And one of them, named Cleopas, answered, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do you not know the things which have happened there so lately?

19. What things? said he. They answered, Concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet, powerful in word and deed, before God and all the people;

20. how our chief priests and magistrates have delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

21. As for us, we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. Besides all this, today, being the third day since these things happened,

22. some women of our company have astonished us; for having gone early to the tomb,

23. and not found his body, they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he is alive.

24. And some of our men went to the tomb, and found matters exactly as the women had related; but him they saw not.

25. Then he said to them, O thoughtless men, and backward to believe things which have been all predicted by the prophets!

26. Ought not the Messiah thus to suffer, and so to enter into his glory?

27. Then beginning with Moses, and proceeding through all the prophets, he explained to them all the passages relating to himself.

28. When they came near the village, whither they were traveling, he seemed as intending to go farther;

29. but they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it grows late, and the day is far spent. And he went to abide with them.

30. While they were at table together, he took the loaf, and blessed and broke it, and distributed to them.

31. Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he disappeared.

32. And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us on the road, and expounded to us the scriptures?

33. Immediately they arose and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven, and the rest of their company assembled,

34. who said, The Master is actually risen, and has appeared to Simon.

35. These also recounted what had happened on the road, and how he was made known to them in breaking the loaf.

36. While they discoursed in this manner, he stood in the midst of them, and said, Peace be to you.

37. But they were amazed and affrighted, imagining that they saw a spirit.

38. And he said to them, Why are you so alarmed? And wherefore do suspicious arise in your hearts?

39. Behold my hands and my feet; it is I myself; handle me and be convinced; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have.

40. Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.

41. While yet they believed not, for joy and amazement, he said to them, Have you here anything to eat?

42. And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb,

43. which he took and eat in their presence.

44. And he said to them, This is what I told you while I remained with you, that all the things which are written of me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must be accomplished.

45. Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures;

46. and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Messiah to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day;

47. and that reformation and the remission of sins should be proclaimed, in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. Now, you are witnesses of these things;

49. and behold I send you that which my Father has promised; but do you continue in this city, until you be invested with power from above.

50. He then led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

51. And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

52. And having worshiped him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy;

53. and were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God.
