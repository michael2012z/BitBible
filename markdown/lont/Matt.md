# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The History of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.

2. Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot Jacob. Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.

3. Judah had Pharez and Zarah by Tamar. Pharez begot Ezrom. Ezrom begot Aram.

4. Aram begot Aminidab. Aminidab begot Nashon. Nashon begot Salmon.

5. Salmon had Boaz by Rahab. Boaz had Obed by Ruth. Obed begot Jesse.

6. Jesse begot David the king. David the king had Solomon, by her who had been the wife of Uriah.

7. Solomon begot Rehoboam. Rehoboam begot Abia. Abia begot Asa.

8. Asa begot Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begot Joram. Joram begot Uzziah.

9. Uzziah begot Jotham. Jotham begot Ahaz. Ahaz begot Hezekiah.

10. Hezekiah begot Manasseh. Manasseh begot Amon. Amon begot Josiah.

11. Josiah had Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time of the migration into Babylon.

12. After the migration into Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel. Salathiel begot Zerubbabel.

13. Zerubbabel begot Abiud. Abiud begot Eliakim. Eliakim begot Azor.

14. Azor begot Zadoc. Zadoc begot Achim. Achim begot Eliud.

15. Eliud begot Eleazar. Eleazar begot Matthan. Matthan begot Jacob.

16. Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon, fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen.

18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened thus: Mary his mother had been espoused to Joseph; but before they came together, she proved to be with child by the Holy Spirit.

19. Joseph her husband being a virtuous man, and unwilling to expose her, intended to divorce her privately.

20. But while he was thinking upon this, an angel of the Lord appearing to him in a dream, said, Joseph, son of David, scruple not to take home Mary your wife; for her pregnancy is from the Holy Spirit.

21. And she shall bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.

22. In all this what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet was verified,

23. «Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, who shall be called Immanuel;» 'which signifies, God with us.'

24. When Joseph awoke, he did as the messenger of the Lord had commanded him, and took home his wife;

25. but knew her not, until she had brought forth her first born son, whom he named Jesus.

## Matthew 2

1. After the birth of Jesus, at Bethlehem of Judea, in the reign of King Herod, certain eastern magicians came to Jerusalem, and inquired,

2. Where is the new-born King of the Jews; for we have seen his star in the east country, and are coming to do him homage?

3. King Herod hearing this, was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. And having assembled all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he demanded of them where the Messiah should be born.

5. They answered, at Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the Prophet,

6. «And thou Bethlehem, in the canton of Judah, are not the least illustrious among the cities of Judah; for out of thee shall come a ruler, who will govern my people Israel.»

7. Then Herod having secretly called the magicians, procured from them exact information concerning the time of the star's appearing.

8. And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, make an exact inquiry about the child; and when you have found him bring me word, that I may go also, and pay him homage.

9. Having heard the King, they departed; and lo! the star which had appeared to them in the east country, moved before them, till it came, and stood over the place, where the child was.

10. When they again saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly.

11. And being come into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother; and, prostrating themselves, did him homage. Then opening their caskets, they offered, as presents to him, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

12. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went home another way.

13. When they were gone, lo! a messenger of the Lord appearing to Joseph in a dream, said, Arise, take the child with his mother, and flee into Egypt; and remain there till I order you; for Herod will seek the child to destroy him.

14. Accordingly he arose, took the child with his mother, and withdrew by night into Egypt,

15. «where he continued until the death of Herod; so that, what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet, was verified,» 'Out of Egypt I called my Son.'

16. Then Herod, finding that he had been deceived by the magicians, was highly incensed and dispatched emissaries who slew, by his order, all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all its territory, from those entering the second year, down to the time of which he had procured exact information from the magicians.

17. Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,

18. «A cry was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and bitter complaint: Rachel bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.»

19. When Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appearing in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, said,

20. Arise, take the child with his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought his life.

21. Accordingly, he arose, took the child with his mother, and came to the land of Israel;

22. but hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod in the throne of Judea, he was afraid to return thither; and being warned in a dream, retired into the district of Galilee,

23. and resided in a city named Nazareth; in this verifying the declarations of the Prophet concerning Jesus, that he should be called a Nazarene.

## Matthew 3

1. In those days appeared John the Immerser, who proclaimed in the wilderness of Judea, saying,

2. Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.

3. «For this is he, of whom the Prophet Isaiah speaks in these words,» 'The voice of one proclaiming in the wilderness, Prepare a way for the Lord, make for him a straight passage.'

4. Now John wore raiment of camel's hair with a letter girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country along the Jordan, resorted to him,

6. and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But he seeing many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to receive immersion, said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has prompted you to flee from the impending vengeance?

8. Produce, then, the proper fruit of reformation;

9. and presume not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I assure you, that of these stones God can raise children to Abraham.

10. And even now the ax lies at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, which produces not good fruit, is cut down, and turned into fuel.

11. I, indeed, immerse you in water, into reformation; but he who comes after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit, and in fire.

12. His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his grain; he will gather his wheat into the granary, and consume the chaff in unquenchable fire.

13. Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, to be immersed by John.

14. But John excused himself, saying, It is I who need to be immersed by you; and you come to me!

15. Jesus answering, said to him, Permit this at present; for thus ought we to ratify every institution. Then John acquiesced.

16. Jesus being immersed, no sooner arose out of the water, than heaven was opened to him; and the Spirit of God appeared, descending like a dove, and lighting upon him;

17. while a voice from heaven proclaimed, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.

## Matthew 4

1. Then was Jesus conducted by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.

2. And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

3. Then the tempter accosting him, said, If thou be God's Son, command that these stones become loaves.

4. «Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Man lives not by bread only, but by everything which God is pleased to appoint.'»

5. Then the devil conveyed him into the holy city, and having placed him on the battlement of the temple,

6. «said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down; for it is written,» 'He will give his angels the charge of thee: they shall uphold thee in their arms, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.'

7. «Jesus again answered, It is written,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»

8. Again the devil took him up a very high mountain, whence he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their glory,

9. and said to him, All these will I give thee, if thou wilt prostrate thyself, and worship me.

10. «Jesus answered, Satan, begone; for it is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord they God, and shall serve him only.'»

11. Then the devil leaving him, angels came and ministered to him.

12. Now Jesus, hearing that John was imprisoned, retired into Galilee,

13. and having left Nazareth, resided at Capernaum, a seaport in the confines of Zebulun and Naphtali,

14. thereby verifying the words of Isaiah the Prophet;

15. «The canton of Zebulun and the canton of Naphtali, situate on the Jordan near the sea, Galilee of the nations;»

16. the people who abode in darkness, saw a great light, and on those who inhabited a region of the shades of death, light has arisen.

17. From that time Jesus began to proclaim, saying, Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.

18. Then walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon named Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers.

19. And he said to them, Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. Immediately they left the nets and followed him.

21. Passing on he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the bark with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.

22. They immediately, leaving the bark and their father, followed him.

23. Then Jesus went over all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every sort of disease and malady among the people.

24. And his fame spread through all Syria, and they brought him all their sick, seized and tormented with various distempers, demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.

25. And vast multitudes followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the banks of the Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. Jesus, seeing so great a confluence, repaired to a mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him.

2. Then breaking silence, he taught them, saying:

3. Happy the poor who repine not; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!

4. Happy they who mourn; for they shall receive consolation!

5. Happy the meek; for they shall inherit the land!

6. Happy they who hunger and thirst for righteousness; for they shall be satisfied!

7. Happy the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy!

8. Happy the pure in heart; for they shall see God!

9. Happy the peace-makers; for they shall be called sons of God!

10. Happy they who suffer persecution on account of righteousness; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!

11. Happy shall you be, when men shall revile and persecute you; and, on my account, accuse you falsely of every evil thing!

12. Rejoice and exult, for great is your reward in heaven; for thus the Prophets were persecuted, who were before you.

13. You are the salt of the earth. If the salt become insipid, how shall its saltness be restored? It is thenceforth fit only to be cast out, and trod under foot.

14. You are the light of the world. A city situate on a mountain must be conspicuous.

15. A lamp is lighted to be put, not under a vessel, but on a stand, that it may shine to all the family.

16. Thus, let your light shine before men, that they, seeing your good actions, may glorify your Father, who is in heaven.

17. Think not that I am come to subvert the law or the prophets. I am come not to subvert, but to ratify.

18. For, indeed, I say to you, heaven and earth shall sooner perish, than one iota, or on tittle of the law shall perish, without attaining its end.

19. Whosoever, therefore, shall violate, or teach others to violate, were it the least of these commandments, shall be in no esteem in the Reign of Heaven; but whosoever shall practice and teach them, shall be highly esteemed in the Reign of Heaven.

20. For I tell you, that unless your righteousness excel the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.

21. «You have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not commit murder; for whosoever commits murder shall be obnoxious to the judges.'»

22. But I say to you, whosoever is angry with his brother unjustly, shall be obnoxious to the judges; whosoever shall call him fool, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall call him miscreant, shall be obnoxious to hell fire.

23. Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there recollect, that your brother has ground to complain of you;

24. leave there your gift before the altar: first go and procure reconciliation with your brother; then come, and offer your gift.

25. Compound speedily with your creditor, while you are on the road together; lest he deliver you to the judge; and the judge consign you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.

26. Indeed, I say to you, you will not be released, until you have discharged the last farthing.

27. «You have heard that it was said,'You shall not commit adultery.'»

28. But I say to you, whoever looks on another man's wife, in order to cherish impure desire, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. Therefore, if your right eye ensnare you, pluck it out, and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.

30. And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.

31. «It has been said,'Whosoever would dismiss his wife, let him give her a writ of divorce.'»

32. But I say to you, whosoever shall dismiss his wife, except for whoredom, is the occasion of her becoming an adulteress; and whosoever marries her that is dismissed, commits adultery.

33. «Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.'»

34. But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;

35. nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither shall you swear by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;

36. not by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.

37. But let your yes, be Yes; your no, No; for whatever exceeds these, proceeds from evil.

38. «You have heard that it was said,'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'»

39. But I say to you, contend not with the injurious. But if any one strike you on the right cheek, turn to him also the left.

40. Whoever will sue you for your coat, let him have your mantle likewise.

41. And if a man constrain you to go one mile with him, go two.

42. Give to him that asks you; and him that would borrow from you, put not away.

43. «You have heard that it was said,'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'»

44. But I say to you, love your enemies; bless them who curse you; do good to them who hate you; and pray for them who arraign and persecute you;

45. that you may be children of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun arise on bad and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.

46. For if you love them only who love you, what reward can you expect? Do not even the publicans so?

47. And if you salute your brothers only, wherein do you excel? Do not even the Pagans as much?

48. Be you therefore perfect, as your father who is in heaven is perfect.

## Matthew 6

1. Take heed that you perform not your religious duties before men, in order to be observed by them; otherwise you will obtain no reward from your Father who is in heaven.

2. When, therefore, you give alms, do not proclaim it by sound of trumpet, as the hypocrites do, in the assemblies and in the streets, that they may be extolled by men. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.

3. But you, when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;

4. that your alms may be in secret; and your Father, to whom nothing is secret, will himself recompense you.

5. And when you pray, be not like the hypocrites, who affect to pray standing in the assemblies, and at the corners of the streets, that men may observe them. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.

6. But you, when you would pray, retire to your closet; and having shut the door, pray to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.

7. And in prayer, use not a multiplicity of words as the Pagans do, who think that using many words will gain them acceptance.

8. Imitate them not; for your Father knows what things you want, before you ask him.

9. Thus, therefore, pray you: Our Father, who art in heaven, thy name be hallowed;

10. thy Reign come; thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven;

11. give us today our daily bread;

12. forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;

13. and lead us not into temptation, but preserve us from evil.

14. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;

15. but if you forgive not others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16. Moreover, when you fast, look not dismal, as the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces, that men may observe that they fast. Indeed, I say to you, they have their reward.

17. But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;

18. that your fasting may not appear to men, but to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.

19. Amass not for yourselves treasure upon the earth, where moths and rust may consume it, or thieves breaking in may steal it.

20. But provide for yourselves treasure in heaven, where are neither moths nor rust to consume it, nor thieves to break in and steal it.

21. For where your treasure is, your heart will also be.

22. The eye is the lamp of the body. If, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be enlightened;

23. but if your eye be distempered, your whole body will be dark. And if even the light which is in you be darkness, how great will the darkness be!

24. A man can not serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or at least he will attend to one, and neglect the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.

25. Therefore I charge you, be not anxious about your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall wear. Is not life a greater gift than food; and the body more than raiment?

26. Observe the fowls of heaven. They neither sow nor reap. They have no storehouse; but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you much more valuable than they?

27. Besides, which of you can, by his anxiety, prolong his life one hour?

28. And why are you anxious about raiment? Mark the lilies of the field. How do they grow? They toil not: they spin not.

29. Yet I affirm that even Solomon in all his glory, was not equally adorned with one of these.

30. If, then, God so array the herbage, which today is in the field, and to-morrow will be cast into the oven, will he not much more array you, O you distrustful!

31. Therefore say not anxiously, (as the heathens do,) What shall we eat; or what shall we drink; or with what shall we be clothed?

32. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

33. But seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness required by him; and all these things shall be superadded to you.

34. Be not then anxious about the morrow: the morrow will be anxious about itself. Sufficient for every day is its own trouble.

## Matthew 7

1. Judge not, that you be not judged;

2. for as you judge, you shall be judged; and the measure which you give, the same you shall receive.

3. And why do you observe the mote in your brother's eye, but you are insensible of the splinter in your own eye?

4. Or how dare you say to your brother, let me take the mote out of your eye; when lo! you have a splinter in your own?

5. Hypocrite, first take the splinter out of your own eye; then you will see clearly to take the mote out of your brother's eye.

6. Give not things holy to dogs, and cast not your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot, and turn upon you, and tear you apart.

7. Ask, and you shall obtain; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

8. For whosoever asks, obtains; whosoever seeks, finds; and to every one who knocks, the door shall be opened.

9. Who of you men would give his son a stone, when he asks bread;

10. or a serpent, when he asks a fish?

11. If you then, though evil, can give good things to your children, how much more will your Father, who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?

12. Whatever you would that others do to you, do you the same to them; for this is the law and the prophets.

13. Enter in through the strait gate; for wide is the gate of perdition, broad is its way leading thither; and many are they who enter by it.

14. But how strait is the gate of life; how narrow the way leading thither; and how few are they who find it!

15. Beware of false teachers, who come to you in the garb of sheep, while inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

16. By their fruits you shall discover them. Are grapes gathered from thorns; or figs from thistles?

17. Every good tree yields good fruit, and every evil tree evil fruit.

18. A good tree can not yield evil fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit.

19. Every tree which yields not good fruit, is cut down, and turned into fuel.

20. Wherefore, by their fruits you shall discover them.

21. Not every one who says to me, Master, Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father, who is in heaven.

22. Many will say to me on that day, Master, Master, have we not taught in thy name, and in thy name performed many miracles?

23. To whom I will declare, I never acknowledged you. Depart from me, you who practice iniquity.

24. Therefore, whosoever hears these my precepts, and does them, I will compare to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock.

25. For although the rain descended, and the rivers overflowed, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not, because it was founded upon the rock.

26. But whosoever hears these my precepts, and does them not, shall be compared to a simpleton, who built his house upon the sand.

27. For when the rain descended, and the rivers overflowed, and the winds blew, and dashed against that house, it fell, and great was its ruin.

28. When Jesus had ended this discourse, the people were struck with awe at his manner of teaching;

29. for he taught as one who had authority, and not as the Scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. Being come down from the mountain, followed by a great multitude,

2. a leper came, who, presenting himself before him, said, Sir, if you will, you can cleanse me.

3. Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.

4. Then Jesus said to him, See you tell no person; but go, show yourself to the priest, and make the oblation prescribed by Moses, for notifying the cure to the people.

5. Having entered Capernaum, a centurion accosted him with this request,

6. Sir, my man-servant lies sick at home, exceedingly afflicted with a palsy.

7. Jesus answered, I will go and cure him.

8. The centurion replying, said, Sir, I am not worthy, that you should come under my roof; only say the word, and my servant will be healed.

9. For even I, who am under command myself, having soldiers under me, say to one, Go, and he goes; to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

10. Jesus hearing this, was astonished, and said to those who followed, Indeed, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.

11. But I assure you, that many will come from the east and from the west, and will be placed at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven,

12. while the sons of the kingdom shall be thrust out into outer darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

13. Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go home; be it to you, according to your faith. That instant his servant was cured.

14. Then Jesus having entered Peter's house, saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever,

15. and having touched her hand, the fever left her; on which she arose and entertained him.

16. In the evening they presented to him many demoniacs; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and cured all the sick;

17. «thus verifying the saying of the Prophet Isaiah,» 'He has himself carried off our infirmities, and borne our distresses.'

18. Jesus seeing himself crowded on all sides, gave orders to pass to the opposite shore.

19. Meantime, a scribe accosted him, saying, Rabbi, I will follow you whithersoever you go.

20. Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter, but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.

21. Another, one of his disciples, said to him, Master, permit me to go first, and bury my father.

22. Jesus answered, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.

23. Then entering the bark, his disciples followed him.

24. Soon after there arose in the sea so great a tempest, that the bark was covered with billows. But he being asleep,

25. the disciples came and waked him, saying, Save us, Master, we perish.

26. He answered, Why are you so timorous, O you distrustful? Then he arose, and having commanded the winds and the sea, a great calm ensued;

27. insomuch that every one exclaimed with admiration, What personage is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey.

28. When he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs, issuing out of the monuments, so furious, that no person durst pass that way.

29. These instantly cried, saying, What hast thou to do with us, Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

30. Now there was feeding, at some distance, a great herd of swine.

31. And the friends besought him, saying, If thou expel us, permit us to go into the herd of swine.

32. He answered, Go. And when they were cast out, they went into the swine; on which the whole herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.

33. Then the herdsmen fled into the city, and reported everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.

34. Presently the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and having seen him, entreated him to depart out of their territory.

## Matthew 9

1. Then having gone aboard the bark, he repassed, and went to his own city;

2. where they brought to him a paralytic, laid upon a bed. Jesus perceiving their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, take courage, your sins are forgiven you.

3. On which some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.

4. But Jesus knowing their sentiments, said, Why do you harbor evil thoughts?

5. Which is easier-to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, with effect -Arise and walk?

6. But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins; Arise, then, (said he to the paralytic,) take up your bed and go home.

7. Accordingly he arose, and went home.

8. And the people saw and wondered, glorifying God, who had given such power to men.

9. As Jesus departed thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the toll office; to whom he said, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.

10. Afterward Jesus being at table in a house, many publicans and sinners came, and placed themselves with him and his disciples.

11. Some of the Pharisees observing this, said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?

12. Jesus hearing them, answered, The whole need not a physician, but the sick.

13. «Go, therefore, and learn what this means,» 'I desire humanity, and not sacrifice:' 'for I came to call, not the righteous, but sinners.'

14. Then John's disciples addressing him, said, We and the Pharisees often fast: why do your disciples never fast?

15. Jesus answered, Can the bridesmen mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.

16. No person mends an old garment with undressed cloth; else the patch itself tears the garment, and makes a greater rent.

17. Neither do people put new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise the bottles burst: and thus, both the wine is spilt, and the bottles are rendered useless. But they put new wine into new bottles, and bother are preserved.

18. While he was speaking, a ruler came, and prostrating himself, said, My daughter is by this time dead; but come, and lay your hand upon her, and she will revive.

19. And Jesus arose, and, as he followed him, with his disciples,

20. a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with a bloody issue, coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle;

21. for she said within herself, If I but touch his mantle, I shall recover.

22. Jesus turning about, saw her, and said, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you. And the woman was well from that instant.

23. Being come into the ruler's house, and seeing the players on the flute, with the crowd, making a bustle,

24. he said to them, Withdraw, for the young woman is not dead, but asleep. And they derided him:

25. but when the people were put out, he entered, and having taken her by the hand, the young woman arose.

26. Now the fame of this action spread through all the country.

27. When Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, Son of David, have pity upon us.

28. Being come into the house, the blind men approached him: and Jesus said to them, Do you believe I can do this? They answered, Yes, Master.

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying, Be it to you according to your faith.

30. Immediately their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charging them, said, Take care that no person know it.

31. But being departed, they spread his fame through all that country.

32. They were scarcely gone, when a dumb demoniac was presented to him.

33. The demon being expelled, the dumb spoke, and the people wondered, saying, Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel.

34. But the Pharisees said, He expels the demons by the prince of the demons.

35. Then Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every disease and every malady.

36. But when he saw the multitudes, he had compassion upon them, because they were scattered and exposed, like a flock without a shepherd.

37. Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the reapers are few:

38. entreat, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers to reap it.

## Matthew 10

1. And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power to expel unclean spirits, and to cure diseases and maladies of every kind.

2. Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: The first, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James, son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, surnamed Thaddeus;

4. and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, he who betrayed him.

5. These twelve Jesus commissioned, instructing them, and saying: Go not away to the Gentiles, nor enter a Samaritan city;

6. but go directly to the lost sheep of the stock of Israel.

7. And as you go, proclaim, saying, The Reign of Heaven approaches.

8. Heal the sick, raise the dead; cleanse lepers, expel demons; freely they have received, freely give.

9. Put not gold or silver, or brass in your girdles;

10. carry no traveling bag, no spare coat, shoes, or staff; for the workman is worthy of his maintenance.

11. And whatever city or village you enter, inquire what person of worth dwells there; and abide with him until you leave the place.

12. When you enter the home, salute the family.

13. If the family be worthy, the peace you wish them shall come upon them: if they be not worthy, it shall rebound upon yourselves.

14. Wheresoever they will not receive you, nor regard your words, in departing that house or city, shake the dust off your feet.

15. Indeed, I say to you, the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment, than the condition of that city.

16. Behold! I send you forth as sheep amidst wolves. Be therefore prudent as the serpents, and harmless as the doves.

17. But be upon your guard against these men; for they will deliver you to councils, and scourge you in their synagogues;

18. and you shall be brought before governors and kings, on my account, to bear testimony to them, and to the Gentiles.

19. But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how, or what you shall speak; for what you shall speak shall be suggested to you in that moment.

20. For it shall not be you that shall speak; but the Spirit of my Father, who will speak by you.

21. Then the brother will deliver up the brother to death; and the father the child; and children will arise against their parents, and procure their death.

22. And for my name you shall be hated universally. But the man who perseveres to the end, shall be saved.

23. Therefore, when they persecute you in one city, flee to another; for indeed, I say to you, you shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be come.

24. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.

25. It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher, and for the servant to be as his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more his domestics?

26. Therefore, fear them not; for there is nothing hid that shall not be detected; nothing secret that shall not be known.

27. What I tell you in the dark, publish in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the house tops.

28. And fear not them you kill the body, but can not kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet neither of them falls to the ground without your Father.

30. Nay, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Fear not, then; you are much more valuable than sparrows.

32. Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge me before men, him will I also acknowledge before my Father, who is in heaven.

33. But whoever shall disown me before men, him will I also disown before my Father, who is in heaven.

34. Think not that I am come to bring peace to the earth. I came not to bring peace, but a sword.

35. For I am come to cause dissension between father and son, between mother and daughter, between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law;

36. so that a man's enemies will be found in his own family.

37. He who loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. He who loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.

38. He who will not take his cross and follow me, is not worthy of me.

39. He who preserves his life, shall lose it: but he who loses his life, on my account, shall preserve it.

40. He that receives you, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him who sent me, receives him who sent me.

41. He that receives a prophet, because he is a prophet, shall obtain a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man, because he is a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward:

42. and whosoever shall give one of these little ones, because he is my disciple, a single cup of cold water to drink; indeed, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.

## Matthew 11

1. When Jesus had made an end of instructing his twelve disciples, he departed thence, to teach and give warning in the cities.

2. Now John, having heard in prison of the works of the Messiah, sent two of his disciples,

3. who asked him, Are you he that comes, or must we expect another?

4. Jesus answering, said to them, Go, and relate to John, what you have heard and seen.

5. The blind are made to see, the lame to walk; lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; and good news is brought to the poor;

6. and happy is he, to whom I shall not prove a stumbling block.

7. When they were departed, Jesus said to the people concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?

8. But what did you go out to see? A man effeminately dressed? It is king's palaces that such frequent.

9. What did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and something superior to a prophet:

10. «for this is he, concerning whom it is written,'Behold I will send my angel before you, who shall prepare your way.'»

11. Indeed, I say to you, among those that are born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Immerser. Yet the least in the Reign of Heaven is greater than he.

12. From the first appearing of John the Immerser until now, the kingdom of heaven is invaded, and invaders take possession by force.

13. For till John appeared, all the prophets and the law were your instructions:

14. and, if you will bear to be told it, this is the Elijah that was to come.

15. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.

16. But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like boys in the market places, to whom their playfellows complain,

17. saying, We have played to you upon the pipe, but you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs to you, but you have not lamented.

18. For John came abstaining from meat and drink, and they say, He has a demon;

19. the Son of Man came using meat and drink, and they say, He is a lover of banquets and wine, a companion of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.

20. Then he began to reproach the cities, in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they reformed not.

21. Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles which have been performed in you, had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they had reformed long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

22. Know, therefore, that the condition of Tyre and Sidon, on the day of judgment, shall be more tolerable than yours.

23. And thou, Capernaum, which hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to Hades; for, if the miracles which have been performed in thee, had been performed in Sodom, it had remained till now.

24. Know, therefore, that the condition of Sodom, on the day of judgment, shall be more tolerable than thine.

25. On that occasion Jesus said, I adore thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because, having concealed these things from sages and the learned, thou hast revealed them to babes:

26. yes, Father, because such is thy pleasure.

27. My Father has imparted everything to me; and no one knows the Son, except the Father; neither knows any one the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

28. Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.

29. Take my yoke upon you, and be taught by me; for I am meek and condescending: and your souls shall find relief.

30. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

## Matthew 12

1. At that time, as Jesus was walking through the corn on Sabbath, his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat them.

2. The Pharisees observing this, said to him, Lo! your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.

3. He answered, Have you not read what David did, and his attendants, when they were hungry;

4. how he entered the tabernacle of God, and eat the loaves of the presence, which was not lawful for him, or his attendants, to eat but solely for the priests?

5. Or have you not learnt from the law, that the priests in the temple violate the rest to be observed on Sabbaths, and are blameless?

6. Now I affirm, that something greater than the temple is here.

7. «But had you know what this means,» 'I desire humanity and not sacrifice,' 'you would not have condemned the guiltless;'

8. for the Son of Man is master of the Sabbath.

9. Leaving that place, he went into their synagogue,

10. and found a man there whose hand was blasted. They asked Jesus, with a design to accuse him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?

11. He answered, What man is there amongst you, who having one sheep, if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

12. And does not a mean greatly excel a sheep? It is lawful, therefore, to do good on the Sabbath.

13. Then he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And as he stretched it out, it became sound like the other.

14. But the Pharisees went out, and concerted against Jesus to destroy him.

15. Jesus knowing this, departed; and being followed by a vast multitude, healed all their sick,

16. enjoining them not to make him known.

17. Thus the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,

18. «Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights; I will cause my Spirit to abide upon him, and he shall give laws to the nations;»

19. he will not contend, nor clamor, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets.

20. A bruised reed he will not break; and a dimly burning taper he will not quench, till he render his laws victorious.

21. «Nations also shall trust in his name.»

22. Then was brought to him a demoniac, dumb, and blind, and he cured him, so that he both spoke and saw.

23. And all the people said with amazement, Is this the son of David?

24. But the Pharisees hearing them, said, This man expels demons only by Beelzebub, prince of the demons.

25. But Jesus, knowing their surmises, said to them, By intestine dissensions any kingdom may be desolated; and no city or family, where such dissensions are, can subsist.

26. Now if Satan expel Satan, his kingdom is torn by intestine dissensions; how can it then subsist?

27. Besides, if I expel demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons expel them? Wherefore they shall be your judges.

28. But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God, the Reign of God has overtaken you.

29. For how can one enter the strong one's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first overpower the strong one? Then indeed he may plunder his house.

30. He who is not for me, is against me; and he who gathers not with me, scatters.

31. Wherefore I say to you, though every other sin and detraction in men is pardonable, their detraction from the Spirit is unpardonable:

32. for whosoever shall inveigh against the Son of Man may obtain pardon; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, shall never be pardoned, either in the present state or the future.

33. Either call the tree good, and its fruit good; or call the tree bad, and its fruit bad: for we distinguish the tree by its fruit.

34. Offspring of vipers! how can you that are evil speak good things, since it is out of the fullness of the heart that the mouth speaks.

35. The good man, out of his good treasure, produces good things; the bad man, out of his bad treasure, produces bad things.

36. Be assured, however, that of every pernicious word which men shall utter, they shall give an account on the day of judgment.

37. For by your words you shall be acquitted, and by your words you shall be condemned.

38. Then some of the Scribes and Pharisees interposed, saying, Rabbi, we desire to see a sign for you.

39. He answering, said to them, An evil and adulterous race demands a sign; but no sign shall be given it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonah.

40. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the bosom of the earth.

41. The Ninevites will stand up in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned, because they reformed when they were warned by Jonah; and behold here something greater than Jonah.

42. The Queen of the South country will arise in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned; because she came from the extremities of the earth to hear the wise discourses of Solomon; and behold here something greater than Solomon.

43. An unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, wanders over the parched deserts in search of a resting-place. And not finding any,

44. he says, I will return to my house whence I came; and being come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished.

45. Then he goes, and brings with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having entered, they dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first: thus will it fare with this evil race.

46. While he discoursed to the people, his mother and brothers were without, desiring to speak with him.

47. And one said to him, Your mother and your brothers are without, desiring to speak with you.

48. He answering, said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?

49. The stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brothers.

50. For whosoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, is my brother, and sister, and mother.

## Matthew 13

1. The same day, Jesus having gone out of the house, sat by the sea-side;

2. but so great a multitude flocked about him, that he went into a bark, and sat down there, while all the people stood on the shore.

3. Then he discoursed to them of many things in parables.

4. The sower, said he, went out to sow; and, in sowing, some seeds fell by the way-side, and the birds came and picked them up:

5. some fell on rocky ground, where they had but little earth: these sprang up the sooner, because the soil had no depth:

6. but after the sun had beat upon them, they were scorched, and having no root, withered away.

7. Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked them.

8. Others fell into good ground, and yielded increase, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold.

9. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.

10. Then the disciples addressed him, saying, Why do you speak to them in parables?

11. He answering, said to them, Because it is your privilege, and not theirs, to know the secrets of the Reign of Heaven.

12. For to him that has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken.

13. For this reason I speak to them in parables; because they seeing, see not; and hearing, hear not, nor regard;

14. «insomuch that this prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them,» 'You will indeed hear, but will not understand; you will look, but will not perceive.'

15. «For this people's understanding is stupefied, their ears are deafened, and their eyes they have closed; lest seeing with their eyes, hearing with their ears, and apprehending with their understanding, they should reform, and I should reclaim them.»

16. But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.

17. For, indeed, I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see, but have not seen them; and to hear the things which you hear, but have not heard them.

18. Understand you, therefore, the parable of the sower.

19. When one hears the doctrine of the Reign, but considers it not, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which was sown in his heart. This explains what fell by the way-side.

20. That which fell on rocky ground, denotes him who, hearing the word, receives it at first with pleasure;

21. yet, not having it rooted in his mind, retains it but a while; for when trouble or persecution comes, because of the word, instantly he relapses.

22. That which fell among thorns, denotes that hearer in whom worldly cares, and deceitful riches, choke the word, and render it unfruitful.

23. But that which fell into good soil, and bore fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold, denotes him, who not only hears and considers, but obeys the word.

24. Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a field, in which the proprietor has sown good grain:

25. but while people were asleep, his enemy came, and sowed darnel among the wheat, and went off.

26. When the blade was up, and putting forth the ear, then appeared also the darnel.

27. And the servants came, and said to their master, Sir, you sowed good grain in your field; whence, then, has it darnel?

28. He answered, An enemy has done this. They said, Will you, then, that we weed them out?

29. He replied, No, lest in weeding out the darnel, you tear up the wheat.

30. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, first gather the darnel, and make them into bundles for burning; then carry the wheat into my barn.

31. Another similitude he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man planted in his field;

32. for though it is the smallest of seeds, when grown, larger than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air take the shelter in its branches.

33. Another similitude he gave them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

34. All these similitudes Jesus spoke to the people; for he taught them only by similitudes;

35. «in this verifying the word of the Prophet,» 'I will discourse in parables; I will utter things concerning which, all antiquity has been silent.'

36. Then Jesus, leaving the multitude, retired to the house, where his disciples accosted him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field.

37. Jesus answering, said to them, He who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.

38. The field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; and the darnel are the sons of the evil one;

39. the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the conclusion of this state; and the reapers are the angels.

40. As, therefore, the darnel is gathered and burnt, so shall it be at the conclusion of this state.

41. The Son of Man will send his angels who shall gather out of his kingdom all seducers and iniquitous persons,

42. and throw them into the burning furnace: weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.

43. Then shall the righteous shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear let him hear.

44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which, when a man has discovered, he conceals the discovery, and for joy thereof, sells all that he has, and buys that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl extremely precious, which a merchant, in quest of fine pearls,

46. having found, sold all that he had, and purchased it.

47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a sweep-net cast into the seam which encloses fish of every kind.

48. When it is full, they draw it ashore, and gather the good into vessels, but throw the useless away.

49. So it shall be at the conclusion of this state. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,

50. and throw them into the burning furnace. Weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.

51. Jesus said, Do you understand all these things? They answered, Yes, Master.

52. He added, Every scribe, therefore, instructed for the Reign of Heaven, is like a householder, who brings out of his storehouse new things and old.

53. And after he had finished these similitudes, he departed thence.

54. Jesus being come into his own country, taught the inhabitants in their synagogue; and they said with astonishment, Whence has this man this wisdom, and this power of working miracles?

55. Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And do not his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas,

56. and all his sisters, live amongst us? Whence, then, has he all these things?

57. Thus they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is no where disregarded, except in his own country, and in his own family.

58. And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.

## Matthew 14

1. At that time, Herod the tetrarch, hearing of the fame of Jesus,

2. said to his servants, This is John the Immerser; he is raised from the dead and therefore miracles are performed by him.

3. For Herod had caused John to be apprehended, imprisoned, and bound, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;

4. for John had said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.

5. And Herod would have put him to death, but was afraid of the populace, who accounted him a prophet.

6. But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod,

7. wherefore he swore he would grant her whatever she would ask.

8. She being instigated by her mother, said, Give me here, in a basin, the head of John the Immerser.

9. And the king was sorry; nevertheless, from a regard to his oath and his guests, he commanded that it should be given her.

10. Accordingly John was beheaded in the prison by his order.

11. And his head was brought in a basin, and presented to the young woman; and she carried it to her mother.

12. After which, his disciples went and brought the body, and having buried it, came and told Jesus.

13. When Jesus heard this, he embarked privately; and retired into a desert place; of which the people being informed followed him by land out of the cities.

14. Observing, as he landed, a great multitude, he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.

15. Toward the evening, his disciples accosted him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past, dismiss the multitude, that they may go to the villages; and buy themselves provisions.

16. Jesus answered, They need not go. Supply them yourselves.

17. They said to him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.

18. He replied, Bring them hither to me.

19. Then having commanded the people to recline upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking toward heaven, blessed them; then breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them among the people.

20. When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.

21. Now they that had eat were about five thousand men; besides women and children.

22. Immediately he obliged the disciples to embark and pass over before him, while he dismissed the multitude.

23. Having dismissed the multitude, he retired by himself to a mountain to pray, and remained there alone.

24. By that time the bark was half way over, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.

25. In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.

26. When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, being terrified, they exclaimed, An apparition! and cried out for fear.

27. Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I, be not afraid.

28. Peter answering, said to him, If it be you, Master, bid me to come to you on the water.

29. Jesus said, Come. Then Peter getting out of the bark, walked on the water toward Jesus.

30. But finding the wind boisterous, he was frightened; and beginning to sink, cried, Master, save me.

31. Jesus instantly stretching out his hand, caught him; and said to him, Distrustful man, wherefore did you doubt?

32. When they had gone aboard, the wind ceased.

33. Then those in the bark came, and prostrated themselves before him, saying, You are assuredly God's son.

34. Having passed over, they landed on the territory of Gennesaret;

35. the inhabitants of which knowing him, sent through all that country, and brought to him all the diseased,

36. who besought him to let them touch but a tuft of his mantle; and as man as touched were cured.

## Matthew 15

1. Then some Scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem addressed him, saying,

2. Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders; for they was not their hands before meals.

3. Jesus answering, said to them, Why do you yourselves by your tradition, transgress the commandment of God?

4. «For God has commanded, saying,'Honor father and mother'; and'Whosoever reviles father or mother, let him be punished with death.'»

5. But you affirm, If a man say to father or mother, I devote whatever of mine shall profit you,

6. he shall not afterward honor by his assistance, his father or his mother. Thus, by your tradition, you annul the commandment of God.

7. Hypocrites, well do you suit the character which Isaiah gave of you, saying,

8. «This people honor me with their lips. though their heart is estranged from me.»

9. «But in vain they worship me, while they teach institutions merely human.»

10. Then, having called the multitude, he said to them, Hear, and be instructed.

11. It is not what goes into the mouth pollutes the man; but it is what proceeds out of the mouth, that pollutes the man.

12. On which his disciples accosting him, said, Did you observe how the Pharisees, when they heard that saying were offended?

13. He answered, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be extirpated.

14. Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.

15. Then Peter addressing him, said, Explain to us that parable.

16. Jesus answered, Are you also void of understanding?

17. Do you not apprehend, that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach, and is thrown out into the sink.

18. But that which proceeds out of the mouth, issues from the heart, and so pollutes the man.

19. For out of the heart proceed malicious contrivances, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, calumnies.

20. These are the things which pollute the man; but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not the man.

21. Then Jesus withdrew into the confines of Tyre and Sidon;

22. and behold! a Canaanitish woman of these territories came to him, crying, Master, Son of David, have pity on me; my daughter is grievously afflicted by a demon.

23. But he gave her no answer. Then his disciples interposed, and entreated him, saying, Dismiss her, for she clamors after us.

24. He answering said, My mission is only to the lost sheep of the stock of Israel.

25. She, nevertheless, advanced, and prostrating herself before him, said, O Lord, help me.

26. He replied, It is not seemly to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs.

27. True, Sir, returned she. Yet even the dogs are allowed the crumbs which fall from their master's table.

28. Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman! great is your faith. Be it to you as you desire. And that instant her daughter was healed.

29. Jesus having left that place, came nigh to the sea of Galilee, and repaired to a mountain, where he sat down;

30. and great multitudes flocked to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the cripple, and several others, whom they laid at his feet; and he healed them:

31. insomuch that the people beheld, with admiration, the dumb speaking, the cripple sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. Then Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude because they have now attended me three days, and have nothing to eat; I will not dismiss them fasting, lest they faint by the way.

33. His disciples answered, Whence can we get bread enough, in the solitude, to satisfy such a crowd?

34. He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven, and a few small fishes.

35. Then commanding the people to recline upon the ground,

36. he took the seven loaves and the fishes, which, having given thanks, he divided and gave to his disciples, who distributed them among the people.

37. When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off seven hand-baskets full of the fragments that remained.

38. Now they that had eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.

39. Then having dismissed the multitude, he embarked, and sailed to the coast of Magdala.

## Matthew 16

1. Thither some Pharisees and Sadducees repaired, who, to try him, desired that he would show them a sign in the sky.

2. He answering, said to them, In the evening you say, it will be fair weather, for the sky is red:

3. and in the morning, There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and lowering. You can judge aright of the appearance of the sky, but can you not discern the signs of the times?

4. An evil and adulterous race demands a sign, but no sign shall be given it, except the sign of the Prophet Jonah. Then leaving them he departed.

5. Now his disciples, before they came over, had forgot to bring loaves with them.

6. Jesus said to them, Take head, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

7. On which they said, reasoning among themselves, This is because we have brought no loaves with us.

8. Jesus perceiving it, said, What do you reason amongst yourselves, O you distrustful! that I speak thus, because you have brought no loaves.

9. Have you no reflection? or do you not remember the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets you filled with the fragments:

10. nor the seven loaves among the four thousand, and how many hand-baskets you filled?

11. How is it, that you do not understand, that I spoke not concerning bread, when I bade you beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

12. Then they understood, that he cautioned them not against the leaven which the Pharisees and the Sadducees used in bread, but against their doctrine.

13. As Jesus was going to the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?

14. They answered, Some say, John the Immerser; others, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or one of the Prophets.

15. But who, returned he, do you say that I am?

16. Simon Peter answering, said, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.

17. Jesus replying, said to him, Happy are you, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.

18. I tell you, likewise, you are named Stone; and on this rock I will build my congregation, over which the gates of Hades shall not prevail.

19. Moreover, I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

20. Then he forbade his disciples to tell any many that he is the Messiah.

21. From that time Jesus began to disclose to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer much from the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and that he must be raised the third day.

22. On which, Peter taking him aside, reproved him, saying, Be this far from you, Master; this shall not befall you.

23. But he turning, said to Peter, Get you thence, adversary, you are an obstacle in my way; for you relish not the things of God, but the things of men.

24. Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For, whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.

26. What is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, with the forfeit of his life? or what will a man not give in ransom for his life?

27. For the Son of Man, vested with his Father's glory, shall come hereafter with his heavenly messengers, and recompense every one according to his actions.

28. Indeed, I say to you, some of those who are present, shall not taste death, until they see the Son of Man enter upon his Reign.

## Matthew 17

1. After six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, brother of James, apart to the top of a high mountain,

2. and was transfigured in their presence, His face shone as the sun; and his raiment became white as the light.

3. And presently appeared to them Moses and Elijah conversing with him.

4. Peter, upon this, addressing Jesus, said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us make here, if you will, three booths; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

5. While he was speaking, behold! a bright cloud covered them, and out of the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight; hear him.

6. The disciples, hearing this, fell upon their faces, and were greatly frightened.

7. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, Arise; be not afraid.

8. Then lifting up their eyes, they saw none but Jesus.

9. As they went down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell no person what you have seen, until the Son of Man rise from the dead.

10. Then the disciples asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must come first?

11. Jesus answering, said to them, To consummate the whole, Elijah, indeed, must come first.

12. But I tell you, Elijah is come already, though they did not acknowledge him, but have treated him as they pleased. Thus they will treat the Son of Man also.

13. Then the disciple understood, that he spoke concerning John the Immerser.

14. When they were come to the multitude, a man came to him, who kneeling, said,

15. Sir, have pity on my son; for he is grievously distressed with lunacy; often he falls into the fire, and often into the water,

16. and I presented him to your disciples; but they could not cure him.

17. Jesus answering, said, O unbelieving and perverse race! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.

18. Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out: and the lad was instantly cured.

19. At that time the disciple came to him privately, saying, Why could not we expel the demon?

20. Jesus answered, Because of your unbelief; for, indeed, I say to you, if you had faith, though but as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mountain, Remove to yonder place, and it would remove: yes, nothing would be impossible to you.

21. This kind, however, is not dispossessed, unless by prayer and fasting.

22. While they remained in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is to be delivered up to men,

23. who will kill him: but the third day he shall be raised again. And they were grieved exceedingly.

24. When they were come to Capernaum, the collectors came and asked Peter, Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?

25. He said, Yes. Being come into the house, before he spoke, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth exact tribute or custom? from their own sons, or from others?

26. Peter answered, From others. Jesus replied, The sons then are exempted.

27. Nevertheless, lest we shall give them offense, go to the sea and throw a line, draw out the first fish that is hooked, and, having opened its mouth, you shall find a stater; take that, and give it to them for me and you.

## Matthew 18

1. At that time the disciples came to Jesus inquiring, Who shall be the greatest in the Reign of Heaven?

2. Jesus calling to him a child, placed him in the midst of them,

3. and said, Indeed, I say to you, unless you be changed, and become as children, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.

4. Whosoever, therefore, shall become humble like this child.

5. Nay, whosoever receives one such child, in my name, receives me:

6. but whosoever shall ensnare any of these little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were sunk in the ocean.

7. Alas for the world because of snares! Snares indeed there must be; nevertheless, alas for the ensnarer!

8. Wherefore, if your hand or foot ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter lame or maimed into life, than having two hands or feet to be cast into the everlasting fire.

9. And if your eye ensnare you, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter one-eyed into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

10. Beware of contemning any of these little ones; for I assure you, that in heaven, their angels continually behold the face of my heavenly Father:

11. and the Son of Man is come to recover the lost.

12. What think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them has strayed, will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and go in quest of the stray?

13. And if he happens to find it, indeed, I say to you, he derives greater joy from it, than from the ninety-nine which went not astray.

14. Thus it is not the will of your Father in heaven, that any of these little ones should be lost.

15. Wherefore, if your brother trespass against you, go and expostulate with him, when you and he are alone together. If he hear you, you have gained your brother;

16. but if he will not hear, take one or two along with you, that by the testimony of two or three witnesses everything may be ascertained.

17. If he despises them, tell the congregation; and if he despise the congregation also, let him be to you as a pagan or a publican.

18. Indeed, I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

19. Again, I say to you, whatever two of you upon the earth shall agree to ask, shall be granted them by my Father, who is in heaven.

20. For wherever two or three are assembled in my name, I am in the midst of them.

21. Then Peter approaching, said to him, Master, if my brother repeatedly trespass against me, how often must I forgive him? must I seven times?

22. Jesus answered, I say to you, not seven times, but seventy times seven times.

23. In this the Administration of Heaven resembles a king, who determined to settle accounts with his servants.

24. Having begun to reckon, one was brought, who owed him ten thousand talents.

25. But that servant not having the means to pay; his master, to obtain payment, commanded that he, and his wife and children, and all that he had should be sold.

26. Then the servant, throwing himself prostrate before his master, cried, Have patience with me, my lord, and I will pay the whole.

27. And his master had compassion upon him, and dismissed him, remitting the debt.

28. But this servant, as he went out, meeting one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii, seized him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.

29. His fellow-servant, falling down, besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you.

30. And he would not, but instantly caused him to be imprisoned, until he should discharge the debt.

31. His fellow-servants seeing this, were deeply affected, and went, and informed their master of all that had passed.

32. Then his master, having given orders to call him, said to him, You wicked servant: all that debt I forgave you, because you besought me.

33. Ought not you to have shown such pity to your fellow-servant, as I showed to you?

34. So his master, being provoked, delivered him to the jailors, to remain in their hands until he should clear the debt.

35. Thus will my heavenly Father treat every one of you, who forgives not, from his heart, his brother.

## Matthew 19

1. When Jesus had ended this discourse, he left Galilee, and came to the confines of Judea, upon the Jordan,

2. whither great multitudes followed him, and he healed their sick.

3. Then some Pharisees came to him, and trying him asked, Can a man lawfully, upon every pretense, divorce his wife?

4. He answered, Have you not read, that at the beginning, when the Creator made man, he formed a male and a female,

5. «and said,'For this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and adhere to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.'»

6. Wherefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What, then, God has conjoined, let not man separate.

7. They replied, Why, then, did Moses command to give a writing of divorce, and dismiss her?

8. He answered, Moses, indeed, because of your intractable disposition, permitted you to divorce your wives, but it was not so from the beginning.

9. Therefore, I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for whoredom, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries the woman divorced, commits adultery.

10. His disciples said to him, If such be the condition of the husband, it is better to live unmarried.

11. He answered, They alone are capable of living thus, on whom the power is conferred.

12. For some are eunuchs from their birth; others have been made eunuchs by men; and others, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, have made themselves eunuchs. Let him act this part who can act it.

13. Then children were presented to him, that he might lay his hands on them, and pray, but the disciples reproved them.

14. Jesus said, Let the children alone, and hinder them not from coming to me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

15. And having laid his hands on them, he departed thence.

16. Afterward, one approaching, said to him, Good Teacher, what good must I do to obtain eternal life?

17. He answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good. If you would enter into that life, keep the commandments.

18. «He said to him, Which? Jesus answered, » 'You shall not commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony.'

19. «Honor father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself.»

20. The young man replied, All these I have observed from my childhood. In what am I still deficient?

21. Jesus answered, If you would be perfect, go sell your estate, and give the price to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven.

22. The young man hearing this, went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.

23. Then Jesus said to his disciples, Indeed, I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:

24. I say further, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.

25. The disciples, who heard this with amazement, said, Who then can be saved?

26. Jesus, looking at them, answered, With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.

27. Then Peter replying, said, As for us, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what then shall be our reward?

28. Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that at the Renovation, when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting upon the twelve thrones, shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. And whoever shall have forsaken, on my account, houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, shall receive a hundred fold, and inherit eternal life.

30. But many shall be first that are last, and last that are first.

## Matthew 20

1. For the Administration of Heaven will resemble the conduct of a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.

2. Having agreed with some for a denarius a-day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. About the third hour he went out, and seeing others unemployed in the market place,

4. said to them, Go you likewise into my vineyard, and I will give you what is reasonable. Accordingly they went.

5. Again, about the sixth hour, and about the ninth, he went out and did the same.

6. Lastly, about the eleventh hour, he went out, and finding others standing, said to them, Why do you stand here all the day doing nothing?

7. They answered, Because no person has hired us. He said to them, Go you also into my vineyard, and you shall receive what is reasonable.

8. When it was night, the proprietor of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.

9. Then they who had been hired at the eleventh hour came, and received each a denarius.

10. When the first came, they imagined they should receive more; but they got only a denarius a-piece.

11. Upon receiving it, they murmured against the householder,

12. saying, These last have worked but one hour; yet you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.

13. He answering, said to one of them, Friend, I do you no injury. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

14. Take what is yours, and depart. It is my will to give to this last as much as to you.

15. And may not I do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil, because I am good?

16. Thus the last shall be first, and first last; for there are many called, but few chosen.

17. When Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside, and said to them,

18. We are now going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, who will condemn him to die,

19. and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified; but the third day he will rise again.

20. Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to him with her sons, and, prostrating herself, entreated he would grant the request she had to make.

21. He said to her, What do you wish? She answered, That, in your Reign, one of these my two sons may sit at your right hand, the other at your left.

22. Jesus replying, said, You know not what you ask. Can you drink such a cup as I must drink? They said to him, We can.

23. He answered, You shall indeed drink such a cup. But to sit on my right hand, and at my left, I can not give, unless to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.

24. The then, hearing this, were full of indignation against the two brothers;

25. but Jesus, calling them to him, said, You know that the Princes of the nations domineer over them, and the great exercise their authority upon them.

26. It must not be so amongst you: on the contrary, whosoever would become great amongst you, let him be your servant;

27. and whosoever would be chief amongst you, let him be your slave:

28. even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

29. As they left Jericho, followed by a great multitude,

30. two blind men, who sat by the way-side, hearing that Jesus passed by cried, saying, Master, Son of David, have pity on us.

31. The multitude charged them to be silent: but they cried the louder, saying, Master, Son of David, have pity on us.

32. Then Jesus stopping, called them, and said, What do you want me to do for you?

33. They answered, Sir, to make us see.

34. Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. Immediately they received sight, and followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. When they were nigh Jerusalem, being come to Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,

2. saying, Go to the village opposite to you, where you will find an ass tied, and her colt with her; loose them, and bring them hither.

3. If any man say anything to you, say, Your Master wants them, and he will send them directly.

4. Now all this was done, that the words of the Prophet might be fulfilled,

5. «Say to the daughters of Zion, behold your King comes to you lowly, riding on an ass, even the colt of a laboring beast.»

6. Accordingly the disciples went, and having done as Jesus had commanded them,

7. brought the ass and the colt, and covering them with their mantles, made him ride.

8. Now the greater part spread their mantles in the way; others lopped branches off the trees, and strowed them in the way,

9. while the crowd that went before and that followed, shouted, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!

10. When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, everybody asking, Who is this?

11. The crowd answered, It is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth, in Galilee.

12. Then Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove thence all who sold and who brought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the stalls of those who sold doves,

13. «and said to them, It is written,'My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»

14. Then the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.

15. But the chief priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders which he performed, and the boys crying in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David,

16. «said to him with indignation, Do you hear what these say? Jesus answered, Yes. Have you never read,'From the mouth of infants and sucklings thou hast procured praise?'»

17. And leaving them, he went out of the city of Bethany, where he remained that night.

18. Returning to the city in the morning, he was hungry,

19. and seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it; but finding only leaves on it, said, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward. And the fig tree withered forthwith.

20. When the disciples saw it, they said with astonishment, how soon is the fig tree withered?

21. Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, if you have an unshaken faith, you may not only do as much as is done to the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, Be lifted up, and thrown into the sea, it shall be done.

22. Whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, with faith, you shall receive.

23. Being come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came near, as he was teaching, and said, by what authority do you these things?

24. Jesus answering, said to them, I also have a question to propose, which if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. Whence had John authority to immerse? From heaven or from men? Then they reasoned thus within themselves: If we say, From heaven, he will retort, Why then did you not believe him?

26. And if we say, From men, we dread the multitude, amongst whom John is universally accounted a prophet.

27. They, therefore, answered him, We can not tell. Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these things.

28. But what do you think of this? A man had two sons, and addressing his elder son, said, Son, go work today in any vineyard.

29. He answered, I will not, but afterward repented and went.

30. Then addressing the younger, he bade him likewise. He answered, Immediately, Sir, but went not.

31. Now, which of the two obeyed his father? They said, The first. Jesus replied, Indeed, I say to you, even the publicans and harlots show you the way into the kingdom of God.

32. For John came to you in the way of sanctity, and you believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: yet you who saw this, did not afterward repent and believe him.

33. Hear another parable: A landlord planted a vineyard, and hedged it round, and digged a wine press in it, and built a tower; and having farmed it out, went abroad.

34. When the vintage approached, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive the fruits.

35. But they seized his servants, beat one, drove away with stones another, and killed another.

36. Again he sent other servants more respectable; but they received the same treatment;

37. finally he sent his son to them: for he said, They will reverence my son.

38. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and keep possession of his inheritance.

39. Then they seized him, thrust him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

40. When, therefore, the proprietor of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen?

41. They answered, He will put those wretched to a wretched death, and will let the vineyard to others, who will render him the fruits in the season.

42. «Jesus replied, Did you never read in the scriptures,'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner? This the Lord has effected, and we behold it with admiration.'»

43. Know, therefore, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation who will produce the fruits of it.

44. For whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be bruised; and on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces.

45. The chief priests and the Pharisees hearing his parables, perceived that he spoke of them;

46. but though they wished to lay hold on him, they were afraid of the populace, who reckoned him a prophet.

## Matthew 22

1. Jesus continuing to discourse to them in parables, said,

2. The Administration of Heaven resembles the conduct of a king, who having made a marriage feast for his son,

3. sent his servants to call them, who had been invited; but they would not come.

4. Then he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited I have prepared my feast; my bullocks and fatlings are slain, and all is ready; come to the marriage.

5. But they turned away with indifference, one to his farm, another to his merchandize.

6. And the rest seizing his servants, abused and killed them.

7. When the king heard this, being enraged, he sent his soldiers, destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.

8. Then he said to his servants, The entertainment is ready; but they who were invited were not worthy:

9. go therefore, into the public roads, and all that you can find, invited to the marriage.

10. Accordingly they went into the highways, and assembled all that they found, good and bad, so that the hall was furnished with guests.

11. When the king came in to see the guests, observing one who had not on a wedding garment,

12. he said to him, Friend, how came you here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

13. Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and thrust him out into darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth;

14. for there are many called, but few chosen.

15. Then the Pharisees retired, and having consulted how they might entrap him in his words,

16. sent to him some of their disciples, and some Herodians, who being instructed by them, said, Rabbi, we know that you are sincere, and faithfully teach the way of God, without partiality, for you respect not the person of men.

17. Tell us, therefore, your opinion: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?

18. Jesus, perceiving their malice, said, Dissemblers, why would you entangle me?

19. Show me the tribute money. And they reached him a denarius.

20. He asked them, Whose image and inscription is this?

21. They answered, Cesar's. He replied, Render, then, to Cesar that which is Cesar's, and to God that which is God's.

22. And admiring his answer, they left him, and went away.

23. The same day Sadducees, who say that there is no future life, came to him and addressed him:

24. Rabbi, Moses has said, if one die, and have no children, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise issue to the deceased.

25. Now there lived among us seven brothers; the eldest married and died without issue, leaving his wife to his brother.

26. Thus also the second, and the third, and so to the seventh.

27. Last of all the woman died also.

28. Now, at the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven; for they all married her?

29. Jesus answering, said to them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God;

30. for in that state, they neither marry, nor give in marriage: they resemble the angels of God.

31. But as to the revival of the dead, have you not read what God declared to you, saying,

32. «I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?» 'God is not a God of the dead, but of the living.'

33. Now, the people who heard this, were struck with awe at his doctrine.

34. Meantime, the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, flocked about him.

35. Then, one of them, a lawyer, trying him, proposed this question,

36. Rabbi, which is the greatest commandment in the law?

37. «Jesus answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.»

38. This is the first and greatest commandment.

39. «The second is like it,'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'»

40. On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.

41. While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,

42. saying, What do you think of the Messiah? Who son should he be? They answered, David's.

43. He replied, How then does David, speaking by inspiration, call him his Lord?

44. «The Lord,» 'says he, '«said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your foes your footstool.»

45. If the Messiah were David's son, would David call him his Lord?

46. To this none of them could answer; and from that day no person presumed to interrogate him.

## Matthew 23

1. Then Jesus addressed the people and his disciples,

2. saying, The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' chair;

3. therefore observe and do whatsoever they enjoin you; nevertheless, follow not their example; for they say and do not.

4. Heavy and intolerable burdens they prepare for other men's shoulders, burdens to which they themselves will not put a finger.

5. But whatever they do they do to be observed by men. For this they wear broader phylacteries than others, and larger tufts on their mantles;

6. and love the uppermost places at entertainments, and the principal seats in the synagogues,

7. and salutations in public places; and to hear men addressing them, cry, Rabbi, Rabbi.

8. But as for you, assume not the title of Rabbi; for you have only one teacher;

9. and style no man on earth your father, for he alone is your Father, who is in heaven; and all you are brothers.

10. Neither assume the title of leaders, for you have only one leader-who is the Messiah.

11. The greatest of you, on the contrary, shall be your servant;

12. for whosoever will exalt himself, shall be humbled; and whosoever will humble himself, shall be exalted.

13. But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; and will neither enter yourselves, nor permit others that would, to enter.

14. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrite! because you devour the families of widows; and use long prayers for a disguise. This will but aggravate your punishment.

15. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you traverse sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is gained, you make him a son of hell doubly more than yourselves.

16. Alas for you, blind guides, who say, To swear by the temple binds not, but swear by the gold of the temple is binding.

17. Foolish and blind! which is more sacred, the gold, or the temple that consecrates the gold?

18. and, to swear by the altar, binds not, but to swear by the offering that is upon it is binding.

19. Foolish and blind! which is more sacred, the offering, or the altar that consecrates the offering?

20. Whoever, therefore, swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.

21. And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it, and by Him who dwells in it;

22. and whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by Him who sits on it.

23. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you pay the tithe of mint, dill, and cummin, and omit the more important articles of the law, justice, humanity, and fidelity. These you ought to have practiced without omitting those.

24. Blind guides! you are skimming off the gnat, and swallowing the camel.

25. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you cleanse the outside of those cups and platters, which within are laid with rapine and iniquity.

26. Blind Pharisee! begin with cleansing the inside of the cup, and of the platter, if you would make even the outside clean.

27. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you resemble whitened sepulchers, which without indeed, are beautiful, but within are full of corruption, and of dead men's bones.

28. Thus you outwardly appear righteous to men; but are inwardly fraught with subtlety and injustice.

29. Alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the righteous,

30. and say, Had we lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been their accomplices in the slaughter of the prophets.

31. Thus you testify against yourself, that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.

32. Fill you up, then, the measure of your fathers.

33. Ah! serpents, offspring of vipers! how can you escape the punishment of hell?

34. Therefore, I send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will scourge in your synagogues, and banish from city to city;

35. so that all the innocent blood shed upon the earth shall be charged upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you slew between the altar and the sanctuary.

36. Indeed, I say to you, all shall be charged upon this generation.

37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! who killest the prophets, and stonest them whom God sends to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you would not!

38. Soon shall your habitation be turned into a desert;

39. for know, that you shall not henceforth see me, until you say, Blessed be He, who comes in the name of the Lord.

## Matthew 24

1. As Jesus walked out of the temple, his disciples came, and caused him to observe the buildings of it.

2. Jesus said to them, All this you see; indeed I say to you, one stone shall not be left here upon another. All shall be razed.

3. As he sat upon the Mount of Olives his disciples addressed him privately, saying, Tell us, when will this happen; and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the conclusion of this state?

4. Jesus answering, said to them, Take heed that no man seduce you:

5. for many will assume my character, saying, I am the Messiah, and will seduce many.

6. Nay, you shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars; but take care that you be not alarmed: for all these things must happen; but the end is not yet.

7. For nation will arise against nation; and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and pestilences, and earthquakes in sundry places.

8. Yet these are but the prelude of woes.

9. For they will deliver you to torments and to death, and you shall be hated by all nations on my account.

10. Then many will be ensnared, and will betray their fellows, and hate them.

11. And many false prophets will arise, who will seduce many.

12. And because vice will abound, the love of the greater number will cool.

13. But the man who perseveres to the end shall be saved.

14. And this gospel of the Reign shall be published through all the world, for the information of all nations. And then shall come the end.

15. When, therefore, you shall see, on holy ground, the desolating abomination foretold by the Prophet Daniel, (reader, attend!)

16. then let those in Judea flee to the mountains:

17. let not him, who shall be upon the housetop, come down to carry things out of his house;

18. and let not him, who shall be in the field, return to take his mantle.

19. But alas for the women with child, and for them that give suck in those days!

20. Pray, therefore, that your flight happen not in the winter, nor on a Sabbath;

21. because there shall be then so great tribulation, as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, nor shall be ever after.

22. For, if the time were protracted, no soul could survive; but for the sake of the elect, the time will be short.

23. If any man shall say to you then, Lo! the Messiah is here, or he is there, believe it not:

24. for false Messiahs and false prophets will arise, who will perform great wonders and prodigies, so as to seduce, if possible, the elect themselves.

25. Remember, I have warned you.

26. Wherefore, if they say, He is in the desert, go not out. He is in the closet, believe it not.

27. For the coming of the Son of Man shall be like lightning, which breaking forth from the east, shines even to the west.

28. For wheresoever the carcass is, the eagles will be gathered together.

29. Immediately after those days of affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall withhold her light; and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the heavenly powers shall be shaken.

30. Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and all the tribes of the land shall mourn, when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with great majesty and power.

31. And he will send his messengers with a loud sounding trumpet, who shall assemble his elect from the four quarters of the earth, from one extremity of the world to the other.

32. Learn now a similitude from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and put forth leaves, you know that summer is nigh.

33. In like manner, when you shall see all these things, know that he is near, even at the door.

34. Indeed, I say to you, this race shall not pass, until all these things happen.

35. Heaven and earth shall fail; but my words shall never fail.

36. But of that day, and that hour, know none, but the Father; no, not the angels.

37. Now that which happened in Noah's time, will also happen at the coming of the Son of Man.

38. For as in the days before the flood, even to that day that Noah entered the ark, they were eating and drinking, and marrying,

39. and suspected nothing, until the flood came and swept them all away: so shall it also be at the coming of the Son of Man.

40. Two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken, and one shall be left.

41. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one shall be taken, and one shall be left.

42. Watch, therefore, since you know not at what hour your master will come.

43. You are sure, that if the householder knew at what time of the night the thief would come, he would watch, and not suffer him to break into his house.

44. Be you, therefore, always prepared; because the Son of Man will come at an hour, when you are not expecting him.

45. Who, now, is the discreet and faithful servant, whom his master has set over his household, to dispense to them regularly their allowance?

46. Happy that servant, if his master, at his return, find him so employed.

47. Indeed, I say to you, he will entrust him with the management of all his estate.

48. But as to the vicious servant, who shall say within himself, My master defers his return,

49. and shall beat his fellow-servants, and feast and carouse with drunkards;

50. the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour of which he is not apprised,

51. and having discarded him, will assign him his portion among the perfidious. Weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.

## Matthew 25

1. Then may the kingdom of heaven be compared to ten virgins, who went out with their lamps to meet the bridegroom.

2. Of these, five were prudent and five foolish.

3. The foolish took their lamps, but carried no oil with them.

4. But the prudent, besides their lamps, carried oil in their vessels.

5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all became drowsy, and fell asleep.

6. And at midnight a cry was raised, The bridegroom is coming, go out and meet him.

7. Then all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.

8. And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.

9. But the prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and you, go rather to them who sell, and buy for yourselves.

10. While they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.

11. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Master, Master, open to us.

12. He answered, Indeed, I say to you, I know you not.

13. Watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.

14. For the Son of Man is like one who intending to travel, called his servants, and committed to them his stock;

15. to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his respective ability, and immediately set out.

16. Then he who had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and gained five others.

17. Likewise he who had received two, gained other two.

18. Whereas he who had received but one, digged a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

19. After a long time, their master returned and reckoned with them.

20. Then he who had received the five talents, came and presented five other talents, saying, Sir, you delivered to me five talents; here they are, and five other talents which I have gained.

21. His master answered, Well done, good and faithful servant, you have been faithful in a small matter, I will give you a more important trust. Partake you of your master's joy.

22. He, also, who had received the two talents, advancing said, Sir, you delivered to me two talents: here they are, and two other talents which I have gained.

23. His master answered, Well done, good and faithful servant, you have been faithful in a small matter, I will give you a more important trust. Partake you of your master's joy.

24. Then came he also who had received the talent, and said, Sir, I know that you are a severe man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered;

25. being therefore afraid, I hid your talent under ground; but now I restore you your own.

26. His master answering, said to him, Malignant and slothful servant, did you know that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered?

27. Should you not then have given my money to the bankers, that, at my return, I might have received it with interest?

28. Take from him, therefore, the talent, and give it to him who has ten:

29. for to every one that has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken.

30. And thrust out this unprofitable servant into darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

31. Now when the Son of Man shall come in his glory, accompanied by all the angels, and shall be seated on his glorious throne;

32. then shall all the nations be assembled before him; and out of them he will separate the good from the bad, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

33. The sheep he will set at his right hand, and the goats at his left.

34. Then will the King say to those at his right hand: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

35. for I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you lodged me; I was a stranger, and you lodged me;

36. I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick and you assisted me; I was in prison, and you visited me.

37. Then the righteous will answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee; or thirsty, and give thee drink?

38. When did we see thee a stranger, and lodged thee; or naked, and clothed thee?

39. When did we see thee sick, or in prison, and visited thee?

40. The King will reply to them, Indeed, I say to you, that inasmuch as you have done this to any the least of these my brethren, you have done it to me.

41. Then he will say to those at his left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his messengers;

42. for I was hungry, but you gave me no food; thirsty, but you gave me no drink;

43. I was a stranger, but you did not lodge me; naked, but you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, but you did not visit me.

44. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not assist thee?

45. Then he will reply to them, saying, Indeed, I say to you, that inasmuch as you did it not to any the least of these, you did it not to me.

46. And these shall go into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

## Matthew 26

1. Jesus, having ended this discourse, said to his disciples,

2. You know that two days hence comes the passover. Then the Son of Man shall be delivered up to be crucified.

3. About this time the chief priests and scribes, and the elders of the people, were convened in the palace of Caiaphas the high priest,

4. where they consulted how they might take Jesus by surprise, and kill him.

5. They said, however, not during the festival, lest there be a commotion among the people.

6. Now Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon, formerly a leper,

7. a woman came to him with an alabaster box of balsam, very precious, which she poured on his head while he was at table.

8. His disciples observing it, said, with indignation, Why this profusion?

9. This might have been sold for a great price, and the money given to the poor.

10. Jesus knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good office.

11. For you have the poor always amongst you, but me you have not always.

12. For it is to embalm me, that she has poured this balsam upon my body.

13. Indeed, I say to you, in what part soever of the world the gospel shall be preached, what this woman has now done, shall be mentioned to her honor.

14. Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,

15. and said, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed to him thirty shekels.

16. And from that time he watched an opportunity to deliver him up.

17. Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where shall we prepare for you the paschal supper?

18. He answered, Go into the city, to such a man, and tell him, The Teacher says, My time is near; I must celebrate the passover at your house with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did as they were ordered, and prepared the passover.

20. In the evening he placed himself at table with the twelve;

21. and while they were eating, he said, Indeed, I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up.

22. And they were extremely sorrowful, and began every one of them to say, Master, is it I?

23. He answering, said, The man, whose hand is in the dish with mine, is he who betrays me.

24. The Son of Man departs in the manner foretold in the scripture concerning him; but alas for that man, by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! it had been better for that man never to have been born.

25. Then Judas, who betrayed him, said also, Rabbi, is it I?

26. As they were eating, Jesus took the loaf; and having given thanks, broke it; and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

27. Then he took the cup, and, having given thanks, gave it to them, saying, Drink of this all of you:

28. for this is my blood, the blood of the new institution, shed for many, for the remission of sins.

29. I assure you, that I will not henceforth drink of the product of the vine, until the day when I shall drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

30. And after the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

31. «Then Jesus said to them, This night I shall prove a stumbling stone to you all; for it is written,'I will smite the Shepherd, and the flock will disperse.'»

32. But after I am raised again, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. Peter, then, said to him, Though you should prove a stumbling stone to them all, I never will be made to stumble.

34. Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that this very night, before the cock crow, you will thrice disown me.

35. Peter replied, Although I should die with you, I never will disown you. And all the disciples said the same.

36. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, Stay here, while I go yonder and pray.

37. And he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee; and being oppressed with grief,

38. said to them, My soul is overwhelmed with a deadly anguish; abide here, and watch with me.

39. And going a little before, he threw himself on his face, and praying, said, My Father, remove this cup from me, if it be possible; nevertheless, not as I would, but as thou wilt.

40. And he returned to his disciples, and finding them asleep, said to Peter, Is it so, then, that you could not keep awake with me a single hour?

41. Watch and pray, that you be not overcome by temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. A second time he withdrew and prayed, saying, O my Father, if there be no exemption for me; if I must drink this cup, thy will be done.

43. Upon his return, he again found them sleeping, (for their eyes were overpowered.)

44. Again, leaving them, he went and prayed the third time, using the same words.

45. Then he came back to his disciples, and said to them, Do you sleep now, and take your rest? Behold, the hour approaches, when the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinners.

46. Arise, let us be going; lo! he who betrays me is at hand.

47. Before he was done speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared with a great multitude, armed with swords and clubs, and sent by their chief priests and elders of the people.

48. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The man whom I shall kiss in he; secure him.

49. And coming directly to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him.

50. Jesus answered, Friend, for what purpose do you come? Then they advanced, and laying hands on Jesus, seized him.

51. Upon this, one of Jesus' company laying hands upon his sword, drew it; and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.

52. Jesus said to him, Sheathe your sword; for whoever has recourse to the sword, shall fall by the sword.

53. Do you think, that I can not presently invoke my Father, who would send to my relief more than twelve legions of angels?

54. But in that case how should the scriptures be accomplished, which declare that these things must be?

55. Then turning to, the multitude, he said, Do you come with swords and clubs to apprehend me, like people in pursuit of a robber? I sat daily amongst you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.

56. But all this has happened, that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.

57. Now thy who had apprehended Jesus, brought him to Caiaphas the high priest, with whom the scribes and the elders were assembled.

58. But Peter followed him at a distance, to the court of the high priest's house, and having gone in, sat with the officers to see the issue.

59. Meantime the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought out false evidence against Jesus, upon which they might condemn him to die.

60. But though many false witnesses appeared, they found it not. At length two false witnesses came,

61. who charged him with saying, I can demolish the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.

62. Then the high priest rising, said to him, Do you answer nothing to what these men testify against you?

63. Jesus remaining silent, he added, On the part of the living God, I adjure you to tell us, whether you be the Messiah, the Son of God?

64. Jesus answered him, It is as you say: nay, be assured, that hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of heaven.

65. Then the high priest, rending his clothes, said, He has uttered blasphemy. What further need have we of witnesses, now that you have heard him blaspheme?

66. What think you? They answered, He deserves to die.

67. Then they spit in his face. Some gave him blows on the head, and others struck him on the cheeks,

68. and said, Divine to us, Messiah, who it was the smote you.

69. Now Peter was sitting without in the court, and a maid servant came to him, and said, You also were with Jesus, the Galilean.

70. But he denied before them all, saying, I know nothing of the matter.

71. And as he went out into the porch, another maid observing him, said to them, This man too was there with Jesus the Nazarene.

72. Again he denied, swearing that he knew him not.

73. Soon after some of the bystanders said to Peter, You are certainly one of them, for your speech discovers you.

74. Upon which, with execrations and oaths, he asserted that he did not know him; and immediately the cock crew.

75. Then Peter remembered the word, which Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow, you will thrice disown me. And he went out an wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. When it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people have consulted against Jesus, how they might procure his death,

2. conducted him bound to Pontius Pilate, the procurator, to whom they delivered him up.

3. Then Judas, who had betrayed him, finding that he was condemned, repented; and returning the thirty shekels to the chief priests and the elders,

4. said, I have sinner, in that I have betrayed the innocent. They answered, What is that to us? See you to that.

5. After which, having thrown down the money in the temple, he went away, and strangled himself.

6. The chief priests taking the money, said, It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.

7. But, after deliberating, they bought with it the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers,

8. for which reason that field is, to this day, called, The Field of Blood.

9. «Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,» 'The thirty shekels, the price at which he was valued, I took, as the Lord appointed me, from the sons of Israel,'

10. who gave them for the potter's field.

11. Now Jesus appeared before the procurator, who questioned him, saying, You are the King of the Jews? He answered, You say right.

12. But when he was arraigned by the chief priests and the elders, he made no reply.

13. Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear of how many crimes they accuse you?

14. But he answered not one word, which surprised the procurator exceedingly.

15. Now the procurator was accustomed to release, at the festival, any one of the prisoners whom the multitude demanded.

16. And they had then a famous prisoners named Barabbas.

17. Therefore. when they were assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom shall I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Messiah?

18. (For he perceived that through envy they had delivered him up;

19. besides, while he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent him this message, Have nothing to do with this innocent person; for today, I have suffered much in a dream, on his account.)

20. But the chief priests and elders instigated the populace to demand Barabbas, and cause Jesus to be executed.

21. Therefore, when the procurator asked, which of the two he should release, they all answered, Barabbas.

22. Pilate replied, What then shall I do with Jesus, whom they call Messiah? They all answered, Let him be crucified.

23. The procurator said, Why? What evil has he done? But they cried the louder, saying, Let him be crucified.

24. Pilate perceiving that he was so far from prevailing, that they grew more tumultuous, took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this innocent person. See you to it.

25. And all the people answering, said, His blood be upon us, and upon your children.

26. Then he released Barabbas to them, and having caused Jesus to be scourged, delivered him up to be crucified.

27. After this, the procurator's soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium, where they gathered around him all the band.

28. And having stripped him, they robed him in a scarlet cloak,

29. and crowned him with a wreath of thorns, and put a rod in his right hand, and kneeling before him in mockery. cried, Hail, King of the Jews!

30. And spitting upon him, they took the rod and struck him with it on the head.

31. When they had mocked him, they disrobed him again, and having put his own raiment on him, led him away to crucify him.

32. As they went out of the city, they met one Simon, a Cyrenian, whom they constrained to carry the cross;

33. and being arrived at a place called Golgotha, which signifies a Place of Skulls,

34. they gave him to drink, vinegar mixed with wormwood, which, having tasted, he would not drink.

35. After they had nailed him to the cross, they parted his garments by lot.

36. And having sat down there, they guarded him.

37. And over his head they placed this inscription, denoting the cause of his death: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. Two robbers also were crucified with him, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.

39. Meanwhile the passengers reviled him, shaking their heads,

40. and saying, You who could demolish the temple, and rebuild it in three days; if you be God's Son, come down from the cross.

41. The chief priests also, with the scribes and elders, deriding him, said,

42. He saved others: can he not save himself? If he be King of Israel, let him now descend from the cross, and we will believe him.

43. He trusted in God. Let God deliver him now, if he regard him; for he called himself God's Son.

44. The robbers too, his fellow-sufferers, upbraided him in the same manner.

45. Now from the sixth hour to the ninth, the whole land was in darkness.

46. About the ninth hour, Jesus cried aloud, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

47. Some of the bystanders hearing this, said, He calls Elijah.

48. Instantly one of them ran, brought a sponge, and soaked it in vinegar, and having fastened it to a stick, presented it to him to drink.

49. The rest said, Forbear, we shall see whether Elijah will come to save him.

50. Jesus having again cried with a loud voice, resigned his spirit.

51. And, behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom, the earth trembled, and the rocks split.

52. Graves also burst open; and after his resurrection, the bodies of several saints who slept were raised,

53. came out of the graves, went into the holy city, and were seen by many.

54. Now the centurion, and they who, with him, guarded Jesus, observing the earthquake, and what passed, were exceedingly terrified, and said, This was certainly the son of a god.

55. Several women also were there, looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, assisting him with their service.

56. Among them were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

57. In the evening a rich Arimathean named Joseph, who was himself a disciple of Jesus,

58. went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Pilate having given orders to deliver it to Joseph,

59. he took the body, wrapped it in clean linen,

60. and deposited it in his own tomb, which he had newly caused to be hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the entrance, he went away.

61. Now Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary were there, sitting over against the sepulcher.

62. On the morrow, being the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees repaired in a body to Pilate,

63. and said, My lord, we remember that this impostor, when alive, said, Within three days I shall be raised.

64. Command, therefore, that the sepulcher be guarded till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him, and say to the people, He is raised from the dead; for this last imposture would prove worse than the first.

65. Pilate answered, You have a guard; make the sepulcher as secure as you can.

66. Accordingly they went and secured it, sealing the stone, and posting guards.

## Matthew 28

1. Sabbath being over, and the first day of the week beginning to dawn, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary, went to visit the sepulcher.

2. Now there had been a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord had descended from heaven, who, having rolled the stone from the entrance, sat upon it.

3. His countenance was like lightning, and his apparel white as snow.

4. Seeing him, the guards quaked with terror, and became as dead men.

5. But the angel said to the women, Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.

6. He is not here; for he is risen, as he foretold. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

7. And go quickly, say to his disciples, He is risen from the dead; behold he goes before you to Galilee, where you shall see him. Take notice: I have told you.

8. Instantly they went from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to inform his disciples.

9. When they were gone, Jesus himself met them, saying, Rejoice. Upon which they prostrated themselves before him, and embraced his feet.

10. Then Jesus said to them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren to repair to Galilee, and there they shall see me.

11. They were no sooner gone, than some of the guard went into the city, and informed the chief priests of all that had happened.

12. These, after meeting and consulting with the elders, gave a large sum to the soldiers,

13. with this injunction: Say, his disciples came by night, and stole him while we were asleep.

14. And if this come to the procurator's ears, we will appease him, and indemnify you.

15. So they took the money, and acted agreeably with to their instructions. Accordingly this report is current among the Jews to this day.

16. Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain, whither Jesus had appointed them to repair.

17. When they saw him, they threw themselves prostrate before him; yet some doubted.

18. Jesus came near, and said to them, All authority is given to me in heaven and upon the earth;

19. go, convert all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;

20. teaching them to observe all the things which I have commanded you: and behold, I am with you always, even to the conclusion of this state.
