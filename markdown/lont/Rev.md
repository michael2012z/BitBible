# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. A revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants the things which must shortly be; and sending by his messenger, he signified them to his servant John,

2. who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatever he saw.

3. Happy is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it; for the time is at hand.

4. John, to the seven congregation which are in Asia; favor and peace be with you, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne;

5. and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth; to him who has loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

6. and has made us kings and priests to his God and Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

7. Behold, he is coming in the clouds; and every eye shall see him, even they who pierced him: and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of him. Yes: so let it be.

8. I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.

9. I, John, who am also your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard a great voice behind me, as of a trumpet,

11. saying, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven congregations; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice which spoke to me, and being turned, I saw seven golden lamps;

13. and, in the midst of the seven lamps, one like a Son of Man, clothed in a long robe, and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle.

14. His head, even his hairs, were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

15. and his feet like fine brass, when glowing in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters;

16. and he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth there went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as the sun, when he shines in his strength.

17. And when I saw him, I fell down at his feet, as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, and said, Fear not; I am the First and the Last;

18. I am he who lives and was dead; and behold, I am living for ever and ever; and I have the keys of the unseen world, and of death.

19. Write the things which you see, even those which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.

20. As to the hidden meaning of the seven stars, which you see in my right hand, and of the seven lamps of gold: the seven stars are messengers of the seven congregations; and the seven lamps which you see, are seven congregations.

## Revelation 2

1. By the messenger of the congregation in Ephesus, write: These things, says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps:

2. I know your works, and your labor, and your patience; and that you can not bear those who are evil: and you have tried those who say they are Apostles, and are not, and have found them liars;

3. and you have patience; and have borne for my name's sake, and have not fainted.

4. Nevertheless, I have against you that you have lost your first love.

5. Remember, therefore, from what you are fallen, and reform, and do the first works, otherwise I will come to you quickly, and take away your lamp out of its place, unless you reform.

6. Yet you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. To him who conquers, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

8. And by the messenger of the congregation in Smyrna, write: These things, says the First and the Last, who was dead, and is alive:

9. I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich,) and I know the slander of those who say they are Jews, and are not; but are the assembly of Satan.

10. Fear none of the things which you shall suffer; behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful until death, and I will give you a crown of life.

11. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. The conqueror shall not be injured by the second death.

12. And by the messenger of the congregation which is in Pergamos, write: These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:

13. I know your works, and where you dwell; even where the throne of Satan is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.

14. Nevertheless, I have a few things against you, that you have there, them who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.

15. You, in like manner, have those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.

16. Reform, or otherwise, I will come to you quickly, and I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

17. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations: To the conqueror I will give of the hidden manna; and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives it.

18. And by the messenger of the congregation in Thyatira, write: These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass:

19. I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and your patience, and that your last works are more than the first.

20. Nevertheless, I have against you, that you permit that woman Jezebel, who says that she is a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.

21. And I have given her time to reform from her fornication, and she reforms not.

22. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they reform from their works;

23. and I will say her children with death; and all the congregations shall know that I am he who search the reins and the heart; and I will give to every one of you according to your works.

24. But I say to you, even to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not hold this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will lay upon you no other burden.

25. Nevertheless, what you have, hold fast till I come.

26. And as for him that conquers, and keeps my works to the end, I will give him power over the nations:

27. and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, they shall be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel: as I have also received of my Father.

28. And I will give him the morning star.

29. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

## Revelation 3

1. And by the messenger of the congregation in Sardis, write: These things says he who has the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you live, but are dead.

2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, which are ready to die: for I have not found your works filled up in the sight of God.

3. Remember, therefore, how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and reform: therefore, unless you are watchful, I will come upon you as thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come upon you.

4. But you have a few names in Sardis, who have not polluted their garments: and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

5. As for the conqueror, he shall be clothed in white apparel; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

6. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

7. And by the messenger of the congregation in Philadelphia, write: These things says the Holy One, the True One; who has the key, the Son of David; he who opens and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens:

8. I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it; because you have little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.

9. Behold, I will give of those-who are of the assembly of Satan; who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold-I will make them to come and worship before your feet; and they shall know that I have loved you.

10. Because you have kept the word of my patience, I will also keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try the inhabitants of the earth.

11. I come quickly: keep that which you have, that no man take your crown.

12. As for the conqueror, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will inscribe upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is to come down from heaven, from my God; and my new name.

13. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

14. And by the messenger of the congregation in Laodicea, write: These things says the AMEN, the Faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:

15. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I wish you were either cold or hot.

16. Therefore, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth.

17. Because you say, I am wealthy, and have enriched myself, and have need of nothing; and do not know that you are wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

18. I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white apparel, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye-salve, that you may see.

19. As many as I love, I reprove and correct; therefore, be zealous, and reform.

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will enter into his house, and will sup with him, and he with me.

21. As for the conqueror, I will give him to sit down with me upon my throne; as I also have conquered, and sat down with my Father upon his throne.

22. Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

## Revelation 4

1. After these things, I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as of a trumpet speaking to me; and it said, Come up hither, and I will show you what shall be hereafter.

2. And immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting upon it;

3. and he who sat on it, was in appearance like a jasper and sardine stone; and a rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, was round about the throne.

4. And round about the throne there were twenty-four thrones; and on the thrones, twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white apparel; and upon their heads golden crowns.

5. And out of the throne there came lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the middle of the throne, in the circle about the throne, there were four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind.

7. And the first creature was like a lion; and the second creature was like a calf; and the third creature had a face like a man; and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.

8. And the four living creatures had, each of them, six wings round about; and within they were full of eyes: and they rest not, day or night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who wast, and art, and art to come.

9. And while the living creatures are giving glory, and honor, and thanks to him who sits upon the throne, who lives for ever and ever,

10. the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits upon the throne, who lives for ever and ever; and they cast down their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a scroll written within and without, sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a mighty messenger proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose its seals?

3. And one in heaven, nor upon the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the scroll, or to look into it.

4. And I wept abundantly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll, nor to look into it.

5. And one of the elders said to me, Weep not; behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and its seven seals.

6. And I beheld, in the middle space, between the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, there stood a Lamb, which seemed to have been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes; these are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.

7. And he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of him who sat upon the throne.

8. And when he received the scroll, the four living creatures, and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one harps, and golden vials full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sung a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the scroll, and to open the seals of it; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation;

10. and hast made us, to our God, kings and priests: and we shall reign on earth.

11. And I beheld, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and of the living creatures, and of the elders: and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;

12. saying, with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing!

13. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, even all things that are in them, I heard saying, To him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb be blessing, and honor, and glory, and strength, for ever and ever!

14. And the four living creatures said, Amen: and the elders fell down and worshiped him.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw, when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures, which said, as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.

2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat upon it, had a bow, and there was given him a crown; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

3. And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature, saying, Come-

4. And another horse came out, which was red; and it was given to him who sat upon it, to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay each other; and there was given to him a great sword.

5. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature, saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat upon it, has a pair of scales in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A chenix of wheat for a denarius, and three chenices of barley for a denarius; you see that you injure not the oil, nor the wine.

7. And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature, saying, Come and see.

8. And I saw, and behold, a pale horse; and as for him who sat on it, his name was Death; and Hades followed him: and there was given to him power to slay the fourth part of the earth with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the field.

9. And when he opened the fifth sea, I saw, under the altar, the souls of those who were slaughtered on account of the word of God, and the testimony which they held.

10. And they cried with a loud voice, and said, How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, before thou dost judge, and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?

11. And there were given to each of them white robes; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet a while, till the number of their fellow-servants and brethren who should be killed, as they had been, should be completed.

12. And I saw, when he opened the sixth seal, and there was an earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair; and the moon became as blood;

13. and the stars fell from heaven, on the earth, as fig tree drops its untimely figs, being shaken by a mighty wind:

14. and the heavens passed away like a scroll, when it is rolled up; and every mountain, and island, was moved out of its place:

15. and the kings of the earth, and the grandees, and the rich men, and the chief officers, and the powerful men, and every slave, and every freeman, hid themselves in the caves, and rocks of the mountains:

16. and they said to the mountains, and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb!

17. for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And, after these things, I saw four angels, standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind might not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor on any tree.

2. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom power was given to injure the earth, and the sea;

3. saying, Injure not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God, in their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of those that were sealed: one hundred and forty-four thousand, who were sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel.

5. Of the tribe of Judah, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad, were sealed twelve thousand.

6. Of the tribe of Asher, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh, were sealed twelve thousand.

7. Of the tribe of Simeon, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar, were sealed twelve thousand.

8. Of the tribe of Zebulon, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph, were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin, were sealed twelve thousand.

9. After this, I saw, and beheld a great multitude, which no one could number, out of every nation, and tribe, and people, and language, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands;

10. and they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!

11. And all the messengers stood round about the throne, and about the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell down on their faces, before the throne, and worshiped God;

12. saying, Amen: the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honor, and the power, and the strength, be to our God for ever and ever: Amen.

13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, As for those who are clothed with white apparel, who are they, and whence do they come?

14. And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they who have come out of much tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:

15. therefore, they are before the throne of God, and serve him, day and night, in his temple; and he who sits upon the throne, pitches his tabernacle over them.

16. They shall hunger no more, neither shall they thirst any more; nor shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat:

17. for the Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and he shall lead them to fountains of living water; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.

3. And another angel came, and stood before the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he might present it with the prayers of all the saints, upon the golden altar which was before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the perfumes went up, with the prayers of the saints, from the hand of the angel, before God.

5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it upon the earth; and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.

7. And the first sounded; and there hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast down upon the earth; and a third part of the trees was burnt up, and all the herbage was burnt up.

8. And the second angel sounded; and it was as if a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea;

9. and a third part of the creatures which had life in the sea, died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.

10. And the third angel sounded; and there fell from heaven a great star, blazing like a torch; and fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters:

11. and the name of the star was called Wormwood, and a third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were become bitter.

12. And the fourth angel sounded; and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day was obscured for a third part, and the night also.

13. And I beheld, and heard one of the angels flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell upon the earth, for the remaining sounds of the trumpets of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel sounded; and I saw a Star fall from the heaven to the earth; and there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.

2. And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke ascended from the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace: and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke there came locusts upon the earth; and power was given to them, as scorpions of the earth have power.

4. And it was said to them that they should not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but the men who had not the seal of God in their foreheads.

5. And it was not given to them to kill them, but to torment them five months: and their torment was like that of a scorpion when it stings a man.

6. And in these days men shall seek death, and shall not find it: and they shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them.

7. And the resemblance of the locusts was like horses prepared for war; and on their heads were, as it were, crowns of gold; and their faces were like the faces of men:

8. and they had tresses, like the tresses of women; and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.

9. And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots, and many horses rushing to war.

10. And they had tails like scorpions, and their stings were in their tails; and their power was to hurt men five months.

11. For they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in the Hebrew language, is Abaddon; and in the Greek, he has the name Apollyon.

12. One woe is gone, and behold other two woes, besides it, yet coming.

13. And the sixth angel sounded; and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which was before God,

14. saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound by the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to kill a third part of men.

16. And the number of the horsemen was two myriads of myriads: I heard the number of them.

17. And I saw the horses, and those who sat upon them, thus in their appearance; having breastplates of fire, and hyacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths went fire, and smoke, and brimstone.

18. With these three-by the fire, by the smoke, and by the brimstone-that went out of their mouths, they slew a third part of men.

19. And their powers are in their mouths, and in their tails; and their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure.

20. Yet the remainder of men, who died not by these plagues, did not reform from the works of their hands, that they might not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.

21. And they reformed not from their murders, and their magical incantations; nor from their fornication, nor their thefts.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel descending from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow was about his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.

2. And he had in his hand a little book, open; and he put his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth.

3. And he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.

4. And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken, and write it not.

5. And the angel, whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth, lifted up his hand toward heaven,

6. and swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and those things which are in it; and the sea, and the things which are in it; and the earth, and the things which are in it; that there should be no longer delay.

7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel; when he shall begin to sound, then the secret of God, as he had revealed its glad tidings to his servants the prophets, should be fulfilled.

8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go, take the little book, which is open, out of the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth.

9. And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall embitter your stomach, but in your mouth it shall be as sweet as honey.

10. And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and eat it up; and in my mouth it was sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.

11. And he said to me, You must again prophesy to many people, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

## Revelation 11

1. And there was given to me a reed like a measuring rod, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship at it;

2. and the outer court of the temple throw out, and measure it not; for it shall be given to the Gentiles, and they shall trample upon the holy city forty-two months.

3. And I will give to my two witnesses commission, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive trees, and the two lamps, which stand before the Lord of the earth.

5. And if any one will injure them, fire shall come out of their mouth, and devour their enemies: and if any one will injure them, so must he be put to death.

6. These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain shall be showered down in the days of their prophecy; they have power over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth as often as they will, with every plague.

7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the savage beast which ascends out of the abyss, shall make war against them, and shall conquer them, and kill them.

8. And their corpses shall lie in the street of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt; where also our Lord was crucified.

9. And persons of various people, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall look on their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not permit their corpses to be laid in the graves.

10. And they who dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and be glad, and shall send gifts to each other; because these two prophets tormented those who dwelt upon the earth.

11. And after three days and a half, the breath of life from God, entered into them, and they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell on those who looked upon them.

12. And they heard a great voice saying to them, from heaven, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies looked on them.

13. And in that hour there was a great earthquake; and a tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand titles of men were destroyed by the earthquake; and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14. The second woe is past, and behold the third woe comes quickly.

15. And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

16. And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshiped God,

17. saying, We give thanks to thee, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and who wast, because thou hast taken by great power, and hast commenced thy reign.

18. And the nations were wroth; and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead when they should be judged, and a reward should be given to thy servants, the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, small and great; and when thou shouldst destroy those that destroy the earth.

19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenants appeared in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.

## Revelation 12

1. And there appeared a great sign in heaven-a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;

2. and she being pregnant, cried out in travail, and in pangs, to be delivered.

3. And there appeared another sign in heaven; and, behold! a great fiery dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven crowns.

4. And his tail drew down a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she was delivered he might devour her child.

5. And she brought forth a masculine son, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and he child was suddenly taken up to God, even to his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that she might there be nourished one thousand two hundred and sixty days.

7. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels made war against the dragon; and the dragon made war, and his angels:

8. nevertheless, they did not prevail, neither was place found for them any more in heaven.

9. And thus the great dragon was cast out; even the old serpent called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the world, was cast out to the earth; and his angels were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a great voice saying, in heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; because the accuser of our brethren is cast out, who accused them before our God day and night.

11. And they have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.

12. Therefore, rejoice you heavens, and you who inhabit them. But woe to those who inhabit the earth and the sea; for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast out on the earth, he persecuted the woman who had brought forth the masculine child.

14. And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place; where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent threw out of his mouth water, like a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream:

16. and the earth opened its mouth, and drank up the flood which the dragon threw out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was enraged against the woman, and went away to make war against the remainder of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and retain the testimony of Jesus Christ.

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a savage beast ascending out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns; and upon its horns were ten diadems; and on its heads were the named of defamation.

2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave it his power, and his throne, and great authority.

3. And I saw one of its heads wounded, as it were, to death; and yet its mortal wound was healed. And the whole earth wondered, and followed after the wild beast;

4. and they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the wild beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who can war against it?

5. And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and defamation: and there was given to it power to practice forty-two months-

6. and it opened its mouth to utter defamation against God; to defame his name and his tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven.

7. And it was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to it power over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.

8. And all the inhabitants of the earth shall worship it, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb, that was slain from the beginning of the world.

9. If any one has an ear, let him hear.

10. If any one lead them into captivity, he shall be led into captivity: if any one slay with the sword, he shall himself be slain with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11. And I saw another beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb: but it spoke like a dragon.

12. And it exercises all the power of the first beast, in its presence; and it makes the earth, and those that dwell in it, to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13. And it does great miracles, so as to make fire come down from heaven to earth, before men;

14. and it deceives the inhabitants of the earth by signs which it is given it to do before the beast; commanding the inhabitants of the earth to make an image of the beast that had the wound of the sword, and lived.

15. And it was given to it to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast might speak, and cause as many as will not worship the image of the beast to be put to death.

16. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, freemen and slaves, to receive the mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads;

17. and that no one should be able to buy or sell, but one who has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.

18. Here is wisdom: let him who has understanding, compute the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and its number is six hundred and sixty-six.

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and behold the Lamb was standing upon Mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand who had the name of his Father written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the sound of many waters, and like the sound of great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers playing upon their harps.

3. And they sang a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and none could learn the song, unless the one hundred and forty-four thousand who are redeemed from the earth.

4. These are they who have not been polluted with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, as the first fruits to God, and to the Lamb.

5. And no deceit was found in their mouth; for they are blameless.

6. And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having everlasting good news to proclaim to the inhabitants of the earth, even to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people;

7. saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgments is come: and worship him who made heaven, and earth, and sea, and the fountains of water.

8. And another angel followed, saying, It is fallen! it is fallen! even Babylon the Great; because it made all the nations drink of the wine of its raging fornication.

9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the beast, and his image, and receive the mark on his forehead, or on his hand,

10. he also shall drink of the wine of the indignation of God, which is tempered, without mixture, in the cup of his wrath; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment ascends for ever and ever: and they have no rest, day nor night, who worship the beast, and his image; and whoever receives the mark of his name.

12. Here is the patience of the saints: here are those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write: Henceforth blessed are the dead that die in the Lord; yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works follow them!

14. And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud, one sitting like a Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

15. And another angel came out of the temple of God, crying with a loud voice, to him that sat upon the cloud. Put forth your sickle, and reap; for the season of reaping is come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.

16. And he that sat upon the cloud put forth his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple that was in heaven; and he had a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel came from the altar, having power over the fire; and he cried out with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Put forth your sharp sickle, and lop off the clusters of the vine upon the earth; for its grapes are ripe.

19. And the angel laid his sickle to the earth, and lopped off the vine of the earth; and he threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.

20. And the wine press, which stood out of the city, was trodden, and the blood came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, at the distance of one thousand six hundred furlongs.

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another great and wonderful sign in heaven; seven angels, who had the seven last plagues; because in them the wrath of God was to be completed.

2. And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those who overcame the beast, and its image, and its mark, and the number of its name; standing by the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

3. And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb; saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, O King of Saints.

4. Who should not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou alone art perfect. Surely all nations shall come and worship before thee, because thy righteous judgments are made manifest.

5. And after this I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in heaven;

6. and the seven angels who had the seven plagues, came out of the temple, clothed with pure shining linen garments; and were girded round the breasts with golden girdles.

7. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels, seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.

8. And the temple was full of smoke from the glory of God, and from his power. And no one could enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying, to the seven angels, Go, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

2. And the first went forth, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there was a malignant and grievous ulcer upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and upon them who worshiped his image.

3. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became blood, like that of a dead man: and every living soul that was in the sea died.

4. And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers, and on the fountains of water; and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art, and who wast; who art perfect; because thou hast judged these:

6. for they have poured forth the blood of saints, and prophets; and thou hast given them blood to drink-they are worthy.

7. And I heard a voice from the altar, saying, Yes, O Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

8. And the fourth angel poured forth his vial on the sun; and power was given to it to scorch men with fire.

9. And men were scorched with great heat, and they reviled the name of God, who had power over these plagues, and reformed not, to give him glory.

10. And the fifth poured forth his vial upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened, and they gnawed their tongues for

11. anguish, and reviled the God of heaven for their pains and their ulcers, and reformed not from their works.

12. And the sixth poured forth his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.

13. And I saw, and out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet there came forth three unclean spirits, like frogs:

14. for these are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

15. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watches, and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked, so that they should see his shame.

16. And he gathered them together into a place which is called, in the Hebrew language, Armageddon.

17. And the seven poured forth his vial into the air; and there came forth a great voice from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.

18. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been from the time that men were upon the earth; such and so great an earthquake.

19. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the Gentiles fell down. And Babylon the great came into remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of his fiercest wrath.

20. And every island fled away, and the mountains were found no more.

21. And a great hail, as of the weight of a talent, descended from heaven upon men: and men reviled God, because of the plague of the hail; for the plague of it was very great.

## Revelation 17

1. And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials, came and spoke with me, saying, Come, and I will show you the judgment of the great harlot, that sits upon many waters:

2. with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and all the inhabitants of the earth have been drunk with the wine of her whoredom.

3. And he brought me, in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of slanderous names, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was clothed with purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls; having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abominations and pollution of her whoredom.

5. And she had upon her forehead her name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.

7. And the angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will tell you the secret of the woman, and of the beast which carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.

8. The beast which you saw, was, and is not; and he will ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go to destruction; and the inhabitants of the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life, from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast who was, and is not, yet shall be.

9. Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.

10. And they are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must endure for a little time.

11. And the beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth, and is of the seven, but goes to destruction.

12. And the ten horns which you saw, are ten kings, which have not yet received their kingdom, but they shall receive authority with the beast, as kings at the same time.

13. These have one mind, and shall deliver their own power and authority to the beast.

14. These shall make war with the Lamb; and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings; and those that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful.

15. And he said to me, The waters which you saw, on which the harlot sat, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and make her desolate and naked; and they shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire.

17. For God has given it into the hearts to execute his sentence, even to perform one purpose; and to give their kingdoms to the beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.

18. And the woman which you saw, is the great city, that rules over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. And after this, I saw an angel descending from heaven, who had great power; and the earth was enlightened with his glory.

2. And he cried with a mighty and a loud voice, saying, It is fallen! it is fallen! it is fallen! even Babylon the Great: and it is become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird:

3. for she has caused all the nations to drink of the wine of her raging whoredom; and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, and the merchants of the earth have been enriched by the abundance of her luxuries.

4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, that you may not be partakers with her in her sins, and that you may not partake of her plagues:

5. for her sins have followed up to heaven, and her unrighteous actions are come up in remembrance before God.

6. Give her, as he also has given; and recompense to her double, according to her works: in the cup which she has mingled, mingle to her double.

7. In proportion to the degree in which she has made ostentation of her glory, and lived in luxury, inflict upon her torment and grief. Because she has said in her heart, I sit as a queen, and am not a widow, and shall not see sorrow;

8. therefore, in one day shall her plagues come-death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judges her.

9. And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication, and lived in luxury with her, shall mourn and lament, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

10. standing afar off, for fear of her torment, saying, Alas! alas! the great city, Babylon; the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.

11. And the merchants of the earth shall wail and lament over her, because no one buys their wares any longer-

12. the merchandise of gold, and silver, and jewels, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and every odiferous wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble,

13. and cinnamon, and perfume, and myrrh, and incense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and oxen, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

14. And the fruits which thy soul desired, are gone from thee; and all delicious and splendid things are departed from thee, and thou shalt never find them any more.

15. The merchants of these commodities, who were enriched by her, shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping, and mourning,

16. and saying, Alas! alas! the great city, that was clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls;

17. for in one hour all these riches are laid waste. And every pilot, and every passenger, and the mariners, and all that bestow their labor upon the sea, stood afar off,

18. and cried, when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to the great city!

19. And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping, and mourning, saying, Alas! alas! the great city, by whose magnificent expenses, all that had ships in the sea were enriched; for she is made desolate in one hour!

20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and you saints, and apostles, and prophets; for on your account God has pronounced sentence upon her.

21. And a strong angel took a stone, like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea; saying, Thus shall Babylon, the great city, he dashed down with violence, and never be found again.

22. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, of them that play the flute, and sound the trumpet, shall be heard no more in thee; nor shall the noise of the millstone be heard any more in thee;

23. and the light of a lamp shall be seen no more in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom, and of the bride, shall be heard no more in thee: because they merchants were the grandees of the earth-because by thy sorceries were all the nations deceived:

24. and in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, even of all those who were slain upon the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. And after these things, I heard the voice as of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! salvation, and glory, and power, to the Lord our God;

2. for his judgments are true and righteous; for he has judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and he has avenged the blood of his servants shed by her hand.

3. And a second time they said, Hallelujah! And the smoke of her torment ascended for ever and ever.

4. And the twenty-four elders, and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!

5. And a voice came out from the throne, which said, Praise our God, all you his servants, you that fear him, both small and great.

6. And I heard a sound, which was as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and like the peal of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah! for the Lord God, the Omnipotent, reigns!

7. We rejoice, and exult, and give glory to him, because the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has prepared herself.

8. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, pure and resplendent; and the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.

9. And he said to me, Write-Happy are they who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb! And he said to me, These are the true words of God.

10. And I fell before his feet to worship him; and he said to me, See you do it not: I am a fellow-servant with you, and with your brethren who keep the testimony of Jesus. Worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon it was called Faithful and True; and he judges and makes war in righteousness:

12. whose eyes are as a flame of fire; and many diadems were upon his head, having a name written which no man knows but himself:

13. and he was clothed in a garment dipped in blood, and his name is called THE WORD OF GOD.

14. And the armies which are in heaven followed him, riding on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

15. And there went out of his mouth a sharp sword, that with it he might smite the nations: and he shall govern them with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine press of the indignation and wrath of almighty God.

16. And he has upon his garment and his thigh a name written- KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

17. And I saw a single angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds of prey, which were flying in the midst of heaven, Come, and assemble yourselves to the great supper of God:

18. that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of the mighty, and the flesh of horses, and of those that sat on them; and the flesh of all, both freemen and slaves, both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war with him who sits upon the white horse, and with his army.

20. And the beast was taken captive, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image; both of whom were cast alive into the lake of fire which burned with brimstone.

21. And the rest were slain with the sword that came out of the mouth of him who sat on the horse: and all the birds were satiated with their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel descending from heaven, who had the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;

3. and he cast him into the abyss, and shut him down, and set a seal upon him, that he might not deceive the nations any more, till the thousand years were accomplished; and then he must be loosed again for a little time.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them-even the souls of them who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast, nor his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads, and upon their hands; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years:

5. but the rest of the dead revived not till the thousand years were accomplished: this is the first resurrection.

6. Happy and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection! on such, the second death shall have no power; but they shall be the priests of God, and of Christ: and they shall reign with him a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years shall be accomplished, Satan shall be loosed from his confinement;

8. and he shall go forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth. Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war; whose number is like the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God, out of heaven, and devoured them.

10. And the devil, who had deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet were: and they shall be tormented day and night for ages and ages.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them.

12. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every one according to his works.

14. And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.

15. And if any one was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth were passed away: and the sea was no more.

2. And I, John, saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, descending from God, out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall pitch his tent among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be among them-their God.

4. And he shall away wipe every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, nor grief, nor crying; nor shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

5. And he that sat upon the throne, said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said, Write, for these are true and faithful words.

6. And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End: I will give to him that is athirst, of the fountain of the water of life freely.

7. The conqueror shall inherit all things: and I will be to him a God, and he shall be to me my son.

8. But, as for the cowards, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and prostitutes, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars-their part shall be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

9. And there came one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues; and spoke with me, saying, Come, and I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.

10. And he brought me, in the Spirit, to a great and high mountain; and he showed me the city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,

11. having the glory of God; (its luster was like that of a precious gem, even as a jasper stone, clear as crystal,)

12. having a great and high wall; having also twelve gates, and over the gates twelve angels, and names written upon them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:

13. on the east, three gates; on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations; and on them the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he that spoke with me, had a golden reed, that he might measure the city, and its gates and wall.

16. And the city is square, and its length is equal to its breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: and its length and its breadth, and its height are equal.

17. And he measured its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.

18. And the wall was built of jasper, and the city was pure gold, like refined glass.

19. And the foundations of the walls of the city, were adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation is jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

20. the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: each of the gates was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple of it.

23. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of the Lord enlightened it, and the Lamb is the light of it.

24. And the nations of the saved shall walk in its light; and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and their honor into it.

25. And the gates of it shall not be shut by day; (for there shall be no night there.)

26. And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.

27. And nothing unclean shall enter into it, nor anything which practices abomination and falsehood; but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, issuing out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.

2. In the midst of the broad street, and on each side of the river, was the tree of life, producing twelve kinds of fruit- producing its fruit in every month: and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

3. And every curse shall cease. And the throne of God, and of the Lamb, shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.

4. And they shall see his face: and his name shall be borne upon their foreheads.

5. And there shall be no more night; and they have no need of a lamp, nor of the light of the sun; because the Lord God shall enlighten them: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

6. And he said to me, These words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets, has sent his holy angel to show his servants what must quickly be done.

7. Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.

8. And I, John, saw and heard these things, and when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.

9. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am a fellow-servant with you, and of your brethren, the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book: worship God.

10. And he said to me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is near.

11. Let him that is unjust, be unjust still; and let him that is polluted, be polluted still; and let him that is righteous, be righteous still; and let him that is holy, be holy still.

12. Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me: I will recompense to every man according as his works shall be.

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega-the Beginning and the End: the First and the Last.

14. (Happy are they who keep his commandments, that they may have the privilege to eat of the tree of life; and they shall enter by the gates into the city.

15. Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one who loves and invents a lie.)

16. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you, in the congregations. I am the Root and the Offspring of David; the bright and the Morning Star.

17. And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come: and let him that hears, say, Come: and let him that is thirsty, come: whoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.

18. And I testify of every one that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book:

19. and if any one take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city-the things which are written in this book.

20. He who testifies these things, says, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

21. May the favor of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints!
