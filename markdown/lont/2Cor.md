# 2 Corinthians

## 2 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, the brother, to the congregation of God which is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia:

2. Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all consolation!

4. who comforts us in all out affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the consolation with which they are comforted of God.

5. For as the sufferings for Christ abound in us, also, our consolation abounds through Christ.

6. Now, whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort, and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effected by enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.

7. And out hope of you is steadfast, knowing that, as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the comfort.

8. Wherefore, brethren, we would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction, which happened to us in Asia; that we were exceedingly pressed above our strength, insomuch as we despaired even of life.

9. Nay, more, we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;

10. who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;

11. you, also, laboring together in prayer for us, that the gift to us from many persons, may, by many, be acknowledged with thanksgiving for us.

12. For this is our glorying-the testimony of our conscience, that with godly simplicity and sincerity, (not with fleshly wisdom, but by the favor of God,) we have behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly among you.

13. For we write no other things to you than what you read, and also acknowledge; and I hope that you will acknowledge, even to the end;

14. seeing, indeed, you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.

15. And in this persuasions I purposed to come to you first, that you might have a second gift;

16. and from you to pass through into Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come again to you, and by you to be sent forward into Judea.

17. Having, then, purposed this, did I, indeed, use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh; so that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?

18. But as God is faithful, certainly our word, which was to you, was not yes and no.

19. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed to you by us, even by me and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not yes and no; but in him was yes.

20. And whatever promises are of God, were through him yes, and through him amen, to the glory of God, by us.

21. Now, he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who has anointed us, in God:

22. who has also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

23. Moreover, I call on God as a witness against my soul, that to spare you, I have not as yet come to Corinth.

24. Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are joint promoters of your joy: for by the faith you stand.

## 2 Corinthians 2

1. Besides, I determined this with myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.

2. For if I should make you sorry, who then is he that could make me glad, unless the same who is made sorry by me?

3. Wherefore, I wrote to you this very thing, that, coming, I might not have sorrow from them in whom I ought to rejoice; being firmly persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

4. For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears; not that you might be made sorry, but that you might know the love which I have most abundantly toward you.

5. Now, if a certain person has grieved me, he has not grieved me except by a part of you, that I may not lay a load on you all.

6. Sufficient for such a one is the punishment, which was inflicted by the majority.

7. So that, on the other hand, you ought more willingly to forgive and comfort him, lest such a one should be swallowed up by excessive grief.

8. Wherefore, I beseech you to confirm your love to him.

9. For to this end, also, I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.

10. Now, to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive: and even I, if I have now forgiven anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it, in the person of Christ:

11. that we may not be overreached by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.

12. Moreover, when I came to Troas, in order to declare the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord;

13. I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother: therefore, bidding them farewell, I went away into Macedonia.

14. Now, thanks be to God, who at all times causes us to triumph in Christ; and who, by us, diffuses the odor of the knowledge of him in every place:

15. for we are, through God, a fragrant odor of Christ, among the saved and among the destroyed.

16. To these, indeed, we are the odor of death, ending in death; but to the others, the odor of life, ending in life: and who is competent to these things?

17. However, we are not like many who adulterate the word of God: but really from sincerity, yes, really from God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 3

1. Must we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or letters of recommendation from you?

2. You are out letter, written on our hearts, known and read of all men.

3. For you are plainly declared Christ's letter, ministered by us, written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.

4. Now we have such confidence through Christ, toward God;

5. not that we are competent by ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves: but our competency is from God,

6. who has made us competent ministers of a new institution; not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills; but the spirit makes alive.

7. For if the ministration of death in letters engraved on stone was with glory, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished;

8. how much rather shall not the ministration of the Spirit be with glory?

9. For if the ministration of condemnation was glorious, much more does the ministration of justification abound in glory.

10. For, indeed, that which was glorified, was not glorified, in this respect, by reason of the transcendent glory.

11. For if that which is abolished was with glory, much more that which continues, is with glory.

12. Having, therefore, such confidence, we use great plainness of speech;

13. and not as Moses, who put a vail upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.

14. Indeed, their minds were blinded: for, till this day, the same vail remains in the reading of the Old Institution; it not being discovered that it is abolished in Christ.

15. Moreover, till this day, when Moses is read, the vail lies upon their heart.

16. But when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken from around it.

17. Now, the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

18. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord; are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.

## 2 Corinthians 4

1. Wherefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not falter;

2. but have commanded away the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

3. If then, indeed, our gospel be veiled, it is veiled among the destroyed;

4. among whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might shine into them.

5. Now, we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants, for Jesus' sake.

6. For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us.

8. We are pressed on every side, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair;

9. persecuted, but not utterly forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.

10. At all times carrying about in the body, the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.

11. For we who live are always exposed to death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.

12. So that death works in us, but life in you.

13. «Yet, having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written,'I believed, therefore I have spoken'; we, also, believe, and therefore speak;»

14. knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, will raise us up, also, by Jesus, and will present us with you.

15. For all these things are for your sakes; that the favor which has abounded to many, may, through the thanksgiving of the greater number, redound to the glory of God.

16. Wherefore, we do not faint; but, though, indeed, out outward man is impaired, yet the inward man is renewed, day by day.

17. For our momentary light afflictions work out for us an eternal weight of glory, great beyond expression;

18. while we are aiming, not at things seen, but at things unseen: for the things seen are temporal, but the things unseen are eternal.

## 2 Corinthians 5

1. For we know that if the earthy house of this our tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, everlasting, in the heavens.

2. For, indeed, in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be invested with our heavenly mansion.

3. And surely, being thus invested, we shall not be found naked.

4. For, indeed, we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not that we desire to be divested, but invested: that mortality may be swallowed up by life.

5. Now he who has wrought us up to this very desire, is God, who has also given us the earnest of the Spirit.

6. We are, therefore, always courageous; knowing that while at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

7. (for we walk by faith, not by sight.)

8. We are courageous, indeed, and desirous rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

9. Therefore, also, we strive earnestly, whether at home, or from home, to be acceptable to him.

10. For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to what has been done, whether good or evil.

11. Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; and are made manifest to God: and, I trust, are made manifest also to your consciences.

12. However, we do not again commend ourselves to you, but only give you occasion of boasting concerning us, that you may have an answer to them who boast in appearance, not in heart.

13. For, whether we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.

14. For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged thus- that if one has died, certainly all have died;

15. and that he has died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who has died and rose again for them.

16. So that we, from this time forth, respect no man on account of the flesh: and even if we have esteemed Christ on account of the flesh, yet now we esteem him no more on that account.

17. For, if any one be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new!

18. And all these things of God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us to the ministry of the reconciliation-

19. namely, that God was, by Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not counting to them their trespasses, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.

20. We, therefore, execute the office of ambassadors for Christ, as of God beseeching you by us; we pray you, in behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

21. For he has made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us; that we might become the justified of God, by him.

## 2 Corinthians 6

1. We, then, as fellow-laborers, also beseech you not to receive the favor of God in vain;

2. «(for he says,» 'In an accepted season I have hearkened to you; and in a day of salvation I have helped you.' 'Behold, now is a highly accepted season; behold, now is a day of salvation:)'

3. giving no cause of offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed.

4. But by everything approving ourselves as ministers of God, by much patience, by oppressions, by necessities, by distresses,

5. by stripes, by imprisonments, by tumults, by labors, by watchings, by fastings;

6. by purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by goodness, by a holy spirit, by love unfeigned;

7. by the word of truth, by the power of God, through the armor of righteousness of the right hand and of the left;

8. through honor and dishonor, through bad fame and good fame; as deceivers, yet true;

9. as unknown, yet well known; as dying, yet, behold, we live; as chastened, yet not killed;

10. as sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.

11. Corinthians! our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.

12. You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.

13. Now, in return, (I speak as to children,) be you also enlarged.

14. Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?

15. what concord has Christ with Belial? or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?

16. «And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said,» 'Assuredly I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people.'

17. Wherefore, come out from among them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch no unclean person; and I will receive you;

18. «and I be to you a Father, and you shall be to me sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.»

## 2 Corinthians 7

1. Wherefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit; perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

2. Receive us cordially. We have injured no one; we have corrupted no one; we have defrauded no one.

3. I speak not this to condemn you; for I have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die and live with you.

4. Great is my freedom of speech to you; great is my boasting concerning you: I am filled with consolation, I exceedingly abound in joy in all our affliction.

5. For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh has no rest, but we were distressed on every side; without were fightings- within were fears.

6. Nevertheless, God, who comforts them who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus-

7. (not, indeed, by his coming only; but more especially by the consolation with which he was comforted by you) -when he told us your earnest desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.

8. Therefore, though I made you sorry by the letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that that letter, though suitable to the occasion, made you sorry.

9. I now rejoice; not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow produced reformation: for you were made to sorrow in a godly manner, that you might be injured by us in nothing.

10. For godly sorrow produces a reformation to salvation, never to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world produces death.

11. Behold, now, this very thing-your being made sorry with a godly sorrow-what carefulness it wrought in you; yes, what clearing of yourselves; yes, what indignation; yes, what fear; yes, what earnest desire; yes, what zeal; yes, what revenge! Upon the whole, you have showed yourselves to be pure in this matter.

12. And, indeed, though I wrote to you, it was not for his sake who did the wrong, nor for his sake who suffered it; but rather, that our care for you, in the presence of God might be manifested to you.

13. For this reason, we were comforted in your comfort: yes, we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.

14. That if I have boasted anything to him concerning you, I am not ashamed: for, as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so, also, our boasting to Titus is verified.

15. And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, and how you received him with fear and trembling.

16. I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.

## 2 Corinthians 8

1. Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the charity of God, which is given by the congregations of Macedonia;

2. that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their extreme poverty, superabounded to the riches of their liberality:

3. that to their power, (I bear witness,) yes, beyond their power, they were willing of themselves; with much entreaty

4. requesting us to accept the charity and the participation of the service, which is for the saints.

5. Yes, beyond our expectations; for they first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.

6. This moved us to entreat Titus, that as he had formerly begun, so he would also finish the same charity among you likewise.

7. Now as you abound in every gift, (in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us,) I wish that you may abound in this gift also.

8. I speak not this as an injunction, but on account of the diligence of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

9. (For you know the charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor; that you, through his poverty, might be rich.)

10. And in this I give my opinion, not only to do, but also to be willing since the last year.

11. At present, therefore, finish the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will; so also let there be to finish, according to your ability.

12. For if there be a willing mind, according to what a person has, he is accepted; and not according to what he has not.

13. However, I mean not that others should be eased and you distressed; but on account of equality,

14. that now your abundance may be a supply for their want; that again, their abundance may be a supply for your want; that there may be an equality.

15. «As it is written,» 'He who gathered much, had nothing over; and he who gathered little, had no lack.'

16. Now thanks be to God, who has put the same earnest care concerning you, into the heart of Titus.

17. For he, indeed, received an exhortation; but from his great earnestness, was going to you of his own accord.

18. And with him we have sent the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the congregations.

19. And not only so, but who was also chosen by the congregations our fellow-traveler, with this charity, which is ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord himself, and of your readiness:

20. using this precaution, that none may blame us in the distribution of this abundance;

21. premeditating things comely, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in sight of men.

22. And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes found diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, from the great confidence which he has in you.

23. If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow-laborer for you; or if our brethren be inquired of, they are Apostles of congregations, and a glory of Christ.

24. Wherefore, the proof of your love, and of our boasting concerning you, display before them, and before the face of the congregations.

## 2 Corinthians 9

1. But, indeed, concerning the ministry which is for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.

2. For I know your willingness: of which I boasted on your behalf, to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared since the last year; and your zeal has stirred up the multitude.

3. Yet I have sent the brethren, that our boasting concerning you, may not be rendered false in this particular; but that as I said you may be prepared.

4. Lest, perhaps, if the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not you) should be put to shame by this confidence.

5. Therefore, I thought it necessary to entreat the brethren, that they would go before you, and complete beforehand your formerly announced bounty; that the same might be thus ready as a gift, and not as a thing extorted.

6. Now this I say, he who sows sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully, shall reap bountifully.

7. Every one according as he has purposed in his heart, ought to give; not with regret, nor by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver.

8. And God is able to make every blessing abound to you; that in everything, always having all sufficiency, you may abound in every good work.

9. «As it is written,» 'He has dispersed, he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever.'

10. Now, may he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the products of your righteousness.

11. That you may be enriched in everything, for all liberality, which produces, through us, thanksgiving to God.

12. For the ministry of this public service, not only fill us up completely the wants of the saints; but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God.

13. They, through the proof of the ministry, glorifying God for you avowed subjection to the gospel of Christ; and for the liberality of your contribution for them, and for all;

14. and for their prayer for you, who ardently love you, on account of the exceeding favor of God bestowed on you.

15. Now, thanks to God for his unspeakable gift.

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. Now, I (the same Paul who, when present, indeed, am humble among you; but when absent, am bold toward you,)

2. beseech you, by the mildness and clemency of Christ. And I request that, when present I may not be bold with that confidence with which I conclude to be bold against some, who conclude us to be really persons who walk according to the flesh.

3. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh;

4. (for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but exceeding powerful for the overturning of strongholds;)

5. overturning reasonings, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God; and leading captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;

6. and are prepared to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is completed.

7. Do you look on things according to appearance? If any one is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him, on the other hand, reason this from himself, that he is Christ's, so, also, are we.

8. And, therefore, I should not be ashamed, if I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord has given us for your edification, and not for your destruction.

9. That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters;

10. (for his letters, says one, are indeed weighty and strong; but his bodily presence weak, and his speech contemptible;)

11. let such a one conclude this, that such as we are in speech by letters, when absent, the same, also, when present, we will be in deed.

12. But we dare not rank and compare ourselves with some who commend themselves: however, they, among themselves, measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand themselves.

13. Further, we will not boast of things not measured according to the line of measure, which the God of measure has allotted to us, to reach even to you.

14. For we do not stretch ourselves beyond our line, as not reaching to you; (but we are come as far as to you also, in the gospel of Christ.)

15. We do not boast of things not measured, that is, of other men's labors; but we have hope when your faith is increased, to be by you abundantly enlarged with respect to our line;

16. to declare the gospel in the regions beyond you; and not in another man's line, to boast of things already prepared.

17. He, then, who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.

18. For not he who commends himself is approved; but whom the Lord commends.

## 2 Corinthians 11

1. I wish you would bear with me a little in my foolishness: yes, indeed, bear with me:

2. for I am jealous of you with a godly jealousy; because I have espoused you to one husband, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.

3. But I am afraid that, by some means, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.

4. For, if, indeed, he who has come preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached; or, if you receive another Spirit which you have not received; or another gospel which you have not embraced; you might justly bear with him.

5. For I reckon myself to have come nothing short of the very chief of the Apostles.

6. And even though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge. But upon the whole, we have been made manifest to you in all things.

7. Have I committed an offense in humbling myself that you might be exalted; because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?

8. I robbed other congregations, taking wages of them to do you service;

9. for being present with you, and in want, we were burdensome to no one; but what I wanted, the brethren from Macedonia supplied: and in everything I have kept, and will keep myself from being burdensome to you.

10. Is the truth in me? then this my boasting shall not be prevented in the regions of Achaia.

11. For what reason? because I do not love you? God knows.

12. But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off opportunity from them who desire opportunity; that in what they boast, they may be found even as we.

13. For such are false Apostles, deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ.

14. And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.

15. Therefore, it is no great wonder if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness: whose end shall be according to their works.

16. Moreover, I say, let no one think me a fool; but, if otherwise, at least, as a fool, bear with me, that I also may boast a little.

17. What I speak in this confident boasting, I do not speak according to the Lord; but as in foolishness.

18. Seeing many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.

19. For, being wise, you bear with fools cheerfully.

20. For if one enslave you, you bear it; if one devour you, if one take your goods, if one exalt himself, if one strike you on the face-

21. I speak of reproach, as, that we are weak. But, in whatever any one is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

22. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

23. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am above them: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;

24. of the Jews, five times I received forty stripes, save one:

25. thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stone, thrice I was ship-wrecked: I have spent a night and a day in the deep.

26. In journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the heathens, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brethren.

27. In labor and toil; in watching often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness.

28. Besides these troubles from without, that which is my daily pressure, the anxious care of all the congregations.

29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn?

30. If I must boast, I will boast of the things which relate to my weakness.

31. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie.

32. In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas, intending to apprehend me, guarded the city of the Damascenes;

33. but I was let down in a basket, through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.

## 2 Corinthians 12

1. To boast, indeed, is not profitable to me; yet I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord.

2. I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know; God knows:) such a one suddenly conveyed away to the third heaven.

3. Indeed, I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know:)

4. that he was suddenly conveyed away into paradise, and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful for man to utter.

5. Concerning such a one I will boast; but concerning myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.

6. Yet if I should incline to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think concerning me, above what he sees me to be, or what he hears from me.

7. Indeed, that I might not be exalted above measure by the transcendency of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

8. Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.

9. But he said to me, My favor is sufficient for you, besides, my power is perfected in weakness: most gladly, therefore, I will boast rather of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.

10. Wherefore, I am well pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with necessities, with persecutions, with distresses, for Christ's sake; because when I am weak, then I am strong.

11. Have I become a fool-? You have constrained me to it; for I ought to have been commended by you, because I am in nothing behind the very greatest Apostles, though I am nothing.

12. Truly the signs of an Apostle were fully wrought among you with all patience, by signs and wonders, and powers.

13. For what is the thing in which you were inferior to other congregations, unless that I myself have not been burdensome to you? Forgive me this injury.

14. Behold, a third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you; because I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

15. Yes, I most gladly will spend and be spent for the sake of your souls; even though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.

16. Be it so, then, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile!

17. With respect to any one of them I sent to you, did I by him make gain of you?

18. I besought Titus to go to you; and with him I sent a brother: did Titus make any gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?

19. Again, do you think that we apologize to you? In the presence of God we speak in Christ, that all these things, beloved, are done for your edification.

20. Yet I am afraid, lest, perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish: and that I shall be found by you, such as you do not wish: -lest, perhaps, there be among you strifes, emulations, wraths, brawlings, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults.

21. And lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you; and I shall bewail many, who have formerly sinned, and have not reformed from the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. I am coming this third time to you: by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every matter shall be established.

2. I have told you before, and now forewarn the second time, (as if present, though still absent,) those who have formerly sinned, and all others, that when I come again I will not spare;

3. since you seek a proof of Christ speaking by me: (who is not weak toward you, but who is mighty among you;

4. for though we was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God; and though we also are weak with him, yet we shall live with him, by the power of God toward you.)

5. Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove yourselves: know you not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?

6. But I trust that you shall know that we are not disapproved.

7. However, I pray to God that you do no evil-not that we may appear approved; but that you may do what is good, though, indeed, we should be disapproved.

8. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

9. Therefore we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong: and this, also, we pray for, even your perfection.

10. For this reason, being absent, I write these things, that, when present, I may not act sharply, according to the power which the Lord has give me for edification, and not for destruction.

11. Finally, brethren, farewell: be perfect: comfort yourselves: mind the same thing: live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.

12. Salute one another with a holy kiss.

13. All the saints salute you.

14. The favor of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
