# 2 John

## 2 John 1

1. The elder, to Electa Cyria, and her children, whom I love sincerely; and not I only, but also all who have known the truth;

2. for the truth's sake, which is in us, and shall be with us forever:

3. Favor, mercy, and peace, be with you, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love.

4. I rejoiced greatly, when I found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.

5. And now I beseech you, Cyria, not as writing to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

6. And this is the love that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you have heard from the beginning, that you may walk in it;

7. for many deceivers are entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ did come in the flesh. This is the deceiver, and the antichrist.

8. Look to yourselves, that we may not lose the things which we have wrought, but may receive a full reward.

9. Whoever transgresses, and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ, has not God: he who abides in the doctrine of Christ, has both the Father and the Son.

10. If any one come to you, and bring not this doctrine; receive him not into your house, nor wish him success:

11. for he who wishes him success, partakes in his evil deeds.

12. Having many things to write to you, I did not incline to communicate them by paper and ink; because I hope to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be complete.

13. The children of your beloved sister, salute you.
