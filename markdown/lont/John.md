## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. This was in the beginning with God.

3. All things were made by him, and without him not a single creature was made.

4. In him was life, and the life was the light of man.

5. And the light shone in darkness, but the darkness received it not.

6. A man named John, was sent from God.

7. This man came as a witness, to testify concerning the light, that through him, all might believe.

8. He was not himself the light; but came to testify concerning the light.

9. The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightens every man.

10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.

11. He came to his own land, and his own people did not receive him;

12. but to as many as received him, believing in his name, he granted the privilege of being children of God;

13. who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.

14. And the Word became incarnate, and sojourned amongst us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of favor and truth.

15. (It was concerning him John testified, when he cried, This is He of whom I said, He that comes after me, is preferred to me; for he was before me.)

16. Of his fulness we all have received, even favor for favor's sake;

17. for the law was given by Moses-the favor and the truth came by Jesus Christ.

18. No one ever saw God; it is the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, who has made him known.

19. Now this is the testimony of John. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who are you?

20. he acknowledged, and denied not, but acknowledged, saying, I am not the Messiah.

21. And they asked him, Who, then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet? He answered, No.

22. They said, Tell, then, who you are, that we may return an answer to them who sent us. What do you say of yourself?

23. «He answered, I am he whose voice proclaims in the wilderness,» 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' 'as said, the Prophet Isaiah.'

24. Now they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.

25. And they questioned him further, Why, then, do you immerse, if you be not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?

26. John answered, I immerse in water, but there is one among you whom you know not.

27. It is he who comes after me, and was before me; whose shoe-string I am not worthy to loose.

28. This happened at Bethabara, upon the Jordan, where John was immersing.

29. On the next day, John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.

30. This is He, concerning whom I said, After me a man comes, who is preferred to me; for he was before me.

31. As for me, I knew him not; but, that he might be made manifest to Israel, I am come immersing in water.

32. John testified further, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven, like a dove, and remaining upon him.

33. For my part, I should not have known him, had not He, who sent me to immerse in water, told me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining, the same is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.

34. Having, therefore, seen this, I testify that he is the Son of God.

35. The next day, John, being with two of his disciples,

36. observed Jesus passing, and said, Behold the Lamb of God.

37. The two disciples hearing this, followed Jesus.

38. And Jesus turning about, saw them following, and said to them, What do you seek? They answered, Rabbi, (which signifies Teacher,) where do you dwell?

39. He replied, Come, and see. They went, and saw where he dwelt, and it being about the tenth hour, abode with him that day.

40. One of the two, who, having heard John, followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.

41. The first he met, was his own brother, Simon; to whom he said, We have found the Messiah, (a name equivalent to Christ.)

42. And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus, looking upon him, said, You are Simon, the son of Jona; you shall be called Cephas, (which denotes the same as Peter.)

43. The next day, he resolved to go to Galilee, and meeting Philip, said to him, Follow me.

44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip meets Nathanael, and says to him, We have found the person described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, of Nazareth.

46. Nathanael says to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip answered, Come and see.

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, concerning him, Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile.

48. Nathanael said to him, Whence do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip called you.

49. Nathanael replying, said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.

50. Jesus answered him, saying, Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe!

51. He added, Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to him.

## John 2

1. Three days after, there was a marriage in Cana, of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.

2. Jesus, also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.

3. The wine falling short, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.

4. Jesus answered, Woman, what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come.

5. His mother said to the servants, Do whatever he shall bid you.

6. Now there were six water pots of stone, containing two or three baths each, placed there for the Jewish rites of cleansing.

7. Jesus said to them, Fill the pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.

8. Then he said, Draw, now, and carry to the director of the feast. And they did so.

9. When the director of the feast had tasted the wine made of water, not knowing whence it was, (but the servants who drew the water knew,)

10. he said, addressing the bridegroom, Every person presents the best wine first, and worse wine afterward, when the guests have drunk largely; but you have reserved the best till now.

11. This first miracle Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, displaying his glory: and his disciples believed on him.

12. Afterward, he went to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; but they staid not there many days.

13. And the Jewish passover being nigh, Jesus went to Jerusalem;

14. and finding changers sitting in the temple, and people who sold cattle and sheep, and doves;

15. he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and cattle, scattering the coin of the changers, and oversetting their tables.

16. and he said to them, who sold doves, Take these things hence. Make not my Father's house a house of traffic.

17. «(Then his disciples remembered these words of the scripture,'My zeal for thy house consumes me.')»

18. Therefore, the Jews answered, and said to him, By what miracle do you show us your title to do these things?

19. Jesus answering, said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will rear it again in three days.

20. The Jews replied, Forty and six years was this temple in building; and you would rear it in three days?

21. (But, by the temple, he meant his body.)

22. When, therefore, he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they understood the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.

23. While he was at Jerusalem, during the feast of the passover, many believed on him, when they saw the miracles which he performed.

24. But Jesus did not trust himself with them, because he knew them all.

25. He needed not to receive from others a character of any man, for he knew what was in man.

## John 3

1. Now there was a Pharisee called Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews,

2. who came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles which you do, unless God be with him.

3. Jesus answering, said to him, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not discern the Reign of God.

4. Nicodemus replied, How can a grown man be born? Can he enter his mother's womb anew, and be born?

5. Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born of water and Spirit, he can not enter the kingdom of God.

6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.

7. Wonder not, then, that I have said to you, You must be born again.

8. The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear the report of him, but know not whence he comes, or whither he goes; so is every one who is born of the spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered, How can these things be?

10. Jesus replied, Are you the teacher of Israel, and know not these things?

11. Most assuredly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet you receive not our testimony.

12. If you understood not, when I told you earthly things, how will you understand when I tell you heavenly things?

13. For none has ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven; the Son of Man, whose abode is heaven.

14. As Moses placed on high the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be placed on high;

15. that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but obtain eternal life:

16. for God has so loved the world, as to give his own begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him, may not perish, but obtain eternal life.

17. For God has sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world may be saved by him.

18. He who believes on him shall not be condemned; he who believes not, is already condemned, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. Now this is the ground of condemnation; that light has come into the world, and men have preferred the darkness to the light, because their deeds were evil.

20. For whosoever does evil, hates the light, and shuns it, lest his deeds should be detected.

21. But he who obeys the truth, comes to the light, that it may be manifest that his actions are agreeable to God.

22. After this, Jesus went, with his disciples, into the territory of Judea, where he remained with them, and immersed.

23. John also was immersing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came thither, and were immersed.

24. For John was not yet cast into prison.

25. Now John's disciples had a dispute with a Jew, about purification.

26. Then they went to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you near the Jordan, of whom you gave so great a character; he, too, immerses, and the people flock to him.

27. John answered, A man can have no power but what he derives from heaven.

28. You yourselves are witness for me, that I said, I am not the Messiah; but am sent before him.

29. The bridegroom is he who has the bride; but the friend of the bridegroom, who assists him, rejoices to hear the bridegroom's voice: this, my joy, therefore, is complete.

30. He must increase, while I decrease.

31. He who comes from above, is above all. He who is from the earth is earthly, and speaks as being from the earth. He who comes from heaven, is above all.

32. What he testifies, is what he has seen and heard; yet his testimony is not received.

33. He who receives his testimony, vouches the veracity of God.

34. for he whom God has commissioned, relates God's own words; for to him God gives not the Spirit by measure.

35. The Father loves the Son, and has subjected all things to him.

36. He who believes on the Son, has life eternal; he who rejects the Son, shall not see life: but the vengeance of God awaits him.

## John 4

1. Jesus, knowing that the Pharisees were informed that he made and immersed more disciples than John,

2. (though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who immersed,)

3. left Judea, and returned to Galilee.

4. Being obliged to pass through Samaria,

5. he came to a Samaritan city, called Sychar, near the heritage which Jacob gave his son Joseph.

6. Now Jacob's well was there. And Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat down by the well, it being about the sixth hour.

7. A woman of Samaria, having come to draw water, Jesus said to her, Give me some drink,

8. (for his disciples were gone into the city to buy food;)

9. the Samaritan woman answered, How is it, that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan? (For the Jews have no friendly intercourse with the Samaritans.)

10. Jesus replied, If you knew the bounty of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me some drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.

11. She answered, Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep: whence, then, have you the living water?

12. Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?

13. Jesus replied, Whosoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;

14. but whosoever will drink of the water which I shall give him, will never thirst more; but the water which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain, springing up to everlasting life.

15. The woman answered, Sir, give me this water, that I may never be thirsty, nor come hither to draw.

16. Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come back.

17. She answered, I have no husband. Jesus replied, You say well, I have no husband;

18. for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have, is not your husband. In this, you have spoken truth.

19. The woman said, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place, where me ought to worship.

21. Jesus answered, Woman, believe me, the time approaches when you shall neither come to this mountain, nor go to Jerusalem, to worship the Father.

22. You worship what you know not, we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.

23. But the time comes, or, rather, is come, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such are the worshipers whom the Father requires.

24. God is Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and truth.

25. The woman replied, I know that the Messiah comes, (that is, Christ;) when he is come, he will teach us all things.

26. Jesus said to her, I who speak to you, am he.

27. Upon this, his disciples came, and wondered that he talked with a woman; yet none of them said, What do you seek? or, Why do you talk with her?

28. Then the woman left her pitcher, and having gone into the city, said to the people,

29. Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is this not the Messiah?

30. They, accordingly, went out of the city, and came to him.

31. Meanwhile, the disciples entreating him, said, Rabbi, eat.

32. He answered, I have food to eat which you know not.

33. Then said his disciples, one to another, Has any man brought him food?

34. Jesus answered, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.

35. Do you not say, After four months comes harvest? But I say, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields; for they are already white enough for harvest.

36. The reaper receives wages, and gathers the fruits of eternal life, that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.

37. For in this, the proverb is verified, One sows, and another reaps.

38. I sent you to reap that on which you have bestowed no labor: others labored, and you get possession of their labors.

39. Now, many Samaritans of that city believed him, on the testimony of the woman, who said, He told me all that ever I did.

40. When, therefore, they came to him, they besought him to stay with them; and he staid there two days.

41. And many more believed, because of what they heard from himself;

42. and they said to the woman, It is not, now, on account of what you have reported, that we believe; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is truly the Saviour of the world, the Messiah.

43. After the two days, Jesus departed, and went to Galilee,

44. for he had himself declared that a prophet is not regarded in his own country.

45. Being come into Galilee, he was well received by the Galileans, who had seen all that he did at Jerusalem, during the festival; for they likewise attended the festival.

46. Then Jesus returned to Cana, of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain officer of the court, whose son lay sick at Capernaum,

47. who having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and entreated him to come and cure his son, who was dying.

48. Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and prodigies, you will not believe.

49. The officer answered, Come, Sir, before my child die.

50. Jesus replied, Go your way. Your son is well. And the man believed the word which Jesus had spoken, and went his way.

51. As he was returning, his servants met him, and informed him that his son was well.

52. He then inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They answered, Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.

53. Then the father knew, that it was the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son is well; and he, and all his family, believed.

54. This second miracle Jesus performed, after returning from Judea to Galilee.

## John 5

1. Afterward there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went to Jerusalem.

2. Now there is at Jerusalem, nigh the sheep gate, a bath, called, in Hebrew, Bethesda, which has five covered walks.

3. In these lay a great number of sick, blind, lame, and palsied people, waiting for the moving of the water,

4. (for a messenger at times descended into the bath, and agitated the water; and the first that stepped in, after the agitation of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had.)

5. Now, there was one there, who had been diseased thirty-eight years.

6. Jesus, who saw him lying, and knew that he had been long ill, said to him, Do you desire to be healed?

7. The diseased man answered, Sir, I have no person to put me into the bath, when the water is agitated; but while I am going, another gets down before me.

8. Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your couch and walk.

9. Instantly the man was healed, and took up his couch and walked.

10. Now, that day was the Sabbath. The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured, This is the Sabbath. It is now lawful for you to carry the couch.

11. He answered, He who healed me, said to me, Take up your couch and walk.

12. They asked him then, Who is the man that said to you, Take up your couch and walk?

13. But he that had been healed, knew who it was; for Jesus had slipped away, there being a crowd in the place.

14. Jesus, afterward, finding him in the temple, said to him, Behold, you are cured; sin no more, lest something worse befall you.

15. The man went, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.

16. Therefore, the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done this on the Sabbath.

17. But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now; I also work.

18. For this reason the Jews were the more intent to kill him; because he had not only broken the Sabbath, but, by calling God his real Father, had equaled himself to God.

19. Then Jesus addressed them, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but as he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, such does the Son, likewise.

20. For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself does: nay, and will show him greater works than these, which will astonish you.

21. For as the Father raises and quickens the dead, the Son also quickens whom he will:

22. for the Father judges no person, having committed the power of judging entirely to the Son,

23. that all might honor the Son; as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father, who sent him.

24. Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears my doctrine, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not suffer condemnation, having passed from death to life.

25. Most assuredly, I say to you, the time comes; or, rather, is come, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and hearing, they shall live.

26. For, as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son, to have life in himself;

27. and has given him even the judicial authority, because he is a Son of Man.

28. Wonder not at this: for the time comes when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice,

29. and shall come forth. They who have done good, shall arise to enjoy life; they who have done evil, shall arise to suffer punishment.

30. I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not to please myself, but to please him who sent me.

31. If I alone testify concerning myself, my testimony is not to be regarded:

32. there is another who testifies concerning me; and I know that his testimony of me ought to be regarded.

33. You, yourselves, sent to John, and he bore testimony of the truth.

34. As for me, I need no human testimony; I can only urge this for your salvation.

35. He was the blazing and shining lamp; and for awhile, you were glad to enjoy his light.

36. But I have greater testimony than John's: for the works which the Father has empowered me to perform, the works themselves, which I do, testify for me, that the Father has sent me.

37. Nay, the Father, who sent me, has himself attested me. Did you never hear his voice, or see his form?

38. Or, have you forgotten his declaration, that you believe not him whom he has sent forth?

39. You search the scriptures because you think to obtain by them eternal life. Now these, also, are witnesses for me;

40. yet you will not come to me, that you may obtain life.

41. I desire not honor from men;

42. but I know you, that you are strangers to the love of God.

43. I am come in my Father's name, and you did not receive me; if another come, in his own name, you will receive him.

44. How can you believe, while you court honor one from another, regardless of the honor which comes from God alone?

45. Do not think that I am he who will accuse you to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you confide.

46. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me: for he wrote concerning me.

47. But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?

## John 6

1. Afterward, Jesus crossed the sea of Galilee, also called of Tiberias;

2. and a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the miraculous cures which he had performed.

3. And Jesus went up on a mountain; where he sat down with his disciples.

4. Now the passover, the Jewish festival, was near.

5. Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and perceiving that a great multitude was flocking to him, said to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread to feed these people?

6. (This he said to try him; for he knew himself, what he was to do.)

7. Philip answered, Two hundred denarii would not purchase bread enough to afford every one a morsel.

8. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,

9. Here is a boy who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?

10. Jesus said, Make the men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So they reclined; in number about five thousand.

11. And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to those who had reclined. He gave them also of the fishes, as much as they would.

12. When they had eat sufficiently, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.

13. They, therefore, gathered, and with the fragments which the people had left of the five barley loaves, they filled twelve baskets.

14. When those men had seen the miracle which Jesus had wrought they said, This is certainly the prophet who comes into the world.

15. Then Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and carry him off, to make him king, withdrew again, alone, to the mountain.

16. In the evening, his disciples went to the sea,

17. and having embarked, were passing by sea to Capernaum. It was now dark; and Jesus had not come to them.

18. And the water was raised by a tempestuous wind.

19. When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they observed Jesus walking on the sea, very near the bark, and were afraid.

20. But he said to them, It is I, be not afraid.

21. Then they gladly received him into the bark; and the bark was immediately at the place whither they were going.

22. On the next day, the people who were on the seaside, knowing that there had been but one boat there, and that Jesus went not into the boat with his disciples, who went alone,

23. (other boats, however, arrived from Tiberias, nigh the place where they had eat, after the Lord had given thanks;)

24. knowing, besides, that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, embarked, and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

25. Having found him on the opposite shore, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come hither?

26. Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw miracles, but because you eat of the loaves, and were satisfied.

27. Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures through eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for to him the Father, that is, God, has given his attestation.

28. They asked him, therefore, What are the works which God requires us to do?

29. Jesus answered, This is the work which God requires-- that you believe on him whom he has sent forth.

30. They replied, What miracles, then, do you, that seeing it, we may believe you? What do you perform?

31. «Our fathers eat the manna in the desert; as it is written,» 'He gave them bread of heaven to eat.'

32. Jesus then said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread of heaven: but my Father gives you the true bread of heaven:

33. for the bread of God is that which descends from heaven, and gives life to the world.

34. They said, therefore, to him, Master, give us always this bread.

35. Jesus answered, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me, shall never hunger; and he who believes on me, shall never thirst.

36. But, as I told you, though you have seen me, you do not believe.

37. All the Father gives me, will come to me; and him who comes to me, I will not reject.

38. For I descended from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.

39. Now, this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none of all he has given me, but raise the whole again at the last day.

40. This is the will of him who sent me, that whoever recognizes the Son, and believes on him, should obtain eternal life, and that I should raise him again at the last day.

41. The Jews then murmured against him, because he said, I am the bread which descended from heaven:

42. and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I descended from heaven!

43. Jesus answered, Murmur not amongst yourselves:

44. no man can come to me, unless the Father, who has sent me, draw him; and him I will raise again at the last day.

45. «It is written in the prophets,» 'They shall be taught of God.' 'Every one who has heard, and learned from the Father, comes to me.'

46. Not that any man, except him who is from God, has seen the Father.

47. Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes on me has eternal life.

48. I am the bread of life.

49. Your fathers eat the manna in the desert, and died.

50. Behold the bread which descended from heaven, that whosoever eats of it may not die.

51. I am the living bread, which descended from heaven. Whosoever eats of this bread, shall live forever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world.

52. The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

53. Jesus, therefore, said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life in you.

54. He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him again at the last day:

55. for my flesh is truly meat, and my blood is truly drink.

56. He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I abide in him.

57. As the Father lives, who sent me; and I live by the Father; even so he, who feeds on me, shall live by me.

58. This is the bread which descended from heaven. It is not like what your fathers eat, for they died: he that eats this bread, shall live for ever.

59. This discourse he spoke in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.

60. Many of his disciples having heard it, said, This is hard doctrine; who can understand it?

61. Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, Does this offend you?

62. What if you should see the Son of Man reascending thither, where he was before?

63. It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing. The words which I speak to you, are spirit and life.

64. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who he was that would betray him.)

65. He added, Therefore, I said to you, that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.

66. From this time, many of his disciples withdrew, and accompanied him no longer.

67. Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?

68. Simon Peter answered, Master, to whom should we go? You have the words of eternal life:

69. and we believe, and know that you are the Holy One of God.

70. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve? yet one of you is a spy.

71. He meant Judas Iscariot, son of Simon; for it was he who was to betray him, though he was one of the twelve.

## John 7

1. After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he would not reside in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.

2. Now, the Jewish feast of tabernacles was near.

3. His brothers, therefore, said to him, Leave this country, and go to Judea, that your disciples may also see the works which you do.

4. For whoever courts renown, does nothing in secret: since you perform such things, show yourself to the world.

5. (For not even his brothers believed on him.)

6. Jesus answered, My time is not yet come; any time will suit you.

7. The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I disclose the wickedness of its actions.

8. Go you to this festival: I go not thither, because it is not my time.

9. Having said this, he remained in Galilee.

10. But when his brothers were gone, he also went to the festival; not publicly, but rather privately.

11. At the festival, the Jews inquired after him, and said, Where is he?

12. And there was much whispering among the people concerning him. Some said, He is a good man. Others, No; he seduces the multitude.

13. No person, however, spoke freely of him, for fear of the Jews.

14. About the middle of the festival, Jesus went into the temple, and was teaching.

15. And the Jews said with astonishment, Whence comes this man's learning, who was never taught?

16. Jesus made answer, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.

17. If any one will do his will, he shall discern whether my doctrine proceeds from God, or from myself.

18. Whosoever teaches what proceeds from himself, seeks to promote his own glory: whosoever seeks to promote the glory of him who sent him, deserves credit, and is a stranger to deceit.

19. Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?

20. The people answered, You are possessed. Who seeks to kill you.

21. Jesus replied, I have performed one action, which surprises you all.

22. Moses instituted circumcision among you, (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and you circumcise on the Sabbath.

23. If, on the Sabbath, a man receive circumcision, that the law of Moses may not be violated; are you incensed against me, because, on the Sabbath, I have cured a man, whose whole body was disabled?

24. Judge not from personal regards, but judge according to justice.

25. Then some inhabitants of Jerusalem, said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?

26. Lo! he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers, indeed, acknowledge that this is the Messiah?

27. But we know whence this man is; whereas, when the Messiah shall come, no person will know whence he is.

28. Jesus, who was then teaching in the temple, cried, Do you know both who, and whence I am? I came not of myself. But he is true, who sent me, whom you know not.

29. As for me, I know him, because I came from him, and am commissioned by him.

30. Then they sought to apprehend him, but none laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

31. Many of the people, however, believed on him, and said, When the Messiah shall come, will he do more miracles than this man does?

32. When the Pharisees heard that the people muttered such things concerning him, they and the chief priests dispatched officers to seize him.

33. Jesus, therefore, said, Yet a little while I remain with you; then I go to him who sent me.

34. You shall seek me, but shall not find me; nor be able to come where I am.

35. The Jews said, among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

36. What does he mean, by saying, You shall seek me, but shall not find me, nor be able to get thither, where I shall be.

37. On the last, and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.

38. He who believes on me, as the scripture says, shall be like a cistern, whence rivers of living waters shall flow.

39. This he spoke of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.

40. Many of the people having heard what was spoken, said, This is certainly the prophet.

41. Some said, This is the Messiah. Others, does the Messiah come from Galilee?

42. Does not the scripture say, that the Messiah will be of the posterity of David, and come from Bethlehem, the village whence David was?

43. Thus the people were divided concerning him;

44. and some of them would have seized him, but no person laid hands upon him.

45. Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, Wherefore have you not brought him?

46. The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.

47. The Pharisees replied, Are you also seduced?

48. Has any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed on him?

49. But this populace, which knows not the law, is accursed.

50. Nicodemus, one of themselves, (he who came to Jesus by night,)

51. said to them, Does our law permit us to condemn a man, without hearing him, and knowing what he has done?

52. They answered him, Are you also a Galilean? Search, and you will find that prophets arise not out of Galilee.

53. Then every man went to his own house;

## John 8

1. but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

2. Early in the morning he returned to the temple, and all the people having come to him, he sat down and taught them.

3. Then the Scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman, taken in adultery; and having placed her in the middle,

4. said to him, Rabbi, this woman was surprised in the act of adultery.

5. Now Moses has commanded in the law, that such should be stoned; and what do you say?

6. They said this to try him, that they might have matter for accusing him. But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing with his finger, upon the ground.

7. As they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, Let him who is sinless, amongst you, throw the first stone at her.

8. Again, having stooped down, he wrote upon the ground.

9. They, hearing that, withdrew, one after another, the eldest first, till Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the middle.

10. Jesus, raising himself, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those, your accusers? Has no person passed sentence on you?

11. She answered, No person, Sir. Jesus said to her, Neither do I pass sentence on you. Go, and sin no more.

12. Again Jesus addressed the people, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

13. The Pharisees therefore retorted, You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not to be regarded.

14. Jesus answered, Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony ought to be regarded; because I know whence I came, and whither I go. As for you, you know not whence I came, and whither I go.

15. You judge from passion; I judge no person:

16. and if I do, my judgment ought to be regarded, for I am not alone, but concur with the Father, who sent me.

17. It is a maxim in your law, that the concurrent testimony of two is credible.

18. Now I am one who testify concerning myself; the Father that sent me is another that testifies of me.

19. Then they asked him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me nor my Father: if you knew me, you would know my Father also.

20. These things he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple, and no person seized him, his hour not being yet come.

21. Again, Jesus said to them, I am going away; you will seek me, and shall die in your sins; whither I go, you can not come.

22. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself, that he says, Whither I go, you can not come?

23. He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world;

24. therefore I said, You shall die in your sins; for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.

25. They, therefore, asked him, Who are you? Jesus answered, The same that I told you formerly.

26. I have many things to say of you, and to reprove in you: but he who sent me is worthy of belief; and I do but publish to the world what I have learned from him.

27. They did not perceive, that he meant the Father.

28. Jesus, therefore, said to them, When you shall have raised the Son of Man on high, then you shall know what I am; and that I do nothing of myself, and say nothing which the Father has not taught me.

29. And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.

30. While he spoke thus, many believed on him.

31. Jesus, therefore, said to those Jews who believed on him, If you persevere in my doctrine, you are my disciples indeed.

32. And you shall know the truth: and the truth shall make you free.

33. Some made answer, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never enslaved to any man. How do you say, You shall be made free?

34. Jesus replied, Most assuredly, I say to you, whosoever commits sin is a slave of sin.

35. Now the slave abides not in the family perpetually, the Son abides perpetually.

36. If, therefore, the Son make you free, you will be free indeed.

37. I know that you are Abraham's offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my doctrine has no place in you.

38. I speak what I have seen with my Father: and you do what you have learned from your father.

39. They answered, Abraham is our Father. Jesus replied, If you were Abraham's children, you would act as Abraham acted.

40. But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I received from God. Abraham acted not thus.

41. You do the deeds of your father. They answered, We were not born of fornication, We have one Father, even God.

42. Jesus replied, If God were your Father, you would love me; for I proceeded, and am come from God. I came not of myself. He sent me.

43. Why do you not understand my language? It is because you can not bear my doctrine.

44. The devil is your father, and the desires of your father you will gratify: he was a manslayer from the beginning; he swerved from the truth, because there was no veracity in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks suitably to his character; for he is a liar, and the father of lying.

45. As for me, because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.

46. Who of you convicts me of falsehood? And if I speak truth, why do you not believe me?

47. He who is of God, regards God's words. You regard them not, because you are not of God.

48. The Jews then answered, Have we not reason to say, You are a Samaritan, and have a demon?

49. Jesus replied, I have not a demon: but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.

50. As for me, I seek not to promote my own glory; another seeks it, who judges.

51. Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever keeps my word, shall never see death.

52. The Jews then said to him, Now we are certain that you have a demon: Abraham is dead, and the prophets; yet you say, Whoever keeps my word, shall never taste death.

53. Are you greater than our Father Abraham, who is dead. The prophets also are dead: whom do you make yourself?

54. Jesus answered, If I commend myself, my commendation is nothing: it is my Father, whom you call your God, who commends me.

55. Nevertheless, you know him not; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should speak falsely like you: but I know him, and keep his word.

56. Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he should see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.

57. The Jews replied, You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?

58. Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.

59. Then they took up stones to cast at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple.

## John 9

1. As Jesus passed along, he saw a man who had been born blind.

2. And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned: this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?

3. Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned. It was only that the works of God might be displayed upon him.

4. I must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.

5. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

6. Having said this, he spit upon the ground, and with the clay, which he made with the spittle, anointed the blind man's eyes,

7. and said to him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam, (which signifies Sent.) He went, therefore, and washed them, and returned seeing.

8. Then the neighbors, and they who had before seen him blind, said, Is not this he who sat and begged?

9. Some said, It is he; others, He is like him. He said, I am he.

10. They asked him, then, How did you receive your sight?

11. He answered, A man called Jesus, made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash your eyes. I went accordingly, and washed them, and saw.

12. Then they asked him, Where is he? He answered, I know not.

13. Then they brought him, who had been blind, to the Pharisees;

14. (now it was on a Sabbath, that Jesus made the clay, and gave him his sight.)

15. The Pharisees likewise, therefore, asked him how he had received his sight. He answered, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now see.

16. Upon this some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, for he observes not the Sabbath. Others said, How can one that is a sinner perform such miracles? And they were divided among themselves.

17. Again they asked the man, who had been blind, What do you say of him, for giving you sight? He answered, He is a prophet.

18. But the Jews believed not that the man had been blind, and had received his sight; till they called his parents,

19. and asked them, Do you say, that this is your son, who was born blind? How, then, does he now see?

20. His parents answered, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:

21. but how he now sees, or who opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age, ask him; he will answer for himself.

22. His parents spoke thus, because they fear the Jews: for the Jews had already determined, that whosoever acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah, should be expelled from the synagogue.

23. For this reason his parents said, He is of age, ask him.

24. A second time, therefore, they called the man, who had been born blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.

25. He replied, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, I now see.

26. They said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he make you see?

27. He answered, I told you before; did you not hear? Why would you hear it repeated? Will you, also, be his disciples?

28. They reviled him and said, You are his disciple. As for us, we are disciples of Moses.

29. We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not whence he is.

30. The man replied, This is surprising, that you know not whence he is, although he has given me sight.

31. We know that God hears not sinners; but if any man worship God, and obey him, that man he hears.

32. Never was it heard before, that any man gave sight to one born blind.

33. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.

34. They replied, You were altogether born in sin, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.

35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having met him, said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?

36. He answered, Who is he, Sir, that I may believe on him?

37. Jesus said to him, Not only have you seen him; but it is he, who talks with you.

38. And he cried, Master, I believe; and threw himself prostrate before him.

39. And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not, may see; and that they who see, may become blind.

40. Some Pharisees, who were present, hearing this, said to him, Are we also blind?

41. Jesus answered, If you were blind, you would not have sin: but you say, We see: therefore your sin remains.

## John 10

1. Most assuredly, I say to you, he who enters not by the gate into the sheepfold, but climbs over the fence, is a thief and a robber.

2. The shepherd always enters by the gate.

3. To him, the porter opens, and the sheep obey his voice. His own sheep he calls by name, and leads out.

4. And having put out his sheep, he walks before them, and they follow him; because they know his voice.

5. They will not follow a stranger, but flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.

6. Jesus addressed this similitude to them, but they did not comprehend what he said.

7. He therefore added, Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the gate of the fold.

8. All who preceded me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep obeyed them not.

9. I am the gate: such as enter by me shall be safe: they shall go in and out, and find pasture.

10. The thief comes in only to steal, to slay, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.

11. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for his sheep.

12. The hireling, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, when he sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and flees; and the wolf tears them, and disperses the flock.

13. The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.

14. I am the good shepherd. And I know my own, and am known by them,

15. (even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father;) and I give my life for the sheep.

16. I have other sheep, besides, which are not of this fold. Them I must also bring; and they will obey my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.

17. For this the Father loves me, because I give my life, to be afterward resumed.

18. No one forces it from me: but I give it of myself. I have power to give it, and I have power to resume it. This commandment I have received from my Father.

19. Again there was a division among the Jews, occasioned by this discourse.

20. Many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad: why do you hear him?

21. Others said, These are not the words of a demonize. Can a demon give sight to the blind?

22. Afterward, when they were celebrating the feast of the dedication, at Jerusalem,

23. it being in winter; as Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's portico,

24. the Jews surrounding him, said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you be the Messiah, tell us plainly.

25. Jesus answered, I told you; but you believed not. The works which I do in my Father's name, testify of me.

26. But you believe not, for you are not of my sheep.

27. My sheep, as I told you, obey my voice; I know them, and they follow me.

28. Besides, I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any one wrest them out of my hands.

29. My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all; and none can wrest them out of my Father's hand.

30. I and the Father are one.

31. Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him.

32. Jesus said to them, Many good works I have shown you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?

33. The Jews answered, For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.

34. «Jesus replied, Is it not written in your law,'I said, You are gods?'»

35. If the law styled them gods, to whom the word of God was addressed, and if the language of scripture in unexceptionable;

36. do you charge him with blasphemy whom the Father has consecrated his Apostle to the world, for calling himself his Son?

37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

38. But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I am in him.

39. They then attempted again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hands,

40. and retired again toward the Jordan, and abode in the place where John first immersed.

41. And many resorted to him, who said, John, indeed, wrought no miracle: but all that John spoke of this man, is true.

42. And many believed on him there.

## John 11

1. Now, one Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.

2. (It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with balsam, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

3. The sisters, therefore, sent to tell Jesus, Master, lo! he whom you love, is sick.

4. Jesus hearing it, said, This sickness will not prove fatal; but conduce to the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.

5. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

6. Having, then, heard that he was sick, Jesus staid two days in the place where he was.

7. Afterward, he said to the disciples, Let us return to Judea.

8. The disciples answered, Rabbi, but very lately the Jews would have stoned you, and you would return thither?

9. Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not: because he sees the light of the world:

10. but if he walk in the night, he stumbles; because there is no light.

11. Having spoken this, he added, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go to wake him.

12. Then said his disciples, Master, if he sleep, he will recover.

13. Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.

14. Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

15. And on your account I am glad that I was not there, that you may believe; but let us go to him.

16. Then Thomas, that is, Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us go, that we may die with him.

17. When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.

18. Now, (Bethany being about fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem,)

19. many of the Jews came to Martha, and Mary, to comfort them on the death of their brother.

20. Martha having heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary remained in the house.

21. Then Martha said to Jesus, Master, if you had been here, my brother had not died.

22. But I know that even now, whatever you shall ask of God, God will give you.

23. Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.

24. Martha replied, I know that he will rise at the resurrection, on the last day.

25. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes on me, though he were dead, shall live;

26. and no man who lives and believes on me, shall ever die. Do you believe this?

27. She answered, Yes, Master, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.

28. Having said this, she went and called Mary, her sister, aside, saying, The Teacher is come, and calls for you.

29. When Mary heard this, she instantly rose and went to him.

30. Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.

31. The Jews, then, who were condoling with Mary in the house, when they saw that she arose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.

32. Mary being come to the place where Jesus was, and seeing him, threw herself at his feet, saying, Had you be here, Master, my brother had not died.

33. When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping, who came with her, he groaned deeply, and was troubled,

34. and said, Where have you laid him? They answered, and said, Master, come and see.

35. Jesus wept.

36. The Jews, therefore, said, Mark how he loved him.

37. But some of them said, Could not he who gave sight to the blind man, even have prevented this man's death?

38. Jesus, therefore, again, groaning, came to the tomb. It was a cave, the entrance of which was shut up with a stone.

39. Jesus said, Remove the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, answered, Sir, by this time, the smell is offensive, for this is the fourth day.

40. Jesus replied, Did I not say to you, If you believe, you shall see the glory of God?

41. Then they removed the stone. And Jesus, lifting up his eyes, said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

42. As for me, I know that thou hearest me always; but I speak, for the people's sake who surround me, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

43. After these words, raising his voice, he cried, Lazarus, come forth!

44. He who had been dead, came forth, bound hand and foot with fillets, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.

45. Many, therefore, of the Jews, who had come to Mary, and seen what he did, believed on him.

46. But some of the repaired to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.

47. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled the Sanhedrim, and said, What are we doing? for this man works many miracles.

48. If we let him go on thus, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation.

49. One of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You are utterly at a loss,

50. and do not consider, that it is better for us that one man die for the people, than that the whole nation should be ruined.

51. This he spoke, not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;

52. and not for that nation only, but that he should assemble into one body the dispersed children of God.

53. From that day, therefore, they concerted how they might destroy him.

54. For that reason, Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews, but retired to the country, near the desert, to a city called Ephraim; and continued there with his disciples.

55. Meantime, the Jewish passover approached, and many went to Jerusalem from the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.

56. These inquired after Jesus, and said, one to another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think? Will he not come to the festival?

57. Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order, that whosoever knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might apprehend him.

## John 12

1. Six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.

2. There they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of those who were at table with him.

3. Then Mary, taking a pound of the balsam of spikenard, which was very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair, so that the house was filled with the odor of the balsam.

4. On which, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray him, said,

5. Why was not this balsam sold for three hundred denarii, which might have been given to the poor?

6. This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and carried what was put in it.

7. Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has reserved this to embalm me, against the day of my burial.

8. For you will always have the poor among you; but me you will not always have.

9. A great number of the Jews, knowing where he was, flocked thither, not on account of Jesus only, but likewise to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

10. The chief priests, therefore, determined to kill Lazarus also;

11. because he proved the occasion that many Jews forsook them, and believed on Jesus.

12. On the next day, a great multitude, who were come to the festival, hearing that Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem,

13. took branches of palm trees, and went out to meet him, crying, Hosanna! blessed be Israel's King, who comes in the name of the Lord.

14. Now Jesus having found a young ass, was riding on it, agreeably to what is written,

15. «Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.»

16. These things the disciples did not understand, at first; but after Jesus was glorified, they remembered that thus it had been written concerning him, and that thus they had done to him.

17. And the people who had been present, attested that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.

18. It was the rumor that he had wrought this miracle, which made the people crowd to meet him.

19. The Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, Are you not sensible that you have no influence? Behold the world is gone after him.

20. Now, among those who came to worship at the festival, there were some Greeks.

21. These applied to Philip, of Bethsaida, in Galilee, making this request, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.

22. Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

23. Jesus answered them, saying, The time is come, when the Son of Man must be glorified.

24. Most assuredly, I say to you, when a grain of wheat is thrown into the ground, unless it die, it remains single; but if it die, it becomes very fruitful.

25. He who loves his life shall lose it; and he who hates his life in this world, shall preserve it eternally in the next.

26. Would any man serve me? let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any man serve me, my Father will reward him.

27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But I came on purpose for this hour.

28. Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice out of heaven, which said, I have both glorified, and will again glorify it.

29. The people present heard the sound, and said, It thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.

30. Jesus said, This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.

31. Now must this world be judged. Now must the prince of this world be cast out.

32. As for me, when I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself.

33. This he said, alluding to the death which he was to suffer.

34. The people answered, We have learned from the law, that the Messiah will live forever. How do you say, then, that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?

35. Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the light continues with you; walk, while you have it, lest darkness overtake you: for he that walks in darkness knows not whither he goes.

36. Confide in the light, while you enjoy it, that you may be sons of light. Having spoken these words, he withdrew himself privately from them.

37. But, though he had performed so many miracles before them, they believed not on him;

38. «so that the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,» 'Lord, who has believed out report?' 'and, '«To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?»

39. For this reason they could not believe; Isaiah having said, also,

40. «He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their understanding, that they might not see with their eyes, comprehend with their understanding, and be converted, that I might heal them.»

41. These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke concerning him.

42. Nevertheless, there were several, even of the magistrates, who believed on him; but, for fear of the Pharisees, did not avow it, lest they should be expelled the synagogue;

43. for they preferred approbation of men to the approbation of God.

44. Then Jesus, raising his voice, said, He who believes on me, believes not on me only; but on him who sent me.

45. And he who beholds me, beholds him who sent me.

46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me, may not remain in darkness.

47. And if any man hear my words, but do not observe them; it is not I, who condemn him; for I came, not to condemn the world, but to save the world.

48. He who despises me, and rejects my instructions, has that which condemns him. The doctrine which I have taught will condemn him at the last day.

49. For I have not said anything from myself; but the Father who sent me, has commanded me what I should enjoin, and what I should teach.

50. And I know, that his commandment is eternal life. Whatever, therefore, I say, I speak as the Father has given me in charge.

## John 13

1. Jesus having perceived, before the feast of the passover, that his time to remove out of this world to his Father, was come; and having loved his own, who were in the world, he loved them to the last.

2. Now while they were at the supper, (the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,)

3. Jesus, though he knew that the Father had subjected everything to him, and that he came from God, and was returning to God;

4. arose from supper, and laying aside his mantle, girt himself about with a towel.

5. Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.

6. When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, Master, would you wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered, At present you do not comprehend what I am doing; but you shall know hereafter.

8. Peter replied, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered, Unless I wash you, you can have no part with me.

9. Simon Peter said to him, Master, not my feet only; but also my hands and my head.

10. Jesus replied, He who has been bathing, needs only to wash his feet; the rest of his body being clean.

11. You are clean, but not all. For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, You are not all clean.

12. After he had washed their feet, he put on his mantle, and replacing himself at table, said to them, Do you understand what I have been doing to you?

13. You call me the Teacher and the Master; and you say right; for so I am.

14. If I, then, the Master and the Teacher, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.

15. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.

16. Most assuredly, I say to you, the servant is not greater than his master, nor is the apostle greater than he who sends him.

17. Happy are you, who know these things, provided you practice them.

18. «I speak not of you all. I know whom I have chosen: but the scripture must be fulfilled,'He that eats at my table, has lifted up his heel against me.'»

19. I tell you this now, before it happen; that when it happens, you may believe that I am the Messiah.

20. Most assuredly, I say to you, he that receives whomsoever I send, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him who sent me.

21. After uttering these words, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.

22. Then the disciples looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.

23. Now one of his disciples, one whom Jesus loved, was lying close to his breast:

24. Simon Peter, therefore, made a sign to him, to inquire whom he meant.

25. He, then, reclining on Jesus' bosom, said to him, Master, who is it?

26. Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel, after I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

27. After receiving the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.

28. But none at the table knew, why he gave this order.

29. Some imagined, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had signified to him to buy necessaries for the festival; or, to give something to the poor.

30. When Judas had taken the morsel, he immediately went out: and it was night.

31. When he was gone, Jesus said, the Son of Man is now glorified, and God is glorified by him.

32. If God is glorified by him, God also will glorify him by himself, and that without delay.

33. My children, I have now but a little time to be with you. You will seek me, and what I said to the Jews, Whither I go, you can not come; I say at present to you.

34. A new commandment I give you, that you love one another; that as I have loved you, you also love one another.

35. By this shall all men know, that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.

36. Simon Peter said to him, Master, whither are you going? Jesus answered, Whither I am going, you can not follow me now; but afterward you shall follow me.

37. Peter replied, Master, why can not I follow you presently? I will lay down my life for your sake!

38. Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Most assuredly, I say to you, the cock shall not crow, till you have disowned me thrice.

## John 14

1. Let not your heart be troubled; believe on God, and believe on me.

2. In my Father's house are many mansions. Were it otherwise, I would have told you.

3. I go to prepare a place for you: and after I shall have gone, and prepared a place for you; I will return and take you with me, that where I am, there you may be also.

4. And whither I am going, you know, and the way you know.

5. Thomas said to him, Master, we know not whither you are going. How, then, can we know the way?

6. Jesus answered, I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no man comes to the Father, but by me.

7. Had you known me, you would have known my Father also; and henceforth you know him, and have seen him.

8. Philip said to him, Master, show us the Father, and it will satisfy us.

9. Jesus replied, Have I been with you so long, and do you not yet know me, Philip? He that has seen me, has seen the Father. How do you say, then, Show us the Father?

10. Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words which I speak to you proceed not form myself: as to the works, it is the Father dwelling in me who does them.

11. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; if not on my testimony, be convinced by the works themselves.

12. Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes on me, shall himself do such works as I do; nay, even greater than these shall he do; because I go to my Father,

13. and will do whatsoever you shall ask in my name. That the Father may be glorified in the Son,

14. whatsoever you shall ask in my name, I will do.

15. If you love me, keep my commandments;

16. and I will entreat the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to continue with you forever;

17. even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world can not receive, because it neither sees him, nor knows him; but you shall know him, because he will abide with you, and be in you.

18. I will not leave you forlorn; I will return to you.

19. Yet a little while, and the world shall see me no more; but you shall see me; because I live, you also shall live.

20. On that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me; and I in you.

21. He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and he who loves me, will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.

22. Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Master, wherefore will you manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?

23. Jesus answering, said to him, If a man love me, he will observe my word; and my Father will love him; and we will come to him, and dwell with him.

24. He who loves me not, disregards my words; yet the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's, who sent me.

25. I tell you these things, while I remain with you.

26. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and remind you of all that I have told you.

27. Peace I leave you; my peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Be not disheartened; be not intimidated.

28. You have heard me say, I go away, and will return to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice that I go to the Father; because my Father is greater than I.

29. This I tell you now, before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe.

30. I shall not, henceforth, have much conversation with you; for the prince of the world is coming, though he will find nothing in me;

31. but this must be that the world may know that I love the Father, and do whatsoever he commands me. Arise, let us go hence.

## John 15

1. I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine dresser.

2. Every barren branch in me, he lops off; every fruitful branch he cleans by pruning, to render it more fruitful.

3. As for you, you are already clean, through the instructions I have given you.

4. Abide in me, and I will abide in you; as the branch can not bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, no more can you, unless you abide in me.

5. I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in me, and in whom I abide, produces much fruit; for, severed from me, you can do nothing.

6. If any man abide not in me, he is cast forth like withered branches, which are gathered for fuel, and burnt.

7. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you may ask what you will, and it shall be granted you.

8. In this is my Father glorified, that you produce much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.

9. As the Father loves me, so do I love you: continue in my love.

10. If you keep my commandments, you shall continue in my love; as I have kept my Father's commandments, and continue in his love.

11. I give you these admonitions, that I may continue to have joy in you, and that your joy may be complete.

12. This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I love you.

13. No man has greater love than this, to lay down his life for his friends.

14. You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.

15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his master will do: but I name you friends; for whatever I have learned from my Father, I impart to you.

16. It is not you who have chosen me; but it is I who have chosen you, and ordained you to go and bear fruit: fruit which will prove permanent, that the Father may give you whatsoever you shall ask him in my name.

17. This I command you, that you love one another.

18. If the world hate you, consider that it hated me, before it hated you.

19. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, I having selected you from the world, the world hates you.

20. Remember what I said to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have observed my word, they will also observe yours.

21. But all this treatment they will give you on my account, because they know not him who sent me.

22. If I had not come, and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. He that hates me, hates my Father also.

24. If I had not done among them such works as none other ever did, they had not had sin; but now they have seen them, and yet hated both me and my Father.

25. «Thus they verify that passage in their law,'They hated me without cause.'»

26. But when the Advocate is come, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify concerning me.

27. And you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.

## John 16

1. These things I tell you, that you may not be discouraged.

2. They will expel you from the synagogue; nay, the time is coming, when, whosoever kills you, will think he offers sacrifice to God.

3. And these things they will do, because they know not the Father nor me.

4. Of these things I warn you now, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I mentioned them to you. I did not, indeed, mention them at the beginning, because I was with you myself.

5. And now I go away to him who sent me; yet none of you ask me, Whither do you go?

6. But because of those things which I have foretold you, you are overwhelmed with grief.

7. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is for your good that I depart; for if I do not depart, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go away, I will send him to you.

8. And when he is come, he will convince the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment:

9. concerning sin, because they believe not on me;

10. concerning righteousness because I go to my Father, and you see me no longer;

11. concerning judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

12. I have many things still to tell you, but you can not yet bear them.

13. But when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will conduct you into all the truth: for his words will not proceed from himself: but whatsoever he shall have heard, he will speak, and show you things to come.

14. He will glorify me: for he will take of mine and communicate to you.

15. Whatsoever is the Father's, is mine; therefore, I say that he will take of mine to communicate to you.

16. A little while you shall not see me; a little while after, you shall see me; because I go to the Father.

17. Some of the disciples said among themselves, What does he mean by this; a little while you shall not see me; a little while after, you shall see me; because I go to the Father?

18. What means this little while, of which he speaks? We do not comprehend it.

19. Jesus perceiving that they were desirous to ask him, said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves about this that I said, A little while you shall not see me; a little while after, you shall see me?

20. Most assuredly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

21. A woman in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come. But when her son is born, she remembers her anguish no longer; for joy that she has brought a man into the world.

22. So, you, at present, are in grief; but I will visit you again, and your hearts shall be joyful, and none shall rob you of your joy.

23. On that day, you will put no questions to me. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father, in my name, he will give you.

24. Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be complete.

25. These things I have spoken to you in figures: the time approaches when I shall no more discourse to you in figures, but instruct you plainly concerning the Father.

26. The you will ask in my name, and I say not, that I will entreat the Father for you:

27. for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and believed that I came from God.

28. From the presence of the Father I cam into the world. Again, I leave the world, and return to the Father.

29. His disciples replied, Now, indeed, you speak plainly, and without a figure.

30. Now we are convinced that you know all things, and need not that any should put questions to you. By this we believe that you came forth from God.

31. Jesus answered, Do you now believe?

32. Behold, the time comes, or rather is come, when you shall disperse, every one to his own, and shall leave me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

33. These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage! I have overcome the world.

## John 17

1. When Jesus had ended this discourse, he said, lifting up his eyes to heaven, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee;

2. as thou hast given him authority over all men, that he may bestow eternal life, on all those whom thou hast given him.

3. Now this is the life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus, the Messiah, thy Apostle.

4. I have glorified thee upon the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

5. And now, Father, glorify thou me in thy own presence, with that glory which I enjoyed with thee, before the world was.

6. I have made known thy name to the men whom those hast given me of the world. They were thine; and thou hast given them to me; and they have kept thy word.

7. Whatsoever thou hast given me, they now know to have come from thee;

8. and that thou hast imparted to me the doctrine, which I have imparted to them. They have received it, knowing for certain, that I came forth from thee, and am commissioned by thee.

9. It is for them that I pray. I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; because they are thine.

10. And all mine are thine, and thine mine, and I am glorified in them.

11. I continue no longer in the world; but these continue in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, preserve them in thy name, whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; those whom thou hast given me, I have preserved. None of them in lost, except the son of perdition, as the scripture foretold.

13. But now that I am coming to thee, I speak these things in the world, that their joy in me may be complete.

14. I have delivered thy word to them, and the world hates them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

15. I do not pray thee to remove them out of the world, but to preserve them from evil.

16. Of the world they are not, as I am not of the world.

17. Consecrate them by the truth; thy word is the truth.

18. As thou hast made me thy Apostle to the world, I have made them my Apostles to the world.

19. And I consecrate myself for them, that they may be consecrated through the truth.

20. Nor do I pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on me through their teaching;

21. that all may be one; that as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me;

22. and that thou gavest me the glory, which I have given them; that they may be one, as we are one;

23. I in them, and thou in me, that their union may be perfected; that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou lovest them, as thou lovest me.

24. Father, I would that where I shall be, those whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou gavest me, because thou lovedst me before the formation of the world.

25. Righteous Father, though the world knows not thee, I know thee; and these know that I have thy commission.

26. And to them I have communicated, and will communicate thy name: that I being in them, they may share in the love with which thou lovest me.

## John 18

1. When Jesus had spoken these words, he passed, with his disciples, over the brook Kidron; where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.

2. Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.

3. Then Judas, having got the cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came thither with lanterns, and torches, and arms.

4. But Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom do you seek?

5. They answered him, Jesus, the Nazarene. Jesus replied, I am he. Now Judas, who betrayed him, was with them.

6. He had no sooner said to them, I am he, than they, going backward, fell to the ground.

7. He, therefore, asked them again, Whom do you seek? They said, Jesus, the Nazarene.

8. Jesus answered, I have told you, that I am he. If, therefore, you seek me, let these go away.

9. Thus was that which he had spoken verified, Of those whom thou gavest me, I have lost none.

10. Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.

11. Jesus then said to Peter, Put up the sword into the scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?

12. Then the cohort, and their commander, and the Jewish officers, apprehended Jesus; and having bound him,

13. brought him first to Annas, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

14. Now it was Caiaphas, who had said in council to the Jews, It is expedient that one man die for the people.

15. Meantime Simon Peter, and another disciple, followed Jesus. That disciple, being known to the high priest, entered his court with Jesus.

16. But Peter stood without, at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.

17. Then the maid, the portress, said to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He answered, I am not.

18. Now, the servants and the officers, stood near a fire, which they had made, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.

19. Then the high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his doctrine.

20. Jesus answered, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews constantly resort. I said nothing in secret.

21. Why do you examine me? Examine them who heard me teach. They know what I said.

22. When he had spoken thus, one of the officers who attended, gave him a blow, and said, Do you answer the high priest thus?

23. Jesus replied, If I have spoken amiss, show in what the wrong consists: but if well, why do you smite me?

24. Now, Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.

25. As Peter stood warming himself, they asked him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.

26. One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?

27. Peter denied again; and immediately the cock crew.

28. Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium: it was now morning; but the Jews entered not the praetorium, lest they should be defiled, and so not in a condition to eat the passover.

29. Pilate, therefore, went out to them, and said, Of what do you accuse this man?

30. They answered, If he were not a criminal, we would not have delivered him to you.

31. Pilate said, Then take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews replied, We are not permitted to put any man to death.

32. And thus, what Jesus had spoken, signifying what death he should die, was accomplished.

33. Then Pilate returned to the praetorium, and having called Jesus, said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?

35. Pilate replied, Am I am Jew? Your own nation, yes, the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?

36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my adherents would have fought to prevent my falling into the hands of the Jews; but my kingdom is not hence.

37. Then Pilate said, You are a King, then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a King. For this I was born; and for this I came into the world, to give testimony to the truth. Whosoever is of the truth, hearkens to me.

38. Pilate asked him, What is truth? and so saying, went out again to the Jews, and said to them, For my part, I find nothing culpable in this man.

39. But since it is customary that I release to you one at the passover, will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?

40. Then they all cried, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

## John 19

1. Then Pilate caused him to be scourged.

2. And the soldiers crowned him with a wreath of thorn, which they had platted; and having thrown a purple mantle about him,

3. said, Hail! King of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.

4. Pilate went out again, and said to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find in him nothing culpable.

5. Jesus then went forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple mantle, and Pilate said to them, Behold the man!

6. When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for my part, I find no fault in him.

7. The Jews answered, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he assumed the title of the Son of God.

8. When Pilate heard this, he was the more afraid;

9. and having returned to the praetorium, said to Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.

10. Then Pilate said to him, Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and power to release you?

11. Jesus replied, You could have no power over me, unless it were given you from above; wherefore, he who delivered me to you, has greater sin.

12. From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews exclaimed, If you release this man, you are not Cesar's friend. Whoever calls himself king, opposes Cesar.

13. Pilate, on hearing these words, ordered Jesus to be brought forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place named The Pavement; in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. (Now it was the preparation of the Paschal Sabbath, about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, Behold your King.

15. But they cried out, Away, away with him; crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no King but Cesar.

16. He delivered him, therefore, to be crucified.

17. Then they took Jesus, and led him away. And he, carrying his cross, went out to a place called The Place of Skulls, which is, in Hebrew, Golgotha;

18. where they crucified him, and two others with him; one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.

19. Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. The words were, JESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. And many of the Jews read this title, (for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh the city,) and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin:

21. then the chief priests said to Pilate, Write not the King of the Jews; but, Who calls himself King of the Jews.

22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

23. When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his mantle and divided it into four parts, one to every soldier: they also took the coat, which was seamless, woven from the top throughout;

24. «and said, among themselves, Let us not tear it, but determine by lot whose it shall be; by this verifying the scripture, which says,» 'They shared my mantle among them, and cast lots for my vesture.'

25. Thus, therefore, acted the soldiers. Now, there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother, and her sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene.

26. Then Jesus, observing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, said to his mother, Woman, behold your son.

27. Then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own house.

28. After this, Jesus, (knowing that all was now accomplished,) that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.

29. And there was a vessel there full of vinegar, they filled a sponge with vinegar, and, having fastened it to a twig of hyssop, held it to his mouth.

30. When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and bowing his head, yielded up his spirit.

31. The Jews, therefore, lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for it was the preparation, (and that Sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and the bodies might be removed.

32. Accordingly, the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first and of the other, who were crucified with him.

33. But when they came to Jesus, and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

34. But one of the soldiers with a spear, pierced his side, whence blood and water immediately issued.

35. He was an eye-witness, who attests this, and his testimony deserves credit: nay, he is conscious that he speaks truth, that you may believe.

36. «For these things happened that the scripture might be verified,» 'None of his bones shall be broken.'

37. «Again, the scripture elsewhere says,» 'They shall look on him whom they have pierced.'

38. After this, Joseph, the Arimathean, who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed disciple for fear of the Jews, asked permission of Pilate to take away the body of Jesus.

39. Nicodemus also, who had formerly repaired to Jesus by night, came, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.

40. These men took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen rollers, with the spices, which is the Jewish manner of embalming.

41. Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no one had ever yet been laid.

42. There they deposited Jesus, on account of the Jewish preparation, the tomb being near.

## John 20

1. The first day of the week, Mary, the Magdalene, went early to the sepulcher, while it was yet dark; and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.

2. Then she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken the Master out of the sepulcher; and we know not where they have laid him.

3. Immediately Peter went out, and the other disciple, to go to the sepulcher;

4. and both ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulcher;

5. and stooping down, he saw the linen rollers lying, but went not in.

6. Then came Simon Peter, who followed him, and went into the sepulcher, where he observed the rollers lying;

7. and the handkerchief which had been wrapped about his head, not laid beside them, but folded up in a place by itself.

8. Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulcher, entered also; and he saw, and believed the report.

9. For, as yet, they did not understand from the scriptures, that he was to rise from the dead.

10. Then the disciples returned to their companions.

11. But Mary stood without, near the sepulcher, weeping. As she wept, stooping down to look into the sepulcher,

12. she saw two angles in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head, the other at the feet.

13. And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She answered, Because they have taken away my Master, and I know not where they have laid him.

14. Having said this, she turned about, and saw Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus.

15. Jesus aid to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, answered, Sir, if you have conveyed him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.

16. Jesus said to her, Mary. She, turning, said to him, Rabboni; that is, Teacher.

17. Jesus said to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.

18. Mary, the Magdalene, went and informed the disciples, that she had seen the Master, and that he had spoken these things to her.

19. In the evening of that day, the first of the week, Jesus came where the disciples were convened, (the doors having been shut, for the fear of the Jews,) and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you.

20. Having said this, he showed them his hand and his side. The disciples, therefore, rejoiced when they saw it was their Master.

21. Jesus said again to them, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, so do I send you.

22. After these words, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.

23. Whose sins soever you remit, are remitted to them; and whose sins soever you retain, are retained.

24. Now, Thomas, that is, Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them, when Jesus came.

25. The other disciples, therefore, said to him, We have seen the Master. But he answered, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger to the print of the nails, and my hand to his side, I will not believe.

26. Eight days after, the disciples being again in the house, and Thomas with them, Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.

27. Then turning to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, he said, and look at my hands; reach also your hand, and feel my side; and be not incredulous, but believe.

28. Thomas answered, My Lord, and my God!

29. Jesus replied, Because you see me, you believe; happy they, who, having never seen, shall nevertheless believe.

30. Many other miracles Jesus likewise performed in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.

31. But these are recorded, that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and, that believing, you may have life through his name.

## John 21

1. Afterward, Jesus again appeared to the disciples, at the sea of Tiberias; and in this manner he appeared.

2. Simon Peter and Thomas, that is, Didymus, Nathanael of Cana, in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus, being together,

3. Simon Peter said, I am going a-fishing. They answered, We will go with you. Immediately they went, and got aboard a bark, but that night caught nothing.

4. In the morning Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples, however, knew not that it was Jesus.

5. Jesus said to them, My children, have you any victuals? They answered, No.

6. Cast the net, cried he, on the right side of the bark, and you will find. They did so, but were not able to draw it, by reason of the multitude of fishes.

7. Then that disciple whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, It is the Master. Simon Peter, hearing that it was the Master, girt on his upper garment (which was laid aside) and threw himself into the sea.

8. But the other disciples came in the boat, (for they were not farther from land than about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net, with the fishes.

9. When they came ashore, they saw a fire burning, and a fish laid on it, and bread.

10. Jesus said to them, Bring of the fishes which you have now taken.

11. Simon Peter went back, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and the net was not rent, notwithstanding the number.

12. Jesus said to them, Come and dine. Meantime none of the disciples ventured to ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Master.

13. Jesus drew near, and taking bread and fish, distributed among them.

14. This is the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples, after his resurrection.

15. When they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

16. A second time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Tend my sheep.

17. A third time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? Peter, grieved at his asking this question a third time, answered, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Feed my sheep.

18. Most assuredly, I say to you, in your youth you girt yourself, and went whither you would; but in your old age, you shall stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you whither you would not.

19. This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. After these words, he said to him, Follow me.

20. And Peter turning about, saw the disciple, whom Jesus loved, following, (the same who, leaning on his breast at the supper, had asked who it was, that would betray him.)

21. Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, And what, Lord, shall become of this man?

22. Jesus answered, If I will that he wait my return, what is that to you? Follow me.

23. Hence arose the rumor among the brethren, that that disciple should not die; nevertheless, Jesus said not, that he should not die; but, If I will, that he wait my return, what is that to you?

24. It is this disciple, who attests these things, and wrote this account; and we know that his testimony deserves credit.

25. There were many other things also performed by Jesus, which, were they to be severally related, I imagine, the world itself could not contain the volumes that would be written.
