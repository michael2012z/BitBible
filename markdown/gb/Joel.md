2. Hear this, ye 

3. Tell you your children of it, and let your children shew to their children, and their children to another generation.

4. That which is left of ye palmer worme, hath the grashopper eaten, & the residue of ye grashopper hath the canker worme eaten, and the residue of the canker worme hath the caterpiller eaten.

5. Awake, ye 

6. For 

7. He maketh my vine waste, & pilleth off the barke of my figge tree: he maketh it bare, and casteth it downe: ye branches therof are made white.

8. Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the

10. The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: 

11. Be ye ashamed, O husband men: howle, O ye vine dressers for the wheate, and for the barly, because the haruest of the fielde is perished.

12. The vine is dried vp, and the figge tree is decayed: the pomegranate tree & the palme tree, and the apple tree, euen all the trees of the fielde are withered: surely the ioy is withered away from the sonnes of men.

13. 
          

14. Sanctifie you a fast: call a solemne assemblie: gather the Elders, and all the inhabitants of the land into the House of the Lorde your God, and cry vnto the Lord,

15. Alas for the day! for the 

16. Is not the meate cut off before our eyes? & ioy, and gladnesse from the house of our God?

17. The seede is rotten vnder their cloddes: the garners are destroyed: the barnes are broken downe, for the corne is withered.

18. How did the beasts mourne! the herdes of cattel pine away, because they haue no pasture, & the flockes of sheepe are destroyed.

19. O Lord, to thee will I crie: for the fire hath deuoured the pastures of the wildernesse, and the flame hath burnt vp all the trees of the fielde.

20. The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the

5. Like the noyse of charrets in the toppes of the mountaines shal they leape, like the noyse of a flame of fire that deuoureth the stubble, and as a mightie people prepared to the battel.

6. Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces 

7. They shal runne like strong men, and goe vp to the wall like men of warre, and euery man shall goe forward in his wayes, and they shall not stay in their paths.

8. Neither shall one 

9. They shal runne to & fro in the citie: they shal runne vpon the wall: they shal clime vp vpon the houses, & enter in at ye windowes like ye thiefe.

10. The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the 

11. And the LORD shall 

12. Therefore also now the Lord sayth, Turne you vnto me with all your heart, & with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning,

13. And 

14. Who knoweth [if] he will 

15. Blowe the trumpet in Zion, sanctifie a fast, call a solemne assembly.

16. Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the 

17. Let the Priestes, the ministers of the Lord weepe betweene the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and giue not thine heritage into reproche that the heathen should rule ouer them. Wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?

18. Then will the LORD be 

19. Yea, the Lord wil answere and say vnto his people, Beholde, I will send you corne, and wine, and oyle, and you shalbe satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproche among the heathen,

20. But I will remove far off from you the 

21. Feare not, O land, but be glad, and reioyce: for the Lord wil do great things.

22. Be not afrayde, ye beastes of the fielde: for the pastures of the wildernesse are greene: for the tree beareth her fruite: the figge tree & the vine do giue their force.

23. Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain 

24. And the barnes shalbe full of wheate, and the presses shal abound with wine and oyle.

25. And I will render you the yeeres that the grashopper hath eaten, the canker worme and the caterpiller and the palmer worme, my great hoste which I sent among you.

26. So you shal eate and be satisfied and praise the Name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt marueilously with you: and my people shal neuer be ashamed.

27. Ye shal also know, that I am in the middes of Israel, and that I am the Lorde your God and none other, & my people shal neuer be ashamed.

28. And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour 

29. And also vpon the seruants, and vpon the maydes in those dayes wil I powre my Spirit.

7. Beholde, I will rayse them out of the place where ye haue sold them, and will render your reward vpon your owne head,

9. Publish this among the Gentiles: prepare warre, wake vp the mightie men: let all the men of warre drawe neere and come vp.

10. 
          

11. Assemble your selues, and come all yee heathen and gather your selues together round about: there shall the Lord cast downe the mightie men.

12. Let the heathen be wakened, and come vp to the valley of Iehoshaphat: for there will I sit to iudge all the heathen round about.
