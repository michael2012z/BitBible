5. And 

6. Then shall he fley the burnt offering, and cut it in pieces.

7. So the sonnes of Aaron the Priest shall put fire vpon the altar, and lay the wood in order vpon the fire.

8. Then the Priestes Aarons sonnes shall lay the parts in order, the head & the kall vpon the wood that is in the fire which is vpon the altar.

9. But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour 

10. And if his sacrifice for the burnt offering be of the flocks (as of the sheepe, or of the goats) he shall offer a male without blemish,

11. 
          

12. And he shall cut it in pieces, separating his head and his kall, and the Priest shall lay them in order vpon the wood that lyeth in the fire which is on the altar:

13. But he shall wash the inwardes, and the legges with water, and the Priest shall offer the whole & burne it vpon the altar: for it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.

9. And the Priest shall take from the meate offring a memoriall of it, and shall burne it vpon the altar: for it is an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord.

10. But that which is left of the meate offring, shalbe Aarons and his sonnes: for it is most holy of the offrings of the Lorde made by fire.

11. All the meate offrings which ye shall offer vnto the Lorde, shalbe made without leauen: for ye shall neither burne leauen nor honie in any offring of the Lorde made by fire.

16. And the Priest shall burne the memoriall of it, euen of that that is beaten, and of the oyle of it, with all the incense thereof: for it is an offring vnto the Lorde made by fire.

10. As it was taken away from the bullock of the peace offrings, & the Priest shall burne them vpon the altar of burnt offring.

11. But the skinne of the bullocke, and all his flesh, with his heade, and his legs, and his inwardes, and his dung shal he beare out.

12. So he shall cary the whole bullocke out of the host vnto a cleane place, where the ashes are powred, & shall burne him on ye wood in the fire: where ye ashes are cast out, shal he be burnt.

13. And if the

17. And the Priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seuen times before the Lord, euen before the vaile.

18. Also he shall put some of ye blood vpon the hornes of the altar, which is before the Lord, that is in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: then shall he powre all the rest, of the blood at ye foote of the altar of burnt offring, which is at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,

19. And he shall take all his fat from him, and burne it vpon the altar.

20. And the Priest shal doe with this bullocke, as he did with the bullocke for his sinne: so shall he do with this: so the Priest shal make an atonement for them, and it shalbe forgiuen them.

21. For he shal carie the bullocke without the hoste, and burne him as he burned the first bullock: for it is an offring for the sinne of the Congregation.

22. When a ruler shal sinne, and do through ignorance against any of the commaundementes of the Lorde his God, which should not be done, and shall offend,

23. If one shewe vnto him his sinne, which he hath committed, the shall he bring for his offring an hee goat without blemish,

7. But if he be not able to bring a sheepe, he shall bring for his trespas which he hath committed, two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons vnto the Lord, one for a sinne offring, and the other for a burnt offring.

8. So he shall bring them vnto the Priest, who shall offer the sinne offring first, and wring the necke of it a sunder, but not plucke it cleane off.

9. After he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sinne offring vpon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be shed at the foote of the altar: for it is a sinne offering.

10. And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall

13. So the Priest shal make an atonement for him, as touching his sinne that he hath committed in one of these poyntes, and it shall bee forgiuen him: and the remnant shalbe the Priests, as the meate offring.

14. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

15. If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, 

16. So hee shall restore that wherein hee hath offended, in taking away of the holy thing, and shall put the fift part more thereto, and giue it vnto the Priest: so the Priest shal make an atonement for him with the ram of ye trespasse offring, and it shalbe forgiuen him.

17. And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist [it] not, yet is he guilty, and shall

## Leviticus 6

1. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in 

3. Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, 

4. When, I say, he thus sinneth & trespasseth, he shall then restore the robbery that he robbed, or the thing taken by violence which hee tooke by force, or the thing which was deliuered him to keepe, or the lost thing which he founde,

5. Or for whatsoeuer he hath sworne falsely, he shall both restore it in the whole summe, and shall adde the fift parte more thereto, and giue it vnto him to whome perteyneth, the same day that he offreth for trespasse.

6. Also he shall bring for his trespasse vnto the Lorde, a ramme without blemish out of the flocke in thy estimation worth two shekels for a trespasse offring vnto the Priest.

7. And the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lorde, and it shall be forgiuen him, whatsoeuer thing he hath done, and trespassed therein.

8. Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This [is] the 

10. And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon 

11. After, he shal put off his garments, and put on other raiment, and cary the ashes foorth without the hoste vnto a cleane place.

12. But the fire vpon the altar shall burne thereon and neuer be put out: wherefore the Priest shall burne wood on it euery morning, and lay the burnt offering in order vpon it, and he shall burne thereon the fat of the peace offrings.

13. The fire shall euer burne vpon the altar, and neuer go out.

14. Also this is the lawe of the meate offring, which Aarons sonnes shall offer in the presence of the Lorde, before the altar.

15. He shall euen take thence his handfull of fine flowre of the meate offring and of the oyle, & all the incense which is vpon the meat offring, and shall burne it vpon the altar for a sweete sauour, as a memoriall therefore vnto the Lorde:

16. But the rest thereof shall Aaron and his sonnes eate: it shalbe eaten without leauen in the holy place: in the court of the Tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eate it.

17. It shall not be 

18. All the males among the children of Aaron shall eate of it: It shalbe a statute for euer in your generations concerning the offrings of the Lord, made by fire: whatsoeuer toucheth them shall be holy.

19. Agayne the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,

20. This [is] the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering 

21. In the frying panne it shalbe made with oyle: thou shalt bring it fryed, and shalt offer the baken pieces of the meate offering for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.

22. And the priest of his sons that is 

23. For euery meate offring of the Priest shall be burnt altogether, it shall not be eaten.

24. Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

25. Speake vnto Aaron, and vnto his sonnes, and say, This is the Lawe of the sinne offering, In the place where the burnt offring is killed, shall the sinne offring be killed before the Lord, for it is most holy.

26. The Priest that offreth this sinne offring, shall eate it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of ye Tabernacle of the Congregation.

27. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any

30. And no sin offering, whereof [any] of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile [withal] in the holy [place], shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the

6. All the males among the Priestes shall eate thereof, it shalbe eaten in the holy place, for it is most holy.

7. As the sin offering [is], so [is] the trespass offering: [there is] one 

8. Also the Priest that offereth any mans burnt offring, shall haue the skinne of the burnt offring which he hath offered.

9. And all the meate offring that is baken in the ouen, and that is dressed in the pan, and in the frying pan, shall be the Priestes that offereth it.

10. And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and

12. If he offer it for a

14. And of all the sacrifice he shall offer one cake for an heaue offering vnto the Lorde, and it shalbe the Priestes that sprinckleth the blood of the peace offrings.

15. Also the flesh of his peace offerings, for thankesgiuing, shalbe eaten the same day that it is offered: he shall leaue nothing thereof vntill the morning.

16. But if the sacrifice of his offering [be] a 

17. But as much of the offered flesh as remaineth vnto the third day, shalbe burnt with fire.

18. And if [any] of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall 

19. And the flesh that toucheth any unclean 

20. But if any eate of the flesh of the peace offerings that pertaineth to the Lorde, hauing his vncleannesse vpon him, euen the same person shalbe cut off from his people.

21. Moreouer, whe any toucheth any vncleane thing, as the vncleannesse of man, or of an vncleane beast, or of any filthie abomination, and eate of the flesh of the peace offrings, which pertaineth vnto the Lorde, euen that person shalbe cut off from his people.

22. Againe ye Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

23. Speake vnto the children of Israel, & say, Ye shall eate no fat of beeues, nor of sheepe, nor of goates:

24. Yet the fat of the dead beast, and the fat of that, which is torne with beastes, shalbe occupied to any vse, but ye shall not eate of it.

25. For whosoeuer eateth the fat of the beast, of the which he shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lorde, euen the person that eateth, shalbe cut off from his people.

26. Neither shall ye eate any blood, either of foule, or of beast in all your dwellings.

27. Euery person that eateth any blood, euen the same person shall be cut off from his people.

28. And the Lord talked with Moses, saying,

29. Speake vnto the children of Israel, & say, Hee that offereth his peace offerings vnto the Lorde, shall bring his gifte vnto the Lorde of his peace offerings:

30. His own 

31. Then the Priest shall burne the fatte vpon the Altar, and the breast shall be Aarons and his sonnes.

32. And the right shoulder shall ye giue vnto the Priest for an heaue offering, of your peace offrings.

33. The same that offreth the blood of ye peace offrings, and the fatte, among the sonnes of Aaron, shall haue the right shoulder for his parte.

34. For the breast shaken to and fro, and the shoulder lifted vp, haue I taken of the children of Israel, euen of their peace offrings, and haue giuen them vnto Aaron the Priest and vnto his sonnes by a statute for euer from among the children of Israel.

35. This [is the portion] of the 

36. The which portions the Lorde commanded to giue them in the day that he anointed them from among the children of Israel, by a statute for euer in their generations.

37. This [is] the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the 

38. Which the Lorde commaunded Moses in the mount Sinai, when he commanded the children of Israel to offer their giftes vnto the Lorde in the wildernesse of Sinai.

## Leviticus 8

1. Afterwarde the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. Take Aaron and his sonnes with him, and the garments and the anointing oyle, and a bullocke for the sinne offring, & two rammes, and a basket of vnleauened bread,

3. And assemble all the company at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

4. So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him, & the companie was assembled at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

5. Then Moses said vnto the company, This is the thing which the Lorde hath commaunded to doe.

6. And Moses brought Aaron and his sonnes, and washed them with water,

7. And put vpon him the coate, and girded him with a girdle, & clothed him with the robe, and put the Ephod on him, which he girded with the broydred garde of the Ephod, and bounde it vnto him therewith.

8. After he put the brest plate thereon, and put in the breast plate the Vrim and the Thummim.

9. And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, [even] upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the 

10. And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the 

11. And sprinkled thereof vpon the altar seuen times, and anointed the altar and all his instruments, and the lauer, and his foote, to sanctifie them)

12. And he powred of the anointing oyle vpon Aarons head, and anointed him, to sanctifie him.

13. After, Moses brought Aarons sonnes, and put coates vpon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonets vpon their heades, as the Lorde had commanded Moses.

14. Then he brought the bullocke for the sinne offring, and Aaron and his sonnes put their handes vpon the head of the bullocke for the sinne offring.

15. And he slew [it]; and Moses took the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the 

16. Then he tooke all the fatte that was vpon the inwardes, and the kall of the liuer and the two kidneis, with their fat, which Moses burned vpon the Altar.

17. But the bullock, and his 

18. Also hee brought the ram for the burnt offring, and Aaron and his sonnes put their hands vpon the head of the ramme.

19. So Moses killed it, and sprinkled the blood vpon the Altar round about,

20. And Moses cut the ram in pieces, & burnt the head with the pieces, and the fat,

21. And washed the inwardes and the legges in water: so Moses burnt the ram euery whit vpon ye Altar: for it was a burnt offring for a sweete sauour, which was made by fire vnto the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

22. After, he brought the other ram, the ram of consecrations, and Aaron and his sonnes layed their handes vpon the head of the ram,

23. And he 

24. Then Moses brought Aarons sonnes, and put of the blood on the lap of their right eares, and vpon the thumbes of their right handes, and vpon the great toes of their right feete, and Moses sprinckled the rest of the blood vpon the Altar round about.

25. And he tooke the fat & the rumpe and all the fat that was vpon the inwards, and the kall of the liuer, and the two kidneis with their fat, & the right shoulder.

26. Also he tooke of ye basket of ye vnleauened bread that was before the Lorde, one vnleauened cake and a cake of oiled bread, & one wafer, and put them on the fat, & vpon the right shoulder.

27. So hee put all in Aarons handes, and in his sonnes handes, and shooke it to and fro before the Lord.

28. After, Moses tooke the out of their hands, & burnt them vpon the altar for a burnt offring: for these were consecrations for a sweete sauour which were made by fire vnto the Lord.

29. Likewise Moses tooke the breast of the ram of consecrations, & shooke it to and fro before the Lord: for it was Moses portion, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

30. Also Moses tooke of the anointing oyle, and of the blood which was vpon the Altar, and sprinkled it vpon Aaron, vpon his garments, and vpon his sonnes, and on his sonnes garments with him: so hee sanctified Aaron, his garments, & his sonnes, and his sonnes garments with him.

31. And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh [at] the door of the 

32. But that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread, shall ye burne with fire.

33. And ye shall not depart from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen dayes, vntill the dayes of your consecrations bee at an ende: for seuen dayes, saide the Lorde, shall hee consecrate you,

34. As hee hath done this day: so the Lorde hath commanded to doe, to make an atonement for you.

35. Therefore shall yee abide at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation day and night, seuen dayes, and shall keepe the watch of the Lord, that ye dye not: for so I am commanded.

36. So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the

4. Also a bullock, and a ramme for peace offringes, to offer before the Lorde, and a meate offring mingled with oyle: for to day the Lorde will appeare vnto you.

5. And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the 

6. (For Moses had sayde, This is the thing, which the Lord commaunded that ye should do, and the glory of the Lord shal appeare vnto you)

7. And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for 

8. Aaron therefore went vnto the Altar, and killed the calfe of the sinne offring, which was for himselfe.

9. And the sonnes of Aaron brought ye blood vnto him, and he dipt his finger in the blood, and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar, and powred the rest of the blood at the foote of the Altar.

10. But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he 

11. The flesh also and the hide hee burnt with fire without the hoste.

12. After, he slewe the burnt offering, and Aarons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinckled round about vpon the Altar.

13. Also they brought the burnt offring vnto him with the pieces thereof, and the head, and he burnt them vpon the Altar.

14. And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and 

15. Then he offred the peoples offring, and tooke a goate, which was the sinne offring for the people, and slewe it: and offred it for sinne, as the first:

16. So he offred the burnt offring, and prepared it, according to the maner.

17. He presented also the meate offring, & filled his hand thereof, and beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning he burnt this vpon the Altar.

18. He slewe also the bullock, and the ram for the peace offrings, that was for the people, and Arons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinkled vpon the Altar round about,

19. With the fat of the bullocke, and of the ram, the rumpe, and that which couereth the inwards and the kidneis, and the kall of the liuer.

20. So they layed the fat vpon the breasts, and he burnt the fat vpon the Altar.

23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and 

24. And there came a fire out from the Lord and consumed vpon the Altar the burnt offring and the fatte: which when all the people sawe, they gaue thankes, and fell on their faces.

## Leviticus 10

1. And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered 

2. Therefore a fire went out from the Lord, & deuoured them: so they dyed before the Lord.

3. Then Moses said unto Aaron, This [is it] that the LORD spake, saying, I will be 

4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Vzziel, the vncle of Aaron, & saide vnto them, Come neere, cary your brethre from before the Sanctuarie out of the hoste.

5. Then they went, and caried them in their coates out of the host, as Moses had comaunded.

6. And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, 

7. And go not yee out from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, least ye dye: for the anointing oyle of the Lorde is vpon you: and they did according to Moses commaundement.

8. And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron, saying,

9. Thou shalt not drinke wine nor strong drinke, thou, nor thy sonnes with thee, when yee come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest ye die: this is an ordinance for euer throughout your generations,

10. That ye may put difference betweene the holy and the vnholy, and betweene the cleane and the vncleane,

11. And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lorde hath commaunded them by the hand of Moses.

12. Then Moses saide vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar and to Ithamar his sonnes that were left, Take the meate offring that remaineth of the offrings of the Lorde, made by fire, and eate it without leauen beside ye altar: for it is most holy:

13. And ye shall eate it in the holy place, because it is thy duetie and thy sonnes duety of the offringes of the Lorde made by fire: for so I am commannded.

14. And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy 

15. The heaue shoulder, and the shaken breast shall they bring with the offringes made by fire of the fat, to shake it to and fro before the Lord, and it shalbe thine and thy sonnes with thee by a lawe for euer, as the Lord hath commaunded.

16. And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron [which were] 

17. Wherfore haue ye not eaten the sinne offring in the holy place, seeing it is most Holie? & God hath giuen it you, to beare the iniquitie of the Congregation, to make an atonement for them before the Lorde.

18. Beholde, the blood of it was not brought within the holy place: ye should haue eaten it in the holy place, as I commaunded.

19. And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day 

20. And when Moses heard [that], he was

1. After, the Lord spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying vnto them,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These [are] the beasts which ye 

3. Whatsoever parteth the 

4. But of them that chewe the cud, or deuide the hoofe onely, of them yee shall not eate: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, & deuideth not ye hoofe, he shall be vncleane vnto you.

5. Likewise the conie, because he cheweth the cud and deuideth not the hoofe, he shall bee vncleane to you.

6. Also the hare, because he cheweth the cud, and deuideth not the hoofe, he shalbe vncleane to you.

7. And the swine, because he parteth ye hoofe and is clouen footed, but cheweth not the cud, he shalbe vncleane to you.

8. Of their 

9. These shall ye eate, of all that are in the waters: whatsoeuer hath finnes & skales in ye waters, in the seas, or in the riuers, them shal ye eate.

10. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that 

11. They, I say, shalbe an abomination to you: ye shall not eate of their flesh, but shall abhorre their carkeis.

12. Whatsoeuer hath not fins nor skales in the waters, that shalbe abomination vnto you.

13. These shal ye haue also in abomination among the foules, they shal not be eaten: for they are an abomination, the egle, and the goshauke, and the osprey:

14. Also the vultur, & the kite after his kinde,

15. And all rauens after their kinde:

16. The ostrich also, and the night crowe, and the seameaw, and the hauke after his kinde:

17. The litle owle also, and the connorant, and the great owle.

18. Also the redshanke and the pelicane, and the swanne:

19. The storke also, the heron after his kinde, and the lapwing, and the backe:

20. Also euery foule that creepeth & goeth vpon all foure, such shalbe an abomination vnto you.

21. Yet these shal ye eate: of euery foule that creepeth, and goeth vpon all foure which haue their feete and legs all of one to leape withal vpon the earth,

22. [Even] these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the 

23. But al other foules that creepe & haue foure feete, they shalbe abomination vnto you.

24. For by such ye shalbe polluted: whosoeuer toucheth their carkeis, shalbe vncleane vnto the euening.

25. And whosoever 

26. Euery beast that hath clawes deuided, and is not clouen footed, nor cheweth the cud, such shalbe vncleane vnto you: euery one that toucheth them, shalbe vncleane.

27. And whatsoeuer goeth vpon his pawes among all maner beastes that goeth on all foure, such shalbe vncleane vnto you: who so doth touch their carkeis shalbe vncleane vntil the euen.

28. And he that beareth their carkeis, shal wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntill the euen: for such shalbe vncleane vnto you.

29. These also [shall be] unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the 

30. Also the rat, and the lizard, and the chameleon, and the stellio, and the molle.

31. These shall be vncleane to you among all that creepe: whosoeuer doeth touch them when they be dead, shalbe vncleane vntil the euen.

32. And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether [it be] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or 

33. But euery earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoeuer is within it shalbe vncleane, and ye shal breake it.

34. Al meate also that shalbe eaten, if any such water come vpon it, shalbe vncleane: & all drinke that shalbe drunke in al such vessels shalbe vncleane.

35. And euery thing that their carkeis fall vpon, shalbe vncleane: the fornais or the pot shalbe broken: for they are vncleane, & shalbe vncleane vnto you.

36. Nevertheless a fountain or pit, [wherein there is] plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which 

37. And if there fal of their dead carkeis vpo any seede, which vseth to be sowe, it shalbe cleane.

38. But if [any] 

39. If also any beast, whereof ye may eate, die, he that toucheth the carkeis thereof shal be vncleane vntil the euen.

40. And he that eateth of the carkeis of it, shal wash his clothes and be vncleane vntil the euen: he also that beareth the carkeis of it, shal wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntil the euen.

41. Euery creeping thing therefore that creepeth vpon the earth shalbe an abomination, and not be eaten.

42. Whatsoeuer goeth vpon the breast, and whatsoeuer goeth vpon al foure, or that hath many feete among all creeping thinges that creepe vpon the earth, ye shal not eate of them, for they shalbe abomination.

43. Ye shall not pollute your selues with any thing that creepeth, neither make your selues vncleane with them, neither defile your selues thereby: ye shal not, I say, be defiled by them,

44. For I [am] the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be 

45. For I am the Lorde that brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to be your God, and that you should be holy, for I am holy.

46. This is the law of beasts, and of foules, and of euery liuing thing that moueth in the waters, and of euery thing that creepeth vpon the earth:

47. That there may be a difference betweene the vncleane and cleane, and betweene the beast that may be eaten, and the beast that ought not to be eaten.

8. But if she bee not able to bring a lambe, she shall bring two turtles, or two yong pigeons: the one for a burnt offring, and the other for a sinne offring: and the Priest shall make an atonement for her: so she shal be cleane.

## Leviticus 13

1. Moreouer the Lorde spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, saying,

2. When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh 

3. And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and [when] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight [be] 

4. But if the white spot be in the skinne of his flesh, and seeme not to bee lower then the skin, nor the heare thereof be turned vnto white, then the Priest shall shut vp him that hath the plague, seuen dayes.

5. After, the Priest shall looke vpon him the seuenth day: and if the plague seeme to him to abide still, and the plague growe not in the skin, the Priest shal shut him vp yet seuen dayes more.

6. And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, [if] the plague [be] somewhat 

7. But if the skab growe more in the skinne, after that he is seene of ye Priest for to be purged, he shall be seene of the Priest yet againe.

8. And [if] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him 

9. When the plague of leprosie is in a man, he shalbe brought vnto the Priest,

10. And the Priest shall see him: and if the swelling be white in ye skin, & haue made ye heare white, and there be rawe flesh in the swelling,

11. It is an old leprosie in the skin of his flesh: and the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane, and shall not shut him vp, for he is vncleane.

12. Also if the leprosie breake out in the skin, and the leprosie couer all the skin of the plague, from his head euen to his feete, wheresoeuer the Priest looketh,

13. Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, [if] the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] 

14. But if there be raw flesh on him when he is seene, he shalbe vncleane.

15. And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: [for] the raw flesh [is] 

16. Or if the rawe flesh change and be turned into white, then he shall come to the Priest,

17. And the Priest shal beholde him and if the sore be changed into white, then the Priest shall pronounce the plague cleane, for it is cleane.

18. The flesh also in whose skin there is a bile and is healed,

19. And in ye place of the bile there be a white swelling, or a white spot somewhat reddish, it shal be seene of the Priest.

20. And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it [be] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him 

21. But if the Priest looke on it, & there be no white heares therein, and if it bee not lower then the skin, but be darker, then the Priest shall shut him vp seuen dayes.

22. And if it spred abroad in the flesh, ye Priest shall pronounce him vncleane, for it is a sore.

23. But if the spot continue in his place, and growe not, it is a burning bile: therefore the Priest shall declare him to be cleane.

24. Or if there be [any] flesh, in the skin whereof [there is] a hot burning, and the quick [flesh] that burneth have a 

25. Then the Priest shall looke vpon it: and if the heare in that spot be changed into white, and it appeare lower then the skin, it is a leprosie broken out in the burning therefore the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane: for it is the plague of leprosie.

26. But if the Priest looke on it, and there be no white heare in the spot, and be no lower then the other skinne, but be darker, then the Priest shall shut him vp seuen dayes.

27. After, the Priest shall looke on him the seuenth day: if it be growen abroad in the skinne, then the Priest shall pronounce him vncleane: for it is the plague of leprosie.

28. And if the spot abide in his place, not growing in the skin, but is darke, it is a rising of the burning: the Priest shall therefore declare him cleane, for it is the drying vp of the burning.

29. If also a man or woman hath a sore on the head or in the beard,

30. Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it [be] in sight deeper than the skin; [and there be] in it a yellow thin 

31. And if the Priest looke on the sore of the blacke spotte, and if it seeme not lower then the skinne, nor haue any blacke heare in it, then the Priest shall shut vp him, that hath the sore of the blacke spot, seuen dayes.

32. After, in the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the sore: and if the blacke spot growe not, and there be in it no yelowe heare, and the blacke spot seeme not lower then the skinne,

33. Then he shalbe shauen, but the place of the blacke spot shall he not shaue: but the Priest shall shut vp him, that hath the blacke spot, seuen dayes more.

34. And the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the blacke spot: and if the blacke spot growe not in the skinne, nor seeme lower then the other skinne, then the Priest shall clense him, and hee shall wash his clothes, and be cleane.

35. But if the blacke spot growe abroad in the flesh after his clensing,

36. Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not 

37. But if ye blacke spot seeme to him to abide, and that blacke heare growe therein, the blacke spot is healed, he is cleane, and the Priest shall declare him to be cleane.

38. Furthermore if there bee many white spots in the skin of the flesh of man or woman,

39. Then the Priest shall consider: and if the spots in the skin of their flesh be somewhat darke and white withall, it is but a white spot broken out in the skin: therefore he is cleane.

40. And the man whose heare is fallen off his head, and is balde, is cleane.

41. And he that hath his 

42. But if there be in the balde head, or in the balde forehead a white reddish sore, it is a leprosie springing in his balde head, or in his balde forehead.

43. Therefore the Priest shall looke vpon it, & if the rising of the sore bee white reddish in his balde head, or in his bald forehead, appearing like leprosie in the skin of the flesh,

44. He is a leper and vncleane: therefore the Priest shall pronounce him altogether vncleane: for the sore is in his head.

45. And the leper in whom the plague [is], his clothes shall be 

46. As long as the disease shall be vpon him, he shalbe polluted, for he is vncleane: he shall dwell alone, without the campe shall his habitation be.

47. Also the garment that the plague of leprosie is in, whether it be a wollen garment or a linen garment,

48. Whether it bee in the warpe or in ye woofe of linen or of wollen, either in a skin, or in any thing made of skin,

49. And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of 

50. Then the Priest shall see the plague, and shut vp it that hath the plague, seuen dayes,

51. And shall looke on the plague the seuenth day: if the plague growe in the garment or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in the skinne, or in any thing that is made of skin, that plague is a fretting leprosie and vncleane.

52. And hee shall burne the garment, or the warpe, or the woofe, whether it bee wollen or linen, or any thing that is made of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a freating leprosie, therefore it shalbe burnt in the fire.

53. And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not 

54. Then the Priest shall commaunde them to wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it vp seuen dayes more.

55. And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, [if] the plague have not changed his 

56. And if the Priest see that the plague bee darker, after that it is washed, he shall cut it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warpe, or out of the woofe.

57. And if it appeare stil in ye garment or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thing made of skin, it is a spreading leprie: thou shalt burne the thing wherein the plague is, in the fire.

58. And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin [it be], which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed 

59. This is the lawe of the plague of leprosie in a garment of wollen or linnen, or in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thing of skin, to make it cleane or vncleane.

## Leviticus 14

1. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. This shall be the 

3. And the Priest shall go out of the campe, & the Priest shall consider him: and if the plague of leprosie be healed in the leper,

4. Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive [and] 

5. And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over 

6. After, he shall take the liue sparowe with the cedar wood, and the skarlet lace, and the hyssope, and shall dip them and the liuing sparowe in the blood of the sparowe slaine, ouer the pure water,

7. And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall 

8. Then he that shall be clensed, shall wash his clothes, and shaue off all his heare, and wash himselfe in water, so he shalbe cleane: after that shall he come into the host, but shall tary without his tent seuen dayes.

9. So in the seuenth day hee shall shaue off all his heare, both his head, and his beard, and his eye browes: euen all his heare shall he shaue, and shall wash his clothes and shall wash his flesh in water: so he shalbe cleane.

10. And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without 

11. And the Priest that maketh him cleane shal bring the man which is to bee made cleane, and those things, before the Lord, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

12. Then the Priest shall take one lambe, and offer him for a trespasse offering, and the pint of oyle, and shake the to and fro before the Lord.

13. And hee shall kill the lambe in the place where the sinne offring and the burnt offring are slaine, euen in the holy place: for as the sinne offring is the Priests, so is the trespasse offring: for it is most holy.

14. So the Priest shal take of the blood of the trespasse offring, and put it vpon the lappe of the right eare of him that shalbe clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hand, and vpon the great toe of his right foote.

15. The Priest shall also take of ye pint of oyle, and powre it into the palme of his left hand,

16. And the Priest shal dip his right finger in the oyle that is in his left hand, & sprinkle of the oyle with his finger seuen times before the Lord.

17. And of the rest of the oyle that is in his hand, shal the Priest put vpon the lap of the right eare of him that is to bee clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hand, and vpon the great toe of his right foote, where the blood of the trespasse offring was put.

18. But the remnant of the oyle that is in the Priests hand, he shal powre vpon the head of him that is to be clensed: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord.

19. And the Priest shal offer the sinne offring and make an atonement for him that is to bee clensed of his vncleannesse: then after shall he kill the burnt offring.

20. So the Priest shal offer ye burnt offring and the meat offring vpon ye altar and the Priest shall make an atonement for him: so he shalbe cleane.

21. And if he [be] poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb [for] a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one 

22. Also two turtle doues, or two yong pigeons, as he is able, whereof the one shalbe a sinne offering, and the other a burnt offring,

23. And he shall bring them the eight day for his clensing vnto the Priest at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before ye Lord.

24. And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall 

25. And he shall kil the lambe of the trespasse offering, and the Priest shall take of the blood of the trespasse offring, and put it vpon the lap of his right eare that is to be clensed, & vpon ye thumbe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his right foote.

26. Also the Priest shal powre of the oyle into the palme of his owne left hand.

27. So ye Priest shal with his right finger sprinkle of the oyle that is in his left hand, seuen times before the Lord.

28. Then the Priest shall put of the oyle that is in his hande, vpon the lap of the right eare of him that is to bee clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his right foote: vpon the place of the blood of the trespasse offring.

29. But ye rest of the oyle that is in the Priests hand, he shall put vpon the head of him that is to be clensed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.

30. And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, 

31. Such, I say, as he is able, the one for a sinne offring, and the other for a burnt offring with the meate offring: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him that is to bee clensed before the Lord.

32. This [is] the 

33. The Lord also spake vnto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

34. When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I 

35. Then he that oweth the house, shall come and tell the Priest, saying, Me thinke there is like a plague of leprosie in the house.

36. Then the Priest shall commande them to emptie the house before the Priest goe into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made vncleane, and then shall the Priest goe in to see the house,

37. And hee shall marke the plague: and if the plague be in the walles of the house, & that there be deepe spots, greenish or reddish, which seeme to be lower then the wall,

38. Then the Priest shall goe out of the house to the doore of the house, and shall cause to shut vp the house seuen dayes.

39. So the Priest shall come againe ye seuenth day: and if he see that the plague bee increased in the walles of the house,

40. Then the Priest shall commande them to take away the stones wherein the plague is, and they shall cast them into a foule place without the citie.

41. And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into 

42. And they shall take other stones, and put them in the places of those stones, and shall take other mortar, to plaister the house with.

43. But if the plague come againe and breake out in the house, after that he hath taken away ye stones, and after that hee hath scraped and playstered the house,

44. Then the Priest shall come and see: and if the plague growe in the house, it is a freating leprosie in the house: it is therefore vncleane.

45. And he shall 

46. Moreouer he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut vp, hee shall bee vncleane vntill the euen.

47. Hee also that sleepeth in the house shall wash his clothes: he likewise that eateth in the house, shall wash his clothes.

48. But if the Priest shall come and see, that the plague hath spread no further in the house, after the house be plaistered, the Priest shall pronounce that house cleane, for the plague is healed.

49. And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and 

50. And hee shall kill one sparowe ouer pure water in an earthen vessell,

51. And shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssope, and the skarlet lace with the liue sparow, and dip them in the blood of the slayne sparow, and in the pure water, and sprinkle the house seuen times:

52. So shall hee clense the house with ye blood of the sparowe, & with the pure water, and with the liue sparowe, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssope, and with the skarlet lace.

53. Afterwarde he shal let go the liue sparowe out of the towne into the broad fieldes: so shal he make atonement for the house, and it shal be cleane.

54. This is the law for euery plague of leprosie and blacke spot,

55. And of the leprosie of the garment, and of the house,

56. And of the swelling, and of the skab, and of the white spot.

57. This is the lawe of the leprosie to teache when a thing is vncleane, & when it is cleane.

## Leviticus 15

1. Moreouer the Lord spake vnto Moses, and to Aaron, saying,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his 

3. And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it [is] 

4. Euery bed whereon he lyeth that hath the issue, shall be vncleane, and euery thing whereon he sitteth, shalbe vncleane.

5. Whosoeuer also toucheth his bed, shal wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shall be vncleane vntill the euen.

6. And he that sitteth on any thing, whereon he sate that hath the issue, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vntill the euen.

7. Also he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue, shal wash his clothes, & wash himselfe in water, & shalbe vncleane vntil the euen.

8. And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then 

9. And what 

10. And whosoeuer toucheth any thing that was vnder him, shall be vncleane vnto the euen: and he that beareth those things, shall wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and shall be vncleane vntill the euen.

11. Likewise whomesoeuer hee toucheth that hath the issue (and hath not washed his handes in water) shal wash his clothes and wash himselfe in water, and shalbe vncleane vntill the euen.

12. And the vessel of earth that he toucheth, which hath the issue, shalbe broken: and euery vessel of wood shalbe rinsed in water.

13. And when he that hath an issue is 

14. Then the eight day he shall take vnto him two Turtle doues or two yong pigeons, and come before the Lorde at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall giue them vnto the Priest.

4. He shal put on the holy linnen coate, and shal haue linnen breeches vpon his flesh, & shal be girded with a linnen girdle, and shal couer his head with a linnen miter: these are the holy garments: therefore shal hee wash his flesh in water, when he doeth put them on.

5. And hee shal take of the Congregation of the children of Israel, two hee goates for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring.

6. Then Aaron shal offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for his house.

7. And he shal take the two hee goates, and present them before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

8. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the 

9. And Aaron shal offer the goat, vpon which the Lords lot shal fal, & make him a sinne offring.

10. But the goate, on which the lot shal fall to be the Scape goate, shalbe presented aliue before the Lord, to make reconciliation by him, & to let him go (as a Scape goate) into the wildernes.

11. Thus Aaron shal offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make a reconciliation for himselfe, and for his house, and shal kill the bullocke for his sinne offring.

12. And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring [it] within the

14. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle [it] with his finger upon the mercy seat 

15. Then shall he kill the goate that is the peoples sinne offring, and bring his blood within the vaile, and doe with that blood, as he did with the blood of the bullocke, and sprinckle it vpon the Merciseate, and before the Merciseate.

16. And he shall make an atonement for the holy [place], because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that 

17. And there shalbe no man in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, when he goeth in to make an atonement in the Holy place, vntill hee come out, and haue made an atonement for himselfe, and for his housholde, and for all the Congregation of Israel.

18. And he shall go out unto the 

19. So shal hee sprinkle of the blood vpon it with his finger seuen times, & clense it, & halowe it from the vncleannes of the children of Israel.

20. When he hath made an ende of purging the Holy place, and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the altar, then he shall bring the liue goate:

21. And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them 

22. So the goate shal beare vpon him all their iniquities into the land that is not inhabited, & he shal let the goate go into the wildernesse.

23. After, Aaron shal come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and put off the linnen clothes, which he put on when he went into the Holy place, and leaue them there.

24. And he shall wash his flesh with water in 

25. Also the fatte of the sinne offring shal he burne vpon the altar.

26. And he that caried forth the goat, called the Scape goat, shal wash his clothes, & wash his flesh in water, and after that shal come into the hoste.

27. Also the bullocke for the sinne offring, & the goate for the sinne offring (whose blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the Holy place) shal one carie out without the hoste to be burnt in the fire, with their skinnes, and with their flesh, and with their doung.

28. And hee that burneth them shal wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and afterward come into the hoste.

29. And [this] shall be a statute for ever unto you: [that] in the 

30. For that day shal ye Priest make an atonement for you to clense you: ye shalbe cleane from all your sinnes before the Lord.

31. It [shall be] a 

32. And the priest, 

33. And shal purge the Holy Sanctuarie & the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shal clense the altar, and make an atonement for the Priests and for all the people of the Congregation.

34. And this shalbe an euerlasting ordinance vnto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sinnes once a yeere: and as the Lord commanded Moses, he did.

5. To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the

10. And whatsoever man [there be] of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set 

11. For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I haue giuen it vnto you to offer vpon the altar, to make an atonemet for your soules: for this blood shall make an atonement for the soule.

12. Therefore I saide vnto ye children of Israel, None of you shall eate blood: neither the stranger that soiourneth among you, shall eate blood.

13. And whatsoever man [there be] of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be 

14. For ye life of all flesh is his blood, it is ioyned with his life: therefore I sayd vnto the children of Israel, Ye shall eate the blood of no flesh: for the life of al flesh is the blood thereof: whosoeuer eateth it, shalbe cut off.

15. And euery person that eateth it which dyeth alone, or that which is torne with beastes, whether it be one of the same countrey or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and wash himselfe in water, and be vncleane vnto the euen: after he shalbe cleane.

16. But if he wash them not, nor wash his flesh, then he shall beare his iniquitie.

20. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits [for] a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the 

21. So ye shall proclayme the same day, that it may be an holie conuocation vnto you: ye shall doe no seruile worke therein: it shalbe an ordinance for euer in al your dwellinges, throughout your generations.

22. And when you reape the haruest of your land, thou shalt not rid cleane the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou make any aftergathering of thy haruest, but shalt leaue them vnto the poore and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God.

23. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

24. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the 

25. Ye shall do no seruile worke therein, but offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord.

26. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

27. Also on the tenth [day] of this seventh month [there shall be] a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall 

28. And ye shall doe no worke that same day: for it is a day of reconciliation, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God.

29. For euery person that humbleth not himselfe that same day, shall euen be cut off from his people.

30. And euery person that shall doe any work that same day, the same person also will I destroy from among his people.

31. Ye shall do no maner worke therefore: this shalbe a law for euer in your generations, throughout all your dwellings.

32. It [shall be] unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth [day] of the month at even, from 

33. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

34. Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say, In the fifteenth day of this seueth moneth shalbe for seuen dayes the feast of Tabernacles vnto the Lorde.

35. In the first day shalbe an holie conuocation: ye shall do no seruile worke therein.

36. Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it [is] a 

37. These [are] the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a 

38. Beside the Sabbaths of the Lorde, and beside your giftes, and beside al your vowes, and beside all your free offrings, which ye shal giue vnto the Lorde.

39. Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day [shall be] a 

40. And yee shall take you in the first day the fruite of goodly trees, branches of palme trees, & the boughes of thicke trees, and willowes of the brooke, and shall reioyce before the Lorde your God seuen daies.

41. So ye shall keepe this feast vnto the Lorde seuen daies in the yere, by a perpetuall ordinance through your generations: in the seuenth moneth shall you keepe it.

42. Ye shall dwell in boothes seuen daies: all that are Israelites borne, shall dwel in boothes,

43. That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in 

44. So Moses declared vnto the children of Israel the feastes of the Lord.

## Leviticus 24

1. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. 
          

3. Without the vail 

4. He shall dresse the lampes vpon the pure Candlesticke before the Lorde perpetually.

5. And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two 

6. And thou shalt set them in two rowes, six in a rowe vpon the pure table before the Lorde.

7. And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon [each] row, that 

8. Euery Sabbath hee shall put them in rowes before the Lord euermore, receiuing them of the children of Israel for an euerlasting couenant.

9. And the bread shalbe Aaros & his sonnes, and they shall eate it in the holie place: for it is most holie vnto him of the offrings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetuall ordinance.

10. And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father [was] an Egyptian, went 

11. And the Israelitish woman's son 

12. And they put him in warde, till he tolde them the minde of the Lorde.

13. Then the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,

14. Bring the blasphemer without the hoste, and let all that heard him, put their handes vpon his head, and let all the Congregation stone him.

15. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall 

16. And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shalbe put to death: all the Congregation shall stone him to death: aswell the stranger, as he that is borne in the lande: when he blasphemeth the name of the Lorde, let him beslaine.

17. He also that killeth any man, he shal be put to death.

18. And he that killeth a beast, he shal restore it, beast for beast.

19. Also if a man cause any blemish in his neighbour: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him.

20. Breache for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: such a blemish as he hath made in any, such shalbe repayed to him.

21. And he that killeth a beast shall restore it: but he that killeth a man shall be slaine.

22. Ye shall haue one lawe: it shalbe aswel for the stranger as for one borne in the countrey: for I am the Lorde your God.

23. And 

## Leviticus 25

1. And the Lorde spake vnto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

2. Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye shall come into the lande which I giue you, the lande shall keepe Sabbath vnto the Lorde.

3. 
          

4. But the seuenth yeere shalbe a Sabbath of rest vnto the lande: it shall be the Lordes Sabbath: thou shalt neither sowe thy fielde, nor cut thy vineyarde.

5. That which groweth of its 

6. And the 

7. And for thy cattell, and for the beastes that are in thy lande shall all the encrease thereof be meate.

8. Also thou shalt number seuen Sabbaths of yeeres vnto thee, euen seuen times seuen yeere: and the space of the seuen Sabbaths of yeeres will be vnto thee nine and fourtie yeere.

9. 
          

10. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the 

11. This fiftieth yeere shalbe a yeere of Iubile vnto you: ye shall not sowe, neither reape that which groweth of it selfe, neither gather the grapes thereof, that are left vnlaboured.

12. For it is the Iubile, it shall be holy vnto you: ye shall eate of the encrease thereof out of the fielde.

13. In the yeere of this Iubile, ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession.

14. And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest [ought] of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall 

15. According to the number of 

16. According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for [according] to the number [of the years] of the 

17. Oppresse not ye therefore any man his neighbour, but thou shalt feare thy God: for I am the Lorde your God.

18. Wherefore ye shall obey mine ordinances, and keepe my lawes, and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safetie.

19. And the lande shall giue her fruite, and ye shall eate your fill, and dwell therein in safetie.

20. And if ye shall say, What shall we eate the seuenth yeere, for we shall not sowe, nor gather in our increase?

21. I will sende my blessing vpon you in the sixt yeere, and it shall bring foorth fruite for three yeeres.

22. And ye shall sowe the eight yeere, & eate of the olde fruite vntill the ninth yeere: vntill the fruite thereof come, ye shall eate the olde.

23. The land shall not be sold 

24. And in all the land of your possession ye shall 

25. If thy brother be impouerished, and sell his possession, then his redeemer shall come, euen his neere kinsman, and bye out that which his brother solde.

26. And if he haue no redeemer, but hath gotten and founde to bye it out,

27. Then let him 

28. But if he be not able to restore [it] to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go 

29. Likewise if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled citie, he may bye it out againe within a whole yeere after it is solde: within a yeere may he bye it out.

30. And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that [is] in the walled city shall be established 

31. But the houses of villages, which haue no walles round about them, shalbe esteemed as the fielde of the countrey: they may be bought out againe, and shall goe out in the Iubile.

32. Notwithstanding, the cities of the Leuites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Leuites redeeme at all seasons.

33. And if a man purchase of the Leuites, the house that was solde, and the citie of their possession shall goe out in the Iubile: for the houses of the cities of the Leuites are their possession among the children of Israel.

34. But the field of the 

35. And if thy brother be waxen poor, and 

36. Thou shalt take no vsurie of him, nor vantage, but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may liue with thee.

37. Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lende him thy vitailes for increase.

38. I am the Lorde your God, which haue brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to giue you the lande of Canaan, and to be your God.

39. If thy brother also that dwelleth by thee, be impouerished, and be sold vnto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serue as a bond seruant,

40. But as an hired seruant, and as a soiourner he shalbe with thee: he shall serue thee vnto the yeere of the Iubile.

41. Then shall he depart from thee, both hee, and his children with him, and shall returne vnto his familie, and vnto the possession of his fathers shall he returne:

42. For they [are] my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not 

43. Thou shalt not rule ouer him cruelly, but shalt feare thy God.

44. Thy bond seruant also, & thy bond maid, which thou shalt haue, shalbe of the heathen that are rounde about you: of them shall ye bye seruants and maydes.

45. Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that [are] with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your 

46. So ye shall take them as inheritance for your children after you, to possesse them by inheritance, ye shall vse their labours for euer: but ouer your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule one ouer another with crueltie.

47. If a soiourner or a stranger dwelling by thee get riches, & thy brother by him be impouerished, and sell him selfe vnto the stranger or soiourner dwelling by thee, or to the stocke of the strangers familie,

48. After that he is solde, he may be bought out: one of his brethren may bye him out,

49. Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or [any] that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or 

50. And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of 

51. If there be many yeeres behind, according to them he shall giue againe for his deliuerance, of the money that he was bought for.

52. If there remaine but fewe yeeres vnto the yeere of Iubile, then he shall count with him, and according to his yeeres giue againe for his redemption.

53. [And] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule with rigour over him in thy 

54. And if he be not redeemed thus, he shal go out in the yeere of Iubile, he, and his children with him.

55. For vnto me the children of Israel are seruants: they are my seruants, who I haue brought out of the land of Egypt: I am ye Lord your God.

## Leviticus 26

1. Ye shall make you none idoles nor grauen image, neither reare you vp any pillar, neither shal ye set any image of stone in your land to bow downe to it: for I am the Lord your God.

2. Ye shall keepe my Sabbaths, and reuerence my Sanctuarie: I am the Lorde.

3. If ye walke in mine ordinances, and keepe my commandements, and doe them,

4. Then I will give you 

5. And your threshing shall reache vnto the vintage, and the vintage shall reache vnto sowing time, and you shall eate your bread in plenteousnesse, and dwell in your land safely.

6. And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make [you] afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the 

7. Also ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you vpon the sworde.

8. And fiue of you shall chase an hundreth, and an hundreth of you shall put ten thousande to flight, and your enemies shall fall before you vpon the sworde.

9. For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and 

10. Ye shall eate also olde store, and cary out olde because of the newe.

11. And I will set my 

12. Also I will walke among you, and I wil be your God, and ye shalbe my people.

13. I [am] the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the 

14. But if ye will not obey me, nor do all these commandements,

15. And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, [but] that ye break my 

16. Then wil I also do this vnto you, I wil appoint ouer you fearefulnes, a consumption, and the burning ague to consume the eyes, and make the heart heauie, and you shall sowe your seede in vaine: for your enemies shall eate it:

17. And I will set 

18. And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you 

19. And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as 

20. And your strength shalbe spent in vaine: neither shall your lande giue her increase, neither shall the trees of the land giue their fruite.

21. And if ye walk 

22. I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall 

23. Yet if by these ye will not be reformed by me, but walke stubburnly against me,

24. Then wil I also walke stubburnly against you, and I will smite you yet seuen times for your sinnes:

25. And I wil send a sword vpon you, that shal auenge the quarel of my couenant: and when ye are gathered in your cities, I wil send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be deliuered into the hand of the enemie.

26. [And] when I have broken the 

27. Yet if ye will not for this obey mee, but walke against me stubburnly,

28. Then will I walke stubburnly in mine anger against you, and I will also chastice you seuen times more according to your sinnes.

29. And ye shall eate ye flesh of your sonnes, & the flesh of your daughters shall ye deuoure.

30. I will also destroy your hye places, & cut away your images, and cast your carkeises vpon the bodies of your idoles, and my soule shall abhorre you.

31. And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I 

32. I will also bring the land vnto a wildernes, and your enemies, which dwell therein, shalbe astonished thereat.

33. Also I wil scatter you among the heathen, and will drawe out a sworde after you, & your land shalbe waste, & your cities shalbe desolate.

34. Then shall the land inioy her Sabbaths, as long as it lieth voide, and yee shalbe in your enemies land: then shall the land rest, and enioy her Sabbaths.

35. As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your 

36. And upon them that are left [alive] of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall 

37. They shall fall also one vpon another, as before a sword, though none pursue them, and ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies:

38. And ye shall perish among the heathen, & the land of your enemies shall eate you vp.

39. And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with 

40. Then they shall confesse their iniquitie, & the wickednes of their fathers for their trespasse, which they haue trespassed against mee, and also because they haue walked stubburnly against me.

41. Therefore I wil walke stubburnly against them, and bring them into the land of their enemies: so then their vncircumcised hearts shalbe humbled, and then they shalt willingly beare the punishment of their iniquitie.

42. Then I will remember my couenant with Iaakob, and my couenant also with Izhak, and also my couenant with Abraham will I remember, and will remember the land.

43. 
          

44. Yet notwithstanding this, when they shalbe in the lande of their enemies, I wil not cast them away, neither will I abhorre them, to destroy them vtterly, nor to breake my couenant with them: for I am the Lord their God:

45. But I will for their sakes remember the 

46. These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount 

## Leviticus 27

1. Moreouer the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a 

3. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty 

4. But if it be a female, then thy valuation shal be thirtie shekels.

5. And from fiue yere old to twentie yere olde thy valuation shall be for the male twentie shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

6. And if [it be] from a 

7. And from sixty yeere olde and aboue, if he be a male, then thy price shalbe fifteene shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

8. But if he be poorer 

9. And if [it be] a 

10. He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be 

11. And if it be any vncleane beast, of which men do not offer a sacrifice vnto the Lorde, hee shall then present the beast before the Priest.

12. And the Priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: and as thou valuest it, which art the Priest, so shall it bee.

13. But if he will bye it againe, then hee shall giue the fift part of it more, aboue thy valuation.

14. Also whe a man shall dedicate his house to be holy vnto the Lorde, then the Priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad, and as ye Priest shall prise it, so shall the value be.

15. But if he that sanctified it, will redeeme his house, then hee shall giue thereto the fift part of money more then thy estimation, & it shalbe his.

16. And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD [some part] of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an 

17. If he dedicate his field immediately from the yeere of Iubile, it shall bee worth as thou doest esteeme it.

18. But if hee dedicate his fielde after the Iubile, then the Priest shall recken him the money according to ye yeeres that remaine vnto the yere of Iubile, and it shalbe abated by thy estimation.

19. And if he that dedicateth it, will redeeme the fielde, then he shall put the fift parte of the price, that thou esteemedst it at, thereunto, and it shall remaine his.

20. And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have 

21. But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be 

22. If a man also dedicate vnto ye Lord a fielde which he hath bought, which is not of the groud of his inheritance,

23. Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, [even] unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give 

24. But in the yeere of Iubile, the fielde shall returne vnto him, of whome it was bought: to him, I say, whose inheritance the land was.

25. And all thy valuation shall bee according to the shekel of the Sanctuarie: a shekel conteyneth twenty gerahs.

26. Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether [it be] ox, or sheep: it [is] the 

27. But if it be an vncleane beast, then he shall redeeme it by thy valuation, and giue the fift part more thereto: & if it be not redeemed, then it shalbe solde, according to thy estimation.

28. Notwithstanding, nothing separate from the common vse that a man doeth separate vnto the Lord of all that he hath (whether it bee man or beast, or lande of his inheritance) may be solde nor redeemed: for euery thing separate from the common vse is most holy vnto the Lorde.

29. None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; [but] shall surely be 

30. Also all the tithe of the lande both of the seede of the ground, and of the fruite of the trees is the Lords: it is holy to the Lorde.

31. And if a man will at all redeem [ought] of his tithes, he shall add thereto the 

32. And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, [even] of whatsoever passeth under the 

33. He shal not looke if it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: els if he change it, both it, and that it was changed withall, shalbe holy, and it shall not be redeemed.

34. These are the commaundements which the Lord commaunded by Moses vnto the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
