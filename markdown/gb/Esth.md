1. Now it came to pass in the days of 

2. [That] in those days, when the king Ahasuerus 

3. In the third yeere of his reigne, he made a feast vnto all his princes and his seruants, euen the power of Persia and Media, and to the captaines and gouernours of the prouinces which were before him,

4. That he might shewe the riches & glorie of his kingdome, and the honour of his great maiestie many dayes, euen an hundreth and foure score dayes.

5. And when these dayes were expired, the King made a feast to all the people that were founde in the palace of Shushan, both vnto great and small, seuen dayes, in the court of the garden of the Kings palace,

6. [Where were] white, green, and blue, [hangings], fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the 

7. And they gave [them] drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the

12. But the Queene Vashti refused to come at the Kings worde, which he had giuen in charge to the eunuches: therefore the King was very angry, and his wrath kindled in him.

13. Then the king said to the wise men, 

14. And the next unto him [was] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, [and] Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the

16. And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done

1. After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he 

2. And the Kings seruants that ministred vnto him, sayd, Let them seeke for the King beautifull yong virgins,

3. And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, 

4. And the mayde that shall please the King, let her reigne in the steade of Vashti; this pleased the King, and he did so.

5. In the citie of Shushan, there was a certaine Iewe, whose name was Mordecai the sonne of Iair, the sonne of Shimei, the sonne of Kish a man of Iemini,

6. Which had bene caryed away from Ierusalem with the captiuitie that was caryed away with Ieconiah King of Iudah (whom Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel had caryed away)

7. And he nourished Hadassah, that is Ester, his vncles daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, & the mayde was fayre, and beautifull to looke on: & after the death of her father, and her mother, Mordecai tooke her for his own daughter

8. And when the Kings commandement, and his decree was published, and many maydes were brought together to the palace of Shushan, vnder the hand of Hege, Ester was brought also vnto the Kings house vnder the hande of Hege the keeper of the women.

9. And the mayde pleased him, & she founde fauour in his sight: therefore he caused her things for purification to be giuen her speedily, and her state, and seuen comely maides to be giuer her out of the Kings house, and he gaue change to her and to her maydes of the best in the house of the women.

10. But Ester shewed not her people and her kinred: for Mordecai had charged her, that shee should not tell it.

11. And Mordecai walked 

12. And when the course of euery mayd came, to go in to King Ahashuerosh, after that she had bene twelue moneths according to the maner of the women (for so were the dayes of their purifications accomplished, sixe moneths with oyle of myrrhe, and sixe moneths with sweete odours and in the purifying of the women:

13. Then thus came [every] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was 

14. In the euening she went, & on the morow she returned into the second house of the women vnder the hand of Shaashgaz the Kings eunuche, which kept the concubines: shee came in to the King no more, except shee pleased the King, and that she were called by name.

15. Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, 

16. So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which [is] the 

17. And the King loued Ester aboue all the women, and shee founde grace and fauour in his sight more then all the virgins: so that he set the crowne of the kingdome vpon her head, & made her Queene instead of Vashti.

18. Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, [even] Esther's 

19. And when the virgins were gathered together the 

20. Ester had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her: for Ester did after the worde of Mordecai, as when she was nourished with him.

21. In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay 

22. And the thing was knowen to Mordecai, and he tolde it vnto Queene Ester, and Ester certified the King thereof in Mordecais name:

23. And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the 

## Esther 3

1. After these things did King Ahashuerosh promote Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite, and exalted him, and set his seate aboue all the princes that were with him.

2. And all the king's servants, that [were] in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai 

3. Then the Kings seruants which were at the Kings gate, said vnto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the Kings commandement?

4. Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they 

5. And when Haman sawe that Mordecai bowed not the knee vnto him, nor did reuerence vnto him, then Haman was full of wrath.

6. Now he thought it too litle to lay hands onely on Mordecai: & because they had shewed him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Iewes, that were throughout the whole kingdome of Ahashuerosh, euen the people of Mordecai.

7. In the first month, that [is], the month 

8. And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws [are] diverse from all people; neither keep they the 

9. If it please the King, let it be written that they may he destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of siluer by the handes of them that haue the charge of this businesse to bring it into the Kings treasurie.

10. Then the King tooke his ring from his hand & gaue it vnto Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite the Iewes aduersarie.

11. And the King sayde vnto Haman, Let the siluer be thine, and the people to doe with them as it pleaseth thee.

12. Then were the Kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first moneth, and there was written (according to all that Haman commaunded) vnto the Kings officers, and to the captaines that were ouer euery prouince, and to the rulers of euery people, and to euery prouince, according to the writing thereof, and to euery people according to their language: in the name of King Ahashuerosh was it written, and sealed with the Kings ring.

13. And the letters were sent by postes into all the Kings prouinces, to roote out, to kill and to destroy all the Iewes, both yong & olde, children and women, in one day vpon the thirteenth day of the twelft moneth, (which is the moneth Adar) and to spoyle them as a pray. {\cf2 (13:1) The copie of the letters was this, The great King Artaxerxes writeth these thinges to the princes and gouernours that are vnder him from India vnto Ethiopia in an hundreth and seuen and twentie prouinces. (13:2) When I was made Lord ouer many people, and had subdued the whole earth vnto my dominion, I would not exalt my selfe by the reason of my power, but purposed with equitie alway and gentlenesse to gouerne my subiects, and wholy to set them in a peaceable life, and thereby to bring my kingdome vnto tranquilitie, that men might safely goe thorow on euery side, and to renewe peace againe, which all men desire. (13:3) Now when I asked my counsellers how these things might be brought to passe, one that was conuersant with vs, of excellent wisdome, and constant in good wil, and shewed him selfe to be of sure fidelitie, which had the second place in the kingdome, euen Aman, (13:4) Declared vnto vs, that in all nations there was scattered abroad a rebellious people, that had lawes contrary to all people, and haue alway despised the commandements of Kings, and so that this generall empire, that we haue begunne, cannot be gouerned without offence. (13:5) Seeing nowe wee perceiue, that this people alone are altogether contrary vnto euery man, vsing strange and other maner of lawes, and hauing an euill opinion of our doings, and goe about to stablish wicked matters, that our kingdome should not come to good estate, (13:6) Therefore haue we comaunded, that all they that are appointed in writing vnto you by Aman (which is ordeined ouer ye affaires, & is as our second father) shall all with their wiues and children be destroyed & rooted out with ye sword of their enemies without all mercy, and that none be spared the fourtenth day of the twelfth moneth Adar of this yeere, (13:7) That they which of olde, and nowe also haue euer bene rebellious, may in one day with violence be thrust downe into the hell, to the intent that after this time our affaires may bee without troubles, and well gouerned in all pointes.}

14. The contents of the writing was, that there shoulde be giuen a commandement in all prouinces, and published vnto all people, that they should be ready against the same day.

15. The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the 

## Esther 4

1. Now when Mordecai perceiued all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackecloth and ashes, and went out into the middes of the citie, and cryed with a great crye, and a bitter.

2. And came even before the king's 

3. And in euery prouince, and place, whither the Kings charge and his commission came, there was great sorowe among the Iewes, and fasting, and weeping and mourning, and many laye in sackecloth and in ashes.

4. Then Esters maydes and her eunuches came and tolde it her: therefore the Queene was very heauie, and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackecloth from him, but he receiued it not.

5. Then called Ester Hatach one of the Kings eunuches, whom he had appointed to serue her, and gaue him a commandement vnto Mordecai, to knowe what it was, and why it was.

6. So Hatach went foorth to Mordecai vnto the streete of the citie, which was before the Kings gate.

7. And Mordecai tolde him of all that which had come vnto him, and of the summe of the siluer that Haman had promised to pay vnto the Kings treasures, because of the Iewes, for to destroy them.

8. Also he gaue him the copy of the writing and commission that was giuen at Shushan, to destroy them, that he might shewe it vnto Ester and declare it vnto her, and to charge her that she should goe in to the King, and make petition and supplication before him for her people.

9. So when Hatach came, he told Ester the wordes of Mordecai.

10. Then Ester sayde vnto Hatach, and commaunded him to say vnto Mordecai,

11. All the Kings seruants and the people of the Kings prouinces doe knowe, that whosoeuer, man or woman, that commeth to the King into the inner court, which is not called, there is a law of his, that he shall dye, except him to whom the King holdeth out the golden rodde, that he may liue. Now I haue not bene called to come vnto the King these thirtie dayes.

12. And they certified Mordecai of Esters wordes.

13. And Mordecai saide, that they should answere Ester thus, Thinke not with thy selfe that thou shalt escape in the Kings house, more then all the Iewes.

14. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, [then] shall there enlargement and deliverance 

15. Then Ester commanded to answere Mordecai,

16. Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which [is] not according to the law: and if I perish, 

17. So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Ester had commaunded him. {\cf2 (13:8) Then Mardocheus thought vpon all ye workes and of the Lord, and made his prayer vnto him, (13:9) Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty (for all things are in thy power) & if thou hast appointed to saue Israel, there is no man that can withstand thee. (13:10) For thou hast made heauen and earth, and all the wonderous things vnder the heauen. (13:11) Thou art Lorde of all thinges, and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord. (13:12) Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither of malice, nor presumption, nor for any desire of glory, that I did this, and not bowe downe to proude Aman. (13:13) For I woulde haue bene content with good will for the saluation of Israel, to haue kist the sole of his feete. (13:14) But I did it, because I would not preferre the honour of a man aboue the glory of God, & would not worship any but onely thee, my Lorde, and this haue I not done of pride. (13:15) And therefore, O Lord God and King, haue mercy vpon thy people: for they imagine how they may bring vs to naught, yea, they would destroy the inheritance, that hath bin thine from the beginning. (13:16) Despise not the portion, which thou hast deliuered out of Egypt for thine owne selfe. (13:17) Heare my prayer, and bee mercifull vnto thy portion: turne our sorow into ioy, that we may liue, O Lord, and praise thy Name: shut not the mouthes of them that praise thee. (13:18) All Israel in like maner cried most earnestly vnto the Lord, because that death was before their eyes. \par (14:1) Qveene Esther also, being in danger of death, resorted vnto the Lord, (14:2) And layd away her glorious apparell, and put on the garments of sighing, and mourning. In the stead of precious oyntment, she scattered ashes, and dongue vpon her head: and she humbled her body greatly with fasting, and all the places of her ioy filled she with the heare that she pluckt off. (14:3) And she prayed vnto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O my Lorde, thou onely art our King: helpe me desolate woman, which haue no helper but thee. (14:4) For my danger is at hand. (14:5) From my youth vp I haue heard in the kinred of my father, that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathers from their predecessours for a perpetuall inheritance, and thou hast performed that which thou didest promise them. (14:6) Now Lord, we haue sinned before thee: therefore hast thou giuen vs into ye hands of our enemies. (14:7) Because we worshipped their gods, O Lorde, thou art righteous. (14:8) Neuerthelesse, it satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captiuitie, but they haue stroken hands with their idoles, (14:9) That they wil abolish the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordeined, & destroy thine inheritace, to shut vp the mouth of them that praise thee, and to quench the glory of thy Temple, and of thine altar, (14:10) And to open the mouths of the heathen, that they may praise the power of the idoles, and to magnifie a fleshly King for euer. (14:11) O Lord, giue not thy scepter vnto them that be nothing, lest they laugh vs to scorne in our miserie: but turne their deuise vpon theselues, and make him an example, that hath begunne the same against vs. (14:12) Thinke vpon vs, O Lord, and shewe thy selfe vnto vs in the time of our distresse, and strengthen me, O King of gods, and Lord of all power. (14:13) Giue me an eloquent speach in my mouth before the Lion: turne his heart to hate our enemie, to destroy him, and all such as consent vnto him. (14:14) But deliuer vs with thine hand, and helpe me that am solitary, which haue no defence but onely thee. (14:15) Thou knowest all things, O Lord: thou knowest, that I hate the glory of the vnrighteous, and that I abhorre the bed of the vncircumcised, and of all the heathen. (14:16) Thou knowest my necessitie: for I hate this token of my preeminence, which I beare vpon mine head, what time as I must shewe my selfe, and that I abhorre it as a menstruous cloth, and that I weare it not when I am alone by my selfe, (14:17) And that I thine handmayde haue not eaten at Amans table, and that I haue had no pleasure in the Kings feast, nor drunke the wine of the drinke offerings, (14:18) And that I thine handmayde haue no ioye since the day that I was brought hither, vntill this day, but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham. (14:19) O thou mighty God aboue al, heare the voyce of them, that haue none other hope, & deliuer vs out of the hand of ye wicked, & deliuer me out of my feare.}

2. And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, [that] she obtained favour in his sight: and the king

4. Then saide Ester, If it please the King, let the King & Haman come this day vnto the banket, that I haue prepared for him.

5. And the King sayd, Cause Haman to make haste that he may doe as Ester hath sayde. So the King and Haman came to the banket that Ester had prepared.

6. And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of 

7. Then answered Ester, and sayd, My petition and my request is,

9. Then went Haman forth the same day ioyfull and with a glad heart. But when Haman sawe Mordecai in the Kings gate, that he stoode not vp, nor moued for him, then was Haman full of indignation at Mordecai.

10. Neuerthelesse Haman refrayned himselfe: and when he came home, he sent, and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

11. And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all [the things] wherein the king had

1. The same night the King slept not, & he comanded to bring ye booke of the records, and the chronicles: & they were read before ye King.

2. Then it was found written that Mordecai had tolde of Bigtana, and Teresh two of the Kings eunuches, keepers of the dore, who sought to lay hands on the King Ahashuerosh.

3. And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai 

4. And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to 

5. And the Kings seruants said vnto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court; the King sayd, Let him come in.

6. And when Haman came in, the King saide vnto him, What shalbe done vnto ye man, whom the King will honour? Then Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the King do honour more then to me?

7. And Haman answered the King, The man whome the King would honour,

8. Let the royal apparel be brought which the king [useth] to wear, and the 

9. And let the raiment and the horse be deliuered by the hand of one of the Kings most noble princes, & let them apparel the man (whome the King will honour) and cause him to ride vpon the horse thorow the streete of the citie, and proclayme before him, Thus shall it be done vnto the man, whome the King will honour.

10. Then the King said to Haman, Make haste, take the rayment and the horse as thou hast said, and doe so vnto Mordecai the Iewe, that sitteth at the Kings gate: let nothing fayle of all that thou hast spoken.

11. So Haman tooke the rayment and the horse, and arayed Mordecai, and brought him on horse backe thorowe the streete of the citie, and proclaymed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the King will honour.

12. And Mordecai came againe to the Kings gate, but Haman hasted home mourning and his head couered.

13. And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai [be] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, 

14. And while they were yet talking with him, came the Kings eunuches & hasted to bring Haman vnto the banket that Ester had prepared.

## Esther 7

1. So the King and Haman came to banket with the Queene Ester.

2. And the King said againe vnto Ester on the second day at the banket of wine, What is thy petition, Queene Ester, that it may be giue thee? and what is thy request? It shalbe euen perfourmed vnto the halfe of the kingdome.

3. And Ester the Queene answered, and said, If I haue found fauour in thy sight, O King, and if it please the King, let my life be giuen me at my petition, and my people at my request.

4. For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not 

5. Then King Ahashuerosh answered, and said vnto the Queene Ester, Who is he? and where is he that presumeth to doe thus?

6. And Ester said, The aduersarie and enemie is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afrayde before the King and the Queene.

7. And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath [went] into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was 

8. Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was

10. So they hanged Haman on the tree, that he had prepared for Mordecai: then was the Kings wrath pacified.

## Esther 8

1. On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai 

2. And the King tooke off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gaue it vnto Mordecai: and Ester set Mordecai ouer the house of Haman.

3. And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the 

4. Then the king held out the golden 

5. And sayd, If it please the King, & if I haue found fauour in his sight, and the thing be acceptable before the King, and I please him, let it be written, that the letters of the deuice of Haman the sonne of Ammedatha the Agagite may be called againe, which he wrote to destroy the Iewes, that are in all the Kings prouinces.

6. For how can I suffer and see the euil, that shall come vnto my people? Or howe can I suffer and see the destruction of my kinred?

7. And the King Ahashuerosh sayde vnto the Queene Ester, & to Mordecai the Iewe, Behold, I haue giuen Ester the house of Haman, whome they haue hanged vpon the tree, because he layd hand vpon the Iewes.

8. Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may

10. And hee wrote in the King Ahashuerosh name, and sealed it with the Kings ring: and he sent letters by postes on horsebacke and that rode on beastes of price, as dromedaries and coltes of mares.

11. Wherein the king granted the Jews which [were] in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for

15. And Mordecai went out from the King in royall apparell of blewe, and white, and with a great crowne of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple, and the citie of Shushan reioyced and was glad.

16. The Jews had light, and

10. The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but 

11. On the same day came ye nomber of those that were slayne, vnto the palace of Shushan before the King.

12. And the King sayd vnto the Queene Ester, The Iewes haue slayne in Shushan the palace and destroyed fiue hundreth men, & the ten sonnes of Haman: what haue they done in the rest of the Kings prouinces? and what is thy petition, that it may be giuen thee? or what is thy request moreouer, that it may be performed?

13. Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which [are] in Shushan to do to morrow also according 

14. And the King charged to doe so, and the decree was giuen at Shushan, and they hanged Hamans ten sonnes.

15. So the Iewes that were in Shushan, assembled themselues vpon the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar, & slew three hundreth men in Shushan, but on the spoyle they layd not their hand.

16. But the other Jews that [were] in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for
