11. They shall perish, but thou doest remaine: and they all shall waxe olde as doeth a garment.

12. And as a vesture shalt thou folde them vp, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy yeeres shall not faile.

13. 
          

14. Are they not all

4. God also bearing [them] witness, both with 

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. Thou 

8. Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Forasmuch then as the children are 

15. And deliver them who through fear of

## Hebrews 3

1. Wherefore, 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. For euery house is builded of some man, and he that hath built all things, is God.

5. And 

6. But Christ as a son over his own house; 

7. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye 

8. Harden not your hearts, as in the 

9. Where your fathers tempted me, prooued me, and sawe my workes fourtie yeeres long.

10. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway 

11. Therefore I sware in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.

12. 
          

13. But exhort one another daily, 

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. For some when they heard, prouoked him to anger: howbeit, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

17. But with whome was he displeased fourtie yeeres? Was hee not displeased with them that sinned, whose carkeises fell in the wildernes?

18. And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but vnto them that obeyed not?

19. So we see that they could not enter in, because of vnbeliefe.

## Hebrews 4

1. Let vs feare therefore, least at any time by forsaking the promes of entring into his rest, any of you should seeme to be depriued.

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. For he spake in a certaine place of the seuenth day on this wise, And God did rest the seuenth day from all his workes.

5. And in this place againe, If they shall enter into my rest.

6. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter thereinto, & they to whom it was first preached, entred not therein for vnbeliefes sake:

7. Againe he appointed in Dauid a certaine day, by To day, after so long a time, saying, as it is sayd, This day, if ye heare his voyce, harden not your hearts.

8. For if 

9. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in 

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. Let vs therefore goe boldly vnto ye throne of grace, that we may receiue mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede.

## Hebrews 5

1. For 

2. Who 

3. And for the sames sake he is bound to offer for sinnes, as wel for his own part, as for ye peoples.

4. 
          

5. So likewise Christ tooke not to him selfe this honour, to be made the hie Priest, but hee that sayd vnto him, Thou art my Sonne, this day begate I thee, gaue it him.

6. As he saith also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the 

7. 
          

8. Though he were a Son, yet 

9. 
          

10. And is called of God an hie Priest after the order of Melchisedec.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the 

14. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their

1. Therefore leaving the 

2. Of the doctrine of baptismes, and laying on of hands, & of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternall iudgement.

3. And this will we doe if God permit.

4. 
          

5. And haue tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come,

6. If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they 

7. 
          

8. But that which beareth thornes and briars, is reproued, and is neere vnto cursing, whose end is to be burned.

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. And we desire that euery one of you shew the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope vnto the ende,

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Saying, Surely 

15. And so after that he had taried patiently, he enioyed the promes.

16. For men verely sweare by him that is greater then themselues, and an othe for confirmation is among them an ende of all strife.

17. Wherein God, willing more 

18. That by two immutable things, wherein it is vnpossible that God should lye, we might haue strong consolation, which haue our refuge to lay holde vpon that hope that is set before vs,

19. 
          

20. 
          

## Hebrews 7

1. For this 

2. To whom also Abraham gaue the tithe of all things: who first is by interpretation King of righteousnes: after that, he is also King of Salem, that is, King of peace,

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they 

6. But he whose kindred is not couted among them, receiued tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

7. And 

8. And here men that die, receiue tithes: but there he receiueth them, of whome it is witnessed, that he liueth.

9. 
          

10. For hee was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham, when Melchi-sedec met him.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man 

14. For it is euident, that our Lord sprung out of Iuda, concerning the which tribe Moses spake nothing, touching the Priesthood.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. For hee testifieth thus, Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of Melchi-sedec.

18. 
          

19. For the Law made nothing perfite, but the bringing in of a better hope made perfite, whereby we drawe neere vnto God.

20. 
          

21. But this is made with an othe by him that said vnto him, The Lord hath sworne, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of Melchi-sedec)

22. By so much is Iesus made a suretie of a better Testament.

23. 
          

24. But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an 

25. Wherefore he is 

26. 
          

27. Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: 

28. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the 

## Hebrews 8

1. Now 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. Who serue vnto the paterne and shadowe of heauenly things, as Moses was warned by God, whe he was about to finish the Tabernacle. See, saide hee, that thou make all thinges according to the paterne, shewed to thee in the mount.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the 

9. Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to leade them out of the land of Egypt: for they continued not in my Testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

10. For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Lawes in their minde, and in their heart I will write them, and I wil be their God, and they shalbe my people,

11. And they shall not teache euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall knowe me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.

12. For I will bee mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and I wil remember their sinnes and their iniquities no more.

13. 
          

## Hebrews 9

1. Then verily 

2. For the first Tabernacle was made, wherein was the candlesticke, and the table, and the shewebread, which Tabernacle is called the Holy places.

3. And after 

4. Which had the golden censer, and the Arke of the Testament ouerlayde rounde about with golde, wherein the golden pot, which had Manna, was, and Aarons rod that had budded, and the tables of the Testament.

5. And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the 

6. 
          

7. But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from 

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. For the Testament is confirmed when men are dead: for it is yet of no force as long as he that made it, is aliue.

18. 
          

19. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people 

20. Saying, This is the blood of the Testament, which God hath appointed vnto you.

21. Moreouer, he sprinkled likewise the Tabernacle with blood also, and all the ministring vessels.

22. And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood, and without sheading of blood is no remission.

23. [It was] therefore necessary that the 

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. And as it is appointed unto men 

28. So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of 

## Hebrews 10

1. For 

2. For would they not then haue ceased to haue bene offered, because that the offerers once purged, should haue had no more conscience of sinnes?

3. But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance againe of sinnes euery yeere.

4. For it is vnpossible that the blood of bulles and goates should take away sinnes.

5. 
          

6. In burnt offerings, and sinne offrings thou hast had no pleasure.

7. Then I sayd, Lo, I come (In the beginning of the booke it is written of me) that I should doe thy will, O God.

8. Aboue, when he sayd, Sacrifice and offring, and burnt offrings, and sinne offrings thou wouldest not haue, neither hadst pleasure therein (which are offered by the Lawe)

9. Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the 

10. By the which wil we are sanctified, euen by the offring of the body of Iesus Christ once made.

11. 
          

12. But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, sitteth for euer at the right hand of God,

13. 
          

14. For with one offering hath he consecrated for euer them that are sanctified.

15. 
          

16. This is the Testament that I will make vnto them after those dayes, sayth the Lord, I wil put my Lawes in their heart, and in their mindes I will write them.

17. And their sins and iniquities will I remember 

18. Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for 

19. 
          

20. By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his 

21. And seeing we haue an hie Priest, which is ouer the house of God,

22. 
          

23. And washed in our bodies with pure water, let vs keepe the profession of our hope, without wauering, (for he is faithfull that promised)

24. And let vs consider one another, to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes,

25. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: 

26. For if we sin 

27. But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the 

28. 
          

29. Of howe much sorer punishment suppose ye shall hee be worthy, which treadeth vnder foote the Sonne of God, and counteth the blood of the Testament as an vnholy thing, wherewith he was sanctified, and doeth despite the Spirit of grace?

30. 
          

31. It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God.

32. 
          

33. Partly, whilst ye were made a 

34. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring 

35. Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward.

36. For ye haue neede of patience, that after ye haue done the will of God, ye might receiue the promes.

37. For yet a 

38. 
          

39. But we are not they which withdrawe our selues vnto perdition, but follow faith vnto the conseruation of the soule.

## Hebrews 11

1. Now 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. By faith he abode in the land of promes, as in a strange countrey, as one that dwelt in tents with Isaac and Iacob heires with him of the same promes.

10. For he looked for a city which hath 

11. Through faith Sara also receiued strength to conceiue seede, and was deliuered of a childe when she was past age, because she iudged him faithfull which had promised.

12. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as 

13. These all died in 

14. For they that say such things, declare plainely, that they seeke a countrey.

15. And if they had bene mindfull of that countrey, from whence they came out, they had leasure to haue returned.

16. But nowe they desire a better, that is an heauenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a citie.

17. By faith Abraham, when he was 

18. (To whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seede be called.)

19. Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. By faith Moses when he was come to age, refused to be called the sonne of Pharaohs daughter,

25. Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the 

26. Esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect vnto the recompence of the reward.

27. By faith he forsooke Egypt, and feared not the fiercenes of the king: for he endured, as he that sawe him which is inuisible.

28. Through faith he ordeined the Passeouer and the effusion of blood, least he that destroyed the first borne, should touche them.

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. 
          

32. 
          

33. Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained 

34. Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sworde, of weake were made strong, waxed valiant in battell, turned to flight the armies of the aliants.

35. 
          

36. And others haue bene tryed by mockings and scourgings, yea, moreouer by bondes and prisonment.

37. They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in 

38. Whom the world was not worthie of: they wandered in wildernesses and mountaines, and dennes, and caues of the earth.

39. 
          

40. God having provided some better thing for us, that they 

## Hebrews 12

1. Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. For whom the Lord loueth, he chasteneth: and he scourgeth euery sonne that he receiueth:

7. If ye endure chastening, God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes: for what sonne is it whom the father chasteneth not?

8. If therefore ye be without correction, whereof al are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sonnes.

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Now no chastising for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but, grieuous: but afterwarde, it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteousnesse, vnto them which are thereby exercised.

12. 
          

13. And make 

14. 
          

15.

19. Neither vnto the sounde of a trumpet, and the voyce of wordes, which they that heard it, excused themselues, that the word should not be spoken to them any more,

21. And so terrible was the 

22. But ye are come vnto the mount Sion, and to the citie of the liuing God, the celestiall Hierusalem, and to ye company of innumerable Angels,

23. To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made 

24. And to Iesus the Mediatour of the new Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things then that of Abel.

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. And this worde, Yet once more, signifieth the remouing of those things which are shaken, as of things which are made with hands, that the things which are not shaken, may remaine.

28. 
          

29. For euen our God is a consuming fire.

## Hebrews 13

1. Let 

2. Be not forgetfull to intertaine strangers: for thereby some haue receiued Angels into their houses vnwares.

3. Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] them which suffer adversity, as 

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. 

10. 
          

11. For the bodies of those beastes whose blood is brought into the Holy place by the high Priest for sinne, are burnt without the campe.

12. Therefore euen Iesus, that he might sanctifie the people with his owne blood, suffered without the gate.

13. 
          

14. For here haue we no continuing citie: but we seeke one to come.

15. 
          

16. To doe good, and to distribute forget not: for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. And I desire you somewhat the more earnestly, that yee so doe, that I may be restored to you more quickly.

20. The God of peace that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus, the great shepheard of the sheepe, through the blood of the euerlasting Couenant,

21. Make you 

22. I beseeche you also, brethren, suffer the wordes of exhortation: for I haue written vnto you in fewe wordes.

23. Knowe that our brother Timotheus is deliuered, with whome (if hee come shortly) I will see you.

24. Salute all them that haue the ouersight of you, and all the Saintes. They of Italie salute you.

25. Grace be with you all, Amen. Written to the Hebrewes from Italie, and sent by Timotheus.
