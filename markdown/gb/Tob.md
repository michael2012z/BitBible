# Tobit

## Tobit 1

1. {\cf2 Love righteousnesse, ye that be Iudges of the earth: thinke reuerently of the Lord, and seeke him in simplicitie of heart.}

2. {\cf2 For he wil be found of them that tempt him not, and appeareth vnto such as be not vnfaithfull vnto him.}

3. {\cf2 For wicked thoughts separate from God: and his power when it is tried, reprooueth the vnwise,}

4. {\cf2 Because wisdome cannot enter into a wicked heart, nor dwell in the body that is subiect vnto sinne.}

5. {\cf2 For the holy Spirit of discipline fleeth from deceite, & withdraweth himselfe from the thoughts that are without vnderstanding, and is rebuked when wickednes commeth.}

6. {\cf2 For the Spirit of wisdome is louing, and wil not absolue him, that blasphemeth with his lips: for God is a witnes of his reines, and a true beholder of his heart, and an hearer of the tongue.}

7. {\cf2 For the Spirite of the Lorde filleth all the world: and the same that mainteineth all things, hath knowledge of the voyce.}

8. {\cf2 Therefore hee that speaketh vnrighteous things, cannot be hid: neither shall the iudgement of reproche let him escape.}

9. {\cf2 For inquisition shalbe made for the thoughts of the vngodly, and the sound of his wordes shall come vnto God for the correction of his iniquities.}

10. {\cf2 For the eare of ielousie heareth al things, and the noyse of the grudgings shall not be hid.}

11. {\cf2 Therefore beware of murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refraine your tongue from slander: for there is no worde so secret, that shal go for nought, and the mouth that speaketh lyes, slayeth the soule.}

12. {\cf2 Seeke not death in the errour of your life: destroy not your selues thorowe the workes of your owne hands.}

13. {\cf2 For God hath not made death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the liuing.}

14. {\cf2 For he created all things, that they might haue their being: and the generations of the world are preserued, and there is no poyson of destruction in them, & the kingdome of hell is not vpon earth.}

15. {\cf2 For righteousnes is immortall, but vnrighteousnes bringeth death.}

16. {\cf2 And the vngodly call it vnto them both with hands and wordes: and while they thinke to haue a friend of it, they come to naught: for they are confederate with it: therefore are they worthy to be partakers thereof.}

## Tobit 2

1. {\cf2 For the vngodly say, as they falsly imagine with themselues, Our life is short & tedious: and in the death of a man there is no recouerie, neither was any knowen that hath returned from the graue.}

2. {\cf2 For we are borne at all aduenture, and we shall be hereafter as though we had neuer bene: for the breath is a smoke in our nostrels, & the wordes as a sparke raised out of our heart,}

3. {\cf2 Which being extinguished, the body is turned into ashes, and the Spirite vanisheth as the soft ayre.}

4. {\cf2 Our life shall passe away as the trace of a cloude, and come to naught as the miste that is driuen away with the beames of the sunne, and cast downe with the heate thereof. Our name also shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall haue our workes in remembrance.}

5. {\cf2 For our time is as a shadow that passeth away, and after our ende there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man commeth againe.}

6. {\cf2 Come therefore, and let vs enioy the pleasures, that are present, and let vs cheerefully vse the creatures as in youth.}

7. {\cf2 Let vs fill our selues with costly wine & ointments, & let not the floure of life passe by vs.}

8. {\cf2 Let vs crowne our selues with rose buds afore they be withered.}

9. {\cf2 Let vs all be partakers of our wantonnes: let vs leaue some token of our pleasure in euery place: for that is our portion, and this is our lot.}

10. {\cf2 Let vs oppresse the poore that is righteous: let vs not spare the widdow, nor reuerence ye white heares of the aged, that haue liued many yeeres.}

11. {\cf2 Let our strength be the lawe of vnrighteousnes: for the thing that is feeble, is reprooued as vnprofitable.}

12. {\cf2 Therefore let vs defraude the righteous: for he is not for our profite, and he is contrary to our doings: hee checketh vs for offending against the Law, and blameth vs as transgressers of discipline.}

13. {\cf2 He maketh his boast to haue the knowledge of God: & he calleth himselfe the sonne of ye Lord.}

14. {\cf2 He is made to reprooue our thoughtes.}

15. {\cf2 It grieueth vs also to looke vpon him: for his life is not like other mens: his wayes are of another fashion.}

16. {\cf2 He counteth vs as bastards, and hee withdraweth himselfe from our wayes as from filthines: he commendeth greatly the latter end of the iust, and boasteth that God is his father.}

17. {\cf2 Let vs see then if his wordes be true: let vs prooue what ende he shall haue.}

18. {\cf2 For if the righteous man be the sonne of God, hee wil helpe him, and deliuer him from the hands of his enemies.}

19. {\cf2 Let vs examine him with rebukes and torments that we may know his meekenes, & prooue his patience.}

20. {\cf2 Let vs condemne him vnto a shamefull death: for he shalbe preserued as he himselfe sayth.}

21. {\cf2 Such things doe they imagine, and go astray: for their owne wickednes hath blinded them.}

22. {\cf2 And they doe not vnderstand the mysteries of God, neither hope for the reward of righteousnes, nor can discerne the honour of the soules that are faultles.}

23. {\cf2 For God created man without corruption, and made him after the image of his owne likenes.}

24. {\cf2 Neuertheles, thorowe enuie of the deuill came death into the world: and they that holde of his side, prooue it.}

## Tobit 3

1. {\cf2 Bvt the soules of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them.}

2. {\cf2 In the sight of the vnwise they appeared to die, and their end was thought grieuous,}

3. {\cf2 And their departing from vs, destruction, but they are in peace.}

4. {\cf2 And though they suffer paine before men, yet is their hope full of immortalitie.}

5. {\cf2 They are punished, but in fewe things, yet in many things shal they be wel rewarded: for God proueth them, & findeth them meete for him selfe.}

6. {\cf2 He tryeth them as the golde in the fornace, and receiueth them as a perfect fruite offering.}

7. {\cf2 And in the time of their vision they shall shine, and runne thorowe as the sparks among the stubble.}

8. {\cf2 They shall iudge the nations, and haue dominion ouer the people, and their Lord shal reigne for euer.}

9. {\cf2 They that trust in him shall vnderstand the trueth, and the faythfull shall remaine with him in loue: for grace and mercy is among his Saints, and he regardeth his elect.}

10. {\cf2 But the vngodly shalbe punished according to their imaginations: for they haue despised the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.}

11. {\cf2 Who so despiseth wisdome and discipline, is miserable, and their hope is vaine, and their labours are foolish, and their workes vnprofitable:}

12. {\cf2 Their wiues are vndiscreete, and their children wicked: their offering is cursed.}

13. {\cf2 Therefore the barren is blessed which is vndefiled, and knoweth not the sinfull bed: she shal haue fruite in the visitation of the soules,}

14. {\cf2 And the eunuch, which with his hands hath not wrought iniquitie, nor imagined wicked things against God: for vnto him shalbe giuen the speciall gift of fayth, & an acceptable portion in the Temple of the Lord.}

15. {\cf2 For glorious is the fruite of good labours, and the roote of wisdome shall neuer fade away.}

16. {\cf2 But the children of adulterers shall not be partakers of the holy things, and the seede of the wicked bed shalbe rooted out.}

17. {\cf2 And though they liue long, yet shall they be nothing regarded, and their last age shalbe without honour.}

18. {\cf2 If they die hastely, they haue no hope, neither comfort in the day of tryall.}

19. {\cf2 For horrible is the end of the wicked generation.}

## Tobit 4

1. {\cf2 Better is barennes with vertue: for the memoriall thereof is immortall: for it is knowen with God and with men.}

2. {\cf2 When it is present, men take example thereat, and if it goe away, yet they desire it: it is alway crowned and triumpheth, and winneth the battell and the vndefiled rewardes.}

3. {\cf2 But the multitude of the vngodly which abound in children, is vnprofitable: and the bastard plants shall take no deepe roote, nor lay any fast foundation.}

4. {\cf2 For though they bud foorth in the branches for a time, yet they shalbe shaken with the winde: for they stand not fast, and through the vehemencie of the winde they shalbe rooted out.}

5. {\cf2 For the vnperfect branches shalbe broken, and their fruite shalbe vnprofitable and sowre to eate, and meete for nothing.}

6. {\cf2 For all the children that are borne of the wicked bed, shalbe witnes of the wickednes against their parents when they be asked.}

7. {\cf2 But though the righteous be preuented with death, yet shall he be in rest.}

8. {\cf2 For the honourable age is not that which is of long time, neither that which is measured by the number of yeeres.}

9. {\cf2 But wisdome is the gray heare, and an vndefiled life is the olde age.}

10. {\cf2 He pleased God, and was beloued of him, so that where as he liued among sinners, he translated him.}

11. {\cf2 He was taken away, least wickednesse shouldalter his vnderstanding, or deceit beguile his minde.}

12. {\cf2 For wickednes by bewitching obscureth the thinges that are good, and the vnstedfastnesse of concupiscence peruerteth the simple minde.}

13. {\cf2 Though he was soone dead, yet fulfilled hee much time.}

14. {\cf2 For his soule pleased God: therefore hasted he to take him away from wickednes.}

15. {\cf2 Yet the people see and vnderstand it not, and consider no such things in their heartes, howe that grace and mercie is vpon his Saintes, and his prouidence ouer the elect.}

16. {\cf2 Thus the righteous that is dead, condemneth the vngodly which are liuing: and the youth that is soone brought to an ende, the long life of the vnrighteous.}

17. {\cf2 For they see the ende of the wise, but they vnderstand not what God hath deuised for him, and wherefore the Lord hath preserued him in safetie.}

18. {\cf2 They see him and despise him, but the Lorde wil laugh them to scorne,}

19. {\cf2 So that they shall fall hereafter without honour, and shall haue a shame among the dead for euermore: for without any voice shal he burst them and cast them downe, & shake them from the fundations, so that they shalbe vtterly wasted, and they shalbe in sorow, and their memoriall shall perish.}

20. {\cf2 So they being afraide, shall remember their sinnes, and their owne wickednes shall come before them to conuince them.}

## Tobit 5

1. {\cf2 Then shall the righteous stande in great boldenesse before the face of such as haue tormented him, and taken away his labours.}

2. {\cf2 When they see him, they shall be vexed with horrible feare, and shall be amased for his wonderfull deliuerance,}

3. {\cf2 And shal change their minds, & sigh for griefe of minde, & say within theselues, This is he whom we sometime had in derision & in a parable of reproch.}

4. {\cf2 Wee fooles thought his life madnesse, and his ende without honour.}

5. {\cf2 Howe is hee counted among the children of God, and his portion is among the Saintes!}

6. {\cf2 Therefore wee haue erred from the way of trueth, and the light of righteousnes hath not shined vnto vs, & the sunne of vnderstading rose not vpo vs.}

7. {\cf2 Wee haue wearied our selues in the way of wickednesse and destruction, and wee haue gone through dangerous wayes: but we haue not knowen the way of the Lord.}

8. {\cf2 What hath pride profited vs? or what profite hath the pompe of riches brought vs?}

9. {\cf2 All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a poste that passeth bye}

10. {\cf2 As a ship that passeth ouer the waues of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither ye path of it in the floods:}

11. {\cf2 Or as a birde that flieth thorow in the ayre, and no man can see any token of her passage, but onely heare the noise of her wings beating the light winde, parting the aire through the vehemencie of her going, and fleeth on shaking her wings, whereas afterward no token of her way can be found:}

12. {\cf2 Or as when an arrow is shot at a marke, it parteth the aire, which immediately cometh together againe, so that a man canot know where it went thorow.}

13. {\cf2 Euen so we, assoone us we were borne, we began to drawe to our ende, & haue shewed no token of vertue, but are cosumed in our owne wickednes.}

14. {\cf2 For the hope of the vngodly is like the dust that is blowen away with the winde, & like a thinne fome that is scattered abroad with ye storme, & as the smoke, which is dispersed with the winde, and as the remembrance of him passeth, that tarieth but for a day.}

15. {\cf2 But the righteous shall liue for euer: their rewarde also is with the Lord, and the most High hath care of them.}

16. {\cf2 Therefore shall they receiue a glorious kingdome, and a beautifull crowne of the Lordes hande: for with his right hande shall hee couer them, and with his arme shall he defende them.}

17. {\cf2 He shal take his ielousie for armour, and shall arme the creatures to be reuenged of the enemies.}

18. {\cf2 He shall put on righteousnes for a brestplate, and take true iudgement in steade of an helmet.}

19. {\cf2 He wil take holines for an inuincible shielde.}

20. {\cf2 He will sharpen his fierce wrath for a sword, and the world shall fight with him against ye vnwise.}

21. {\cf2 Then shal the thunder boltes go streight out of the lightnings, and shall flee to the marke}

22. {\cf2 (5:21) As out of the bent bowe of the cloudes, and out of his anger that throweth stones, shall thicke haile be cast, and the water of the sea shalbe wroth against them, and the floods shall mightily ouerflowe.}

23. {\cf2 (5:22) And a mightie winde shall stande vp against them, & like a storme shall scatter them abroad. Thus iniquitie shal bring all the earth to a wildernes, and wickednes shal ouerthrow ye thrones of the mighty.}

## Tobit 6

1. {\cf2 Heare therefore, O ye Kings, and vnderstande: learne, ye that be iudges of the endes of ye earth.}

2. {\cf2 Giue eare, ye that rule the multitudes and glorie in the multitude of people.}

3. {\cf2 For the rule is giuen you of the Lorde, and power by the most High, which wil try your works, and search out your imaginations.}

4. {\cf2 Because that ye being officers of his kingdome haue not iudged aright, nor kept the Lawe, nor walked after the will of God,}

5. {\cf2 Horribly & suddenly wil he appeare vnto you: for an hard iudgement shall they haue that beare rule.}

6. {\cf2 For he that is most low is worthy mercie, but the mightie shalbe mightily tormented.}

7. {\cf2 For he that is Lord ouer all, wil spare no person, neither shall he feare any greatnes: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike,}

8. {\cf2 But for the mightie abideth the sorer triall.}

9. {\cf2 Vnto you therefore, O tyrants, doe I speake, that ye may learne wisdome, and not goe amisse.}

10. {\cf2 For they that keepe holines holily, shalbe holy, and they that are learned there, shall find a defence.}

11. {\cf2 Wherefore set your delite vpon my wordes and desire them, and ye shalbe instructed.}

12. {\cf2 Wisedome shineth and neuer fadeth away, and is easily seene of them that loue her, and found of such as seeke her,}

13. {\cf2 She preuenteth them that desire her, that she may first shewe her selfe vnto them.}

14. {\cf2 Who so awaketh vnto her betimes, shal haue no great trauaile: for hee shall finde her sitting at his doores.}

15. {\cf2 To thinke vpo her then is perfect vnderstading: and who so watcheth for her, shalbe soone wtout care.}

16. {\cf2 For she goeth about, seeking such as are meete for her, and sheweth herselfe cheerefully vnto them in the wayes, and meeteth them in euery thought.}

17. {\cf2 For the most true desire of discipline is her beginning: and the care of discipline is loue:}

18. {\cf2 And loue is the keeping of her lawes: and the keeping of ye lawes is the assurance of immortalitie:}

19. {\cf2 And immortalitie maketh vs nere vnto God.}

20. {\cf2 Therefore the desire of wisedome leadeth to the kingdome.}

21. {\cf2 If your delite be then in thrones, and scepters, O Kings of the people, honour wisdome, that ye may reigne for euer.}

22. {\cf2 Nowe I will tell you what wisedome is, and whence it commeth, and will not hide the mysteries from you, but wil seeke her out from the beginning of her natiuitie, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not keepe backe the trueth.}

23. {\cf2 Neither wil I haue to do with consuming enuie: for such a man shal not be partaker of wisdome.}

24. {\cf2 But the multitude of the wise is the preseruation of the world, and a wise King is the stay of the people.}

25. {\cf2 Be therefore instructed by my wordes, and ye shall haue profite.}

## Tobit 7

1. {\cf2 I my selfe am also mortall & a man like all other, and am come of him that was first made of the earth.}

2. {\cf2 And in my mothers wombe was I fashioned to be flesh in tenne moneths: I was brought together into blood of the seed of man, and by the pleasure that commeth with sleepe.}

3. {\cf2 And when I was borne, I receiued the common ayre, and fell vpon the earth, which is of like nature, crying & weeping at the first as all other do.}

4. {\cf2 I was nourished in swadling cloths, and with cares.}

5. {\cf2 For there is no King that had any other beginning of birth.}

6. {\cf2 All men then haue one entrance vnto life, and a like going out.}

7. {\cf2 Wherefore I prayed, and vnderstanding was giuen mee: I called, and the spirit of wisdome came vnto me.}

8. {\cf2 I preferred her to scepters and thrones, and counted riches nothing in comparison of her.}

9. {\cf2 Neither did I compare precious stones vnto her: for all gold is but a litle grauel in respect of her, and siluer shalbe counted but clay before her.}

10. {\cf2 I loued her aboue health and beautie, and purposed to take her for my light: for her light cannot be quenched.}

11. {\cf2 All good things therefore came to me together with her, & innumerable riches thorow her hands.}

12. {\cf2 So I was glad in all: for wisdome was the author thereof, and I knewe not that she was the mother of these things.}

13. {\cf2 And I learned vnfainedly, and communicated without enuie, and I do not hide her riches.}

14. {\cf2 For she is an infinite treasure vnto men, which who so vse, become partakers of the loue of God, and are accepted for the giftes of knowledge.}

15. {\cf2 God hath graunted me to speake according to my minde, and to iudge worthily of the thinges, that are giuen me: for he is the leader vnto wisdome, and the directer of the wise.}

16. {\cf2 For in his hand are both we and our wordes, and all wisdome, and the knowledge of the workes.}

17. {\cf2 For he hath giuen me the true knowledge of the things that are, so that I knowe how the worlde was made, and the powers of the elements,}

18. {\cf2 The beginning & the end, and the mids of the times: how the times alter, & the change of ye seasons,}

19. {\cf2 The course of ye yere, the situatio of the starres,}

20. {\cf2 The nature of liuing things, and the furiousnes of beastes, the power of the windes, and the imaginations of men, the diuersities of plantes, and the vertues of rootes.}

21. {\cf2 And all things both secret and knowen doe I knowe: for wisdome the worker of all things, hath taught me it.}

22. {\cf2 For in her is the Spirit of vnderstading, which is holy, ye only begotten, manifold, subtil, moueable, cleare, vndefiled, euident, not hurtfull, louing the good, sharpe, which cannot be letted, doing good,}

23. {\cf2 Courteous, stable, sure, without care, hauing all power, circumspect in all thinges, and passing through all, intellectuall, pure and subtil spirites.}

24. {\cf2 For wisdom is nimbler then all nimble things: she goeth thorowe and atteineth to all thinges, because of her purenesse.}

25. {\cf2 For she is the breth of the power of God, & a pure influence that floweth fro the glory of the Almighty: therfore can no defiled thing come vnto her.}

26. {\cf2 For she is the brightnesse of the euerlasting light, the vndefiled mirrour of the maiestie of God, and the image of his goodnesse.}

27. {\cf2 And being one, she can do all things, and remayning in her selfe, renueth all, and according to the ages shee entreth into the holy soules, and maketh them the friendes of God and Prophets.}

28. {\cf2 For God loueth none, if he dwel not with wisdom.}

29. {\cf2 For she is more beautifull then the sunne, and is aboue all the order of the starres, and the light is not to be compared vnto her.}

30. {\cf2 For night commeth vpon it, but wickednesse cannot ouercome wisdome.}

## Tobit 8

1. {\cf2 She also reacheth from one end to another mightily, and comely doeth she order all things.}

2. {\cf2 I haue loued her, & sought her fro my youth: I desired to marry her, such loue had I vnto her beauty.}

3. {\cf2 In that she is conuersant with God, it comendeth her nobilitie: yea, the Lord of all things loueth her.}

4. {\cf2 For she is the scholemystres of the knowledge of God, and the choser out of his workes.}

5. {\cf2 If riches be a possessio to be desired in this life, what is richer then wisdom, that worketh all things?}

6. {\cf2 For if prudencie worketh, what is it among all things, that worketh better then she?}

7. {\cf2 If a man loue righteousnes, her labours are vertuous: for she teacheth sobernes and prudencie, righteousnes and strength, which are the most profitable things that men can haue in this life.}

8. {\cf2 If a man desire great experience, she can tell the things that are past, & discerne things to come: she knoweth the subtilties of wordes, and the solution of darke sentences: she foreseeth the signes and wonders, or euer they come to passe, and the successe of seasons and times.}

9. {\cf2 Therefore I purposed to take her vnto my companie, knowing that shee would counsell mee good things, and comfort me in cares and griefes.}

10. {\cf2 For her sake shall I haue glorie among the multitude, and honour among the Elders though I be yong.}

11. {\cf2 I shalbe founde of sharpe iudgement, so that I shalbe marueilous in the sight of great men.}

12. {\cf2 When I hold my tongue, they shall abide my leysure: when I speake, they shall heare diligently,and if I talke much, they shall lay their hands vpon their mouth.}

13. {\cf2 Moreouer, by her I shall obtaine immortalitie, & leaue an euerlasting memoriall among them that come after me.}

14. {\cf2 I shall gouerne the people, and the nations shalbe subdued vnto me.}

15. {\cf2 Horrible tyrants shalbe afraide when they heare me: among the multitude I shalbe counted good, and mightie in battell.}

16. {\cf2 When I come home, I shall rest with her: for her company hath no bitternes, and her felowship hath no tediousnes, but mirth and ioy.}

17. {\cf2 Now when I considered these things by my selfe, and pondred them in mine heart, how that to be ioyned vnto wisdome is immortalitie,}

18. {\cf2 And great pleasure is in her friendship, and that in the workes of her hands are infinite riches, and that in the exercise of talking with her is prudencie, and glory by communing with her, I went about, seeking how I might take her vnto me.}

19. {\cf2 For I was a wittie childe, and was of a good spirite.}

20. {\cf2 Yea, rather being good, I came to an vndefiled body.}

21. {\cf2 Neuertheles, when I perceiued that I could not enioy her, except God gaue her (and that was a point of wisdome also, to know whose gift it was) I went vnto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I sayd,}

## Tobit 9

1. {\cf2 O God of Fathers, and Lorde of mercy, which hast made all things with thy worde,}

2. {\cf2 And ordeined man through thy wisdome, that he should haue dominion ouer the creatures which thou hast made,}

3. {\cf2 And gouerne the world according to equitie and righteousnes, and execute iudgement with an vpright heart.}

4. {\cf2 Giue me that wisdome, which sitteth by thy throne, & put me not out from among thy childre.}

5. {\cf2 For I thy seruant, & sonne of thine handmayd, am a feeble person, & of a short time, and yet lesse in ye vnderstanding of iudgement & the lawes.}

6. {\cf2 And though a man be neuer so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdome be not with him, he shalbe nothing regarded.}

7. {\cf2 Thou hast chosen me to be a King of thy people, and the iudge of thy sonnes and daughters.}

8. {\cf2 Thou hast commanded me to build a temple vpon thine holy Mount, & an altar in ye citie wherein thou dwellest, a likenes of thine holy Tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning,}

9. {\cf2 And thy wisdome with thee, which knoweth thy workes, which also was when thou madest the world, and which knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandements.}

10. {\cf2 Send her out of thine holy heauens, & send her from the throne of thy maiestie, that she may be with me, and labour, that I may knowe what is acceptable in thy sight.}

11. {\cf2 For she knoweth & vnderstandeth al things, and she shall leade me soberly in my workes and preserue me by her glory.}

12. {\cf2 So shall my workes be acceptable, and then shall I gouerne thy people righteously, & be meete for my fathers throne.}

13. {\cf2 For what man is he that can know ye counsel of God? or who can thinke what the wil of God is?}

14. {\cf2 For the thoughtes of mortall men are fearefull, and our forecastes are vncertaine,}

15. {\cf2 Because a corruptible body is heauy vnto the soule, and the earthly mansion keepeth downe the minde that is full of cares.}

16. {\cf2 And hardly can we discerne the things that are vpon earth, and with great labour finde we out the things which are before vs: who can then seeke out the things that are in heauen?}

17. {\cf2 Who can knowe thy counsell, except thou giue him wisdome, and send thine holy Spirit from aboue?}

18. {\cf2 For so the wayes of them which are vpon earth, are reformed, and men are taught the things that are pleasant vnto thee, and are preserued through wisdome.}

## Tobit 10

1. {\cf2 She preserued the first father of the world, that was formed, and kept him when he was created alone, and brought him out of his offence,}

2. {\cf2 And gaue him power to rule all things,}

3. {\cf2 But the vnrighteous in his wrath departed from her, and perished by killing his brother in his furie.}

4. {\cf2 For whose cause the earth was ouerflowen, but wisdome preserued it againe, gouerning the iust man by a litle wood.}

5. {\cf2 Moreouer, when the nations were ioyned in their malicious confederacies, she knew the righteous, & preserued him faultles vnto God, and kept him sure, because she loued him tenderly as a sonne.}

6. {\cf2 She preserued the righteous, when the vngodly perished, when he fled from the fire that fell downe vpon the fiue cities.}

7. {\cf2 Of whose wickednes the waste land that smoketh, yet giueth testimonie, and the trees that beare fruite that neuer commeth to ripenes: and for a remembrance of the vnfaithfull soule, there standeth a pillar of salte.}

8. {\cf2 For al such as regarded not wisdome, had not only this hurt, that they knew not the things which were good, but also left behinde them vnto men a memoriall of their foolishnes, so that in the things wherein they sinned, they can not lie hid.}

9. {\cf2 But wisdome deliuered them that serued her.}

10. {\cf2 When the righteous fled because of his brothers wrath, she led him the right way, shewed him the kingdome of God, gaue him knowledge of holy things, made him rich in his labours, and made his paines profitable.}

11. {\cf2 Against the couetousnes of such as defrauded him, she stood by him and made him rich.}

12. {\cf2 She saued him from the enemies, & defended him from them, that lay in waite, & she gaue him the price in a mightie battell, that he might know that the feare of God is stronger then all things.}

13. {\cf2 When the righteous was solde, she forsooke him not, but deliuered him from sinne: she went downe with him into the dungeon,}

14. {\cf2 And failed him not in the bands, till she had brought him the scepter of the realme, and power against those that oppressed him, and them that had accused him, she declared to be liars, and gaue him perpetuall glory.}

15. {\cf2 She deliuered the righteous people & faultles seede from the nations that oppressed them.}

16. {\cf2 She entred into the soule of the seruant of the Lord, and stood by him in wonders & signes against the terrible Kings.}

17. {\cf2 She gaue the Saints the rewarde of their labours, and led them foorth a marueilous way: on the day time she was a shadowe vnto them, and a light of starres in the night.}

18. {\cf2 She brought them thorow the red sea, and caried them through the great water:}

19. {\cf2 But she drowned their enemies, & brought them out of the bottome of the deepe.}

20. {\cf2 So the righteous tooke the spoyles of the vngodly, and praysed thine holy Name, O Lord, and magnified thy victorious hand with one accord.}

21. {\cf2 For wisdome openeth the mouth of the dombe, and maketh the tongues of babes eloquent.}

## Tobit 11

1. {\cf2 She prospered their workes in the hands of thine holy Prophet.}

2. {\cf2 They went through the wildernes that was not inhabited, and pitched their tentes in places where there lay no way.}

3. {\cf2 They stoode against their enemies, and were auenged of their aduersaries.}

4. {\cf2 When they were thirstie, they called vpon thee, & water was giuen them out of the hie rocke, and their thirst was quenched out of ye hard stone.}

5. {\cf2 For by the thinges whereby their enemies were punished, by the same were the Israelites helped in their neede.}

6. {\cf2 For in steade of a fountaine of running water, the enemies were troubled at the corrupt blood, which was to rebuke the commandement of the killing of the children, but thou gauest vnto thine owne abundance of water vnlooked for,}

7. {\cf2 Declaring by the thirst that was at that time how thou haddest punished thine aduersaries.}

8. {\cf2 For when they were tried and chastised with mercy, they knewe howe the vngodly were iudged and punished in wrath.}

9. {\cf2 For these hast thou exhorted as a father, and proued them: but thou hast condemned ye other as a righteous King, when thou didst examine them.}

10. {\cf2 Whether they were absent or present, their punishment was alike: for their griefe was double with mourning, & the remembrance of things past.}

11. {\cf2 For when they perceiued that through their torments good came vnto them, they felt the Lord.}

12. {\cf2 And seeing the things that came to passe, at the last they wondered at him, whom afore they had cast out, denyed and derided: for they had an other thirst then the iust.}

13. {\cf2 Because of the foolish deuices of their wickednes wherewith they were deceiued, & worshipped serpents, that had not the vse of reason, and vile beasts, thou sendedst a multitude of vnreasonable beasts vpon them for a vengeance, that they might know, that wherewith a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished.}

14. {\cf2 For vnto thine almightie hande, that made the world of naught, it was not vnpossible to send among them a multitude of beares, or fierce lyons,}

15. {\cf2 Or furious beasts newly created, & vnknowen which should breathe out blastes of fire, & cast out smoke as a tempest, or shoote horrible sparkes like lightnings out of their eyes.}

16. {\cf2 Which might not onely destroy them with hurting, but also kill them with their horrible sight.}

17. {\cf2 Yea, without these might they haue bene cast downe with one winde, being persecuted by thy vengeance, and scattered abroad through the power of thy Spirite: but thou hast ordered all things in measure, number and weight.}

18. {\cf2 For thou hast euer had great strength and might, and who can withstande the power of thine arme!}

19. {\cf2 For as the small thing that ye balances weigheth, so is the world before thee, and as a drop of the morning dewe, that falleth downe vpon the earth.}

20. {\cf2 But thou hast mercie vpon all for thou hast power of al things, & makest as though thou sawest not the sinnes of men, because they should amend.}

21. {\cf2 For thou louest all things that are, & hatest none of them whome thou hast made: for thou wouldest haue created nothing that thou hadst hated.}

22. {\cf2 And how might any thing endure, if it were not thy will? or how could any thing be preserued, except it were called of thee?}

23. {\cf2 But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, which art the louer of soules.}

## Tobit 12

1. {\cf2 For thine incorruptible spirit is in all things.}

2. {\cf2 Therfore thou chastenest them measurably that go wrong, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance of the things wherein they haue offended, that leauing wickednes, they may beleeue in thee, O Lord.}

3. {\cf2 As for those olde inhabitants of the holy land, thou diddest hate them.}

4. {\cf2 For they committed abominable workes, as sorceries and wicked sacrifices,}

5. {\cf2 And slaying of their owne children without mercy, & eating of ye bowels of mans flesh in banketing, where ye raging Priests shed abominable blood.}

6. {\cf2 And the fathers were the chiefe murtherers of the soules, destitute of all helpe, whome thou wouldest destroy by the hands of our fathers,}

7. {\cf2 That the land which thou louest aboue all other, might be a meete dwelling for the children of God.}

8. {\cf2 Neuertheles, thou sparedst them also as men, and sendedst the forerunners of thine hoste, euen hornets to destroy them by litle and litle,}

9. {\cf2 Not that thou wast vnable to subdue the vngodly vnto ye righteous in battel, or with cruell beasts, or with one rough word to destroy them together.}

10. {\cf2 But in punishing them by litle and litle, thou gauest them space to repent, knowing well, that it was an vnrighteous nation & wicked of nature, and that their thought could neuer be altered.}

11. {\cf2 For it was a cursed seede from the beginning: yet hast thou not spared them when they sinned, because thou fearedst any man.}

12. {\cf2 For who dare say, What hast thou done? Or who dare stand against thy iudgement? Or who dare accuse thee for the nations that perish, whome thou hast made? Or who dare stand against thee to reuenge the wicked men?}

13. {\cf2 For there is none other God but thou, that carest for all things, that thou mayest declare how that thy iudgement is not vnright.}

14. {\cf2 There dare neither King nor tyrant in thy sight require accounts of them whome thou hast punished.}

15. {\cf2 For so much then as thou are righteous thy selfe, thou orderest all things righteously, thinking it not agreeable to thy power to condemne him, that hath not deserued to be punished.}

16. {\cf2 For thy power is the beginning of righteousnesse, and because thou art Lorde of all things, it causeth thee to spare all things.}

17. {\cf2 When men thinke thee not to be of a perfit power, thou declarest thy power, and reprouest the boldnesse of the wise.}

18. {\cf2 But thou ruling the power, iudgest with equitie, and gouernest vs with great fauour: for thou maist shewe thy power when thou wilt.}

19. {\cf2 By such workes nowe hast thou taught thy people, that a man should be iust and louing, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope: for thou giuest repentance to sinners.}

20. {\cf2 For if thou hast punished the enemies of thy children that had deserued death with so great consideration, & requesting vnto them, giuing them time & place that they might change fro their wickednesse,}

21. {\cf2 With howe great circumspection wilt thou punish thine owne childre, vnto whose fathers thou hast sworne and made couenants of good promises?}

22. {\cf2 So when thou doest chasten vs, thou punishest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that when we iudge, we shoulde diligently consider thy goodnesse, and when we are iudged, we shoulde hope for mercie.}

23. {\cf2 Wherfore thou hast tormented ye wicked that haue liued a dissolute life by their own imaginatios.}

24. {\cf2 For they went astray very farre in the wayes of errour, and esteemed the beastes, which their enemies despised, for gods, being abused after the maner of children, that haue none vnderstanding.}

25. {\cf2 Therefore hast thou sent this punishment that they should be in derisio as childre without reason.}

26. {\cf2 But they that will not be reformed by those scornefull rebukes, shall feele the worthie punishment of God.}

27. {\cf2 For in those things when they suffered, they disdained, but in these whom they counted godly, when they sawe themselues punished by them, they all acknowledged the true God whom afore they had denied to knowe: therefore came extreme damnation vpon them.}

## Tobit 13

1. {\cf2 Svrely all men are vaine by nature, and are ignorant of God, and could not knowe him that is, by the good things that are seene, neither consider by the workes, the worke master.}

2. {\cf2 But they thought the fire, or the winde or the swift aire, or the course of the starres, or the raging water, or the lightes of heauen to be gouernours of the world, and gods.}

3. {\cf2 Though they had such pleasure in their beautie that they thought them gods, yet shoulde they haue knowen, howe much more excellent he is that made them: for the first authour of beautie hath created these things.}

4. {\cf2 Or if they marueiled at the power, and operation of the, yet should they haue perceiued thereby, howe much he that made these things, is mightier.}

5. {\cf2 For by the greatnesse of their beautie, and of the creatures, the Creator being compared with them, may be considered.}

6. {\cf2 But yet ye blame is lesse in these, that seeke God and would finde him, & yet peraduenture doe erre.}

7. {\cf2 For they goe about by his workes to seeke him, and are perswaded by the sight, because the things are beautifull that are seene.}

8. {\cf2 Howbeit they are not to be excused.}

9. {\cf2 For if they can know so much, that they can discerne the worlde, why doe they not rather finde out the Lord thereof?}

10. {\cf2 But miserable are they, and among the dead is their hope, that call them gods, which are the workes of mens hands, golde, and siluer, & the thing that is inuented by arte, & the similitude of beastes, or any vaine stone that hath bene made by the hand of antiquitie.}

11. {\cf2 Or as when a carpenter cutteth downe a tree meete for the worke, and pareth off all ye barke thereof cunningly, & by arte maketh a vessell profitable for the vse of life.}

12. {\cf2 And the things that are cut off from his worke, he bestoweth to dresse his meate to fill himselfe,}

13. {\cf2 And that which is left of these things, which is profitable for nothing (for it is a crooked piece of wood and full of knobbes) he carueth it diligently at his leasure, and according as he is expert in cunning, he giueth it a proportion, and facioneth it after the similitude of a man,}

14. {\cf2 Or maketh it like some vile beast, and straketh it ouer with red, and painteth it, and couereth euery spotte that is in it.}

15. {\cf2 And when he hath made a conuenient tabernacle for it, he setteth it in a wall, and maketh it fast with yron,}

16. {\cf2 Prouiding so for it, least it fall: for he knoweth that it cannot helpe it selfe, because it is an image, which hath neede of helpe.}

17. {\cf2 Then he prayeth for his goodes, and for his mariage & for children: he is not ashamed to speake vnto it, that hath no life.}

18. {\cf2 He calleth on him that is weake for health: he prayeth vnto him that is dead for life: he requireth him of helpe that hath no experience at all.}

19. {\cf2 And for his iourney, him that is not able to goe, and for gaine, and worke, and successe of his affaires he requireth furtherance of him, that hath no maner of power.}

## Tobit 14

1. {\cf2 Againe, another man purposing to saile, and intending to passe thorowe the raging waues, calleth vpon a stocke more rotten then the shippe that carieth him.}

2. {\cf2 For as for it, couetousnesse of money hath found it out, & the craftesman made it by cunning.}

3. {\cf2 But thy prouidence, O Father, gouerneth it: for thou hast made a way, euen in the sea, and a sure path among the waues,}

4. {\cf2 Declaring thereby, that thou hast power to helpe in all things, yea, though a man went to the sea without meanes.}

5. {\cf2 Neuerthelesse thou wouldest not, that the workes of thy wisdome should be vaine, & therfore doe men comit their liues to a small piece of wood, & passe ouer the stormie sea in a ship, and are saued.}

6. {\cf2 For in the olde time also when the proude giants perished, the hope of the worlde went into a ship which was gouerned by thine hand, and so left seede of generation vnto the world.}

7. {\cf2 For blessed is the tree whereby righteousnes commeth.}

8. {\cf2 But that is cursed that is made with hands, both it, and he that made it: he because he made it, and it being a corruptible thing, because it was called God.}

9. {\cf2 For the vngodly, and his vngodlinesse are both like hated of God: so truly the worke and he that made it, shall be punished together.}

10. {\cf2 Therefore shall there be a visitation for the idoles of the nations: for of the creatures of God they are become abomination, and stumbling blockes vnto the soules of men, and a snare for the feete of the vnwise.}

11. {\cf2 For the inuenting of idoles was the beginning of whoredome, and the finding of them is the corruption of life.}

12. {\cf2 For they were not from the beginning, neither shall they continue for euer.}

13. {\cf2 The vaine glory of men brought them into ye world: therefore shall they come shortly to an end.}

14. {\cf2 When a father mourned grieuously for his sonne that was taken away suddenly, he made an image for him that was once dead, whom nowe he worshippeth as a god, and ordeined to his seruants ceremonies and sacrifices.}

15. {\cf2 Thus by proces of time this wicked custome preuailed, and was kept as a lawe, and idoles were worshipped by the commandement of tyrants.}

16. {\cf2 As for those that were so farre off that men might not worship them presently, they did counterfeit the visage that was farre off, and made a gorgeous image of a King, whom they would honour, that they might by all meanes flatter him that was absent, as though he had bene present.}

17. {\cf2 Againe the ambition of the craftesman thrust forward the ignorant to increase the superstition.}

18. {\cf2 For he peraduenture willing to please a noble man, laboured with all his cunning to make the image of the best fashion.}

19. {\cf2 And so thorowe ye beautie of the worke the multitude was allured, and so tooke him nowe for a God, which a litle afore was but honored as a man.}

20. {\cf2 And this was the deceiuing of mans life, when men, being in seruitude, through calamitie and tyrannie ascribed vnto stones and stockes the name, which ought not to be communicate vnto any.}

21. {\cf2 Moreouer, this was not ynough for the that they erred in the knowledge of God: but where as they liued in great warres of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.}

22. {\cf2 For either they slewe their owne children in sacrifice, or vsed secret ceremonies, or raging dissolutenes by strange rites,}

23. {\cf2 And so kept neither life nor mariage cleane: but either one slewe another by treason, or els vexed him by adulterie.}

24. {\cf2 So were all mixt together, blood and slaughter, theft and deceit, corruption, vnfaithfulnesse, tumultes, periurie,}

25. {\cf2 Disquieting of good men, vnthankfulnesse, defiling of soules, changing of birth, disorder in mariage, adulterie and vncleannesse.}

26. {\cf2 For the worshipping of idoles that ought not to be named, is the beginning and the cause and the ende of all euill.}

27. {\cf2 For either they be mad when they be merie, or prophesie lyes, or liue vngodly, or els lightly forsweare themselues.}

28. {\cf2 For in so much as their trust is in the idoles, which haue no life, though they sweare falsely, yet they thinke to haue no hurt.}

29. {\cf2 Therefore for two causes shall they iustly be punished, because they haue an euill opinion of God, addicting them selues vnto idols, and because they sweare vniustly to deceiue, and despise holines.}

30. {\cf2 For it is not ye power of them by whom they sweare, but ye vengeance of them that sinne, which punisheth alwayes the offence of the vngodly.}

## Tobit 15

1. {\cf2 Bvt thou, O our God, art gracious and true, long suffering, and gouernest all things by mercie.}

2. {\cf2 Though we sinne, yet are we thine: for we knowe thy power: but we sinne not, knowing that we are counted thine.}

3. {\cf2 For to know thee, is perfite righteousnes, and to know thy power is the roote of immortalitie.}

4. {\cf2 For neither hath the wicked inuention of men deceiued vs, nor the vnprofitable labour of the painters, nor an image spotted with diuers colours.}

5. {\cf2 Whose fight stirreth vp the desire of the ignorant: so that he coueteth the forme that hath no life, of a dead image.}

6. {\cf2 They that loue such wicked things are worthie to haue such things to trust to, and they that make them, and they that desire them, and they that worship them.}

7. {\cf2 The potter also tempereth soft earth, and facioneth euery vessell with labour to our vse: but of the same clay he maketh both the vessels, that serue to cleane vses, and the contrary likewise: but whereto euery vessell serueth, the potter is ye iudge.}

8. {\cf2 So by his wicked labour he maketh a vaine God of the same clay: euen he, which a litle afore was made of earth himselfe, and within a litle while after goeth thither againe whence he was taken, when he shall make account for ye lone of his life.}

9. {\cf2 Notwithstanding he careth not for the labour he taketh, nor that his life is short, but he striueth with the goldsmithes, and siluersmithes, and counterfeiteth, the coppersmithes, and taketh it for an honour to make deceiueable things.}

10. {\cf2 His heart is ashes, & his hope is more vile then earth, & his life is lesse worthy of honour then clay.}

11. {\cf2 For he knoweth not his owne maker, that gaue him his soule, that had power and breathed in him the breath of life.}

12. {\cf2 But they count our life to be but a pastime, and our conuersation as a market, where there is gaine: for they say we ought to be getting on euery side, though it be by euill meanes.}

13. {\cf2 Nowe he that of earth maketh fraile vessels and images, knoweth himselfe to offend aboue all other.}

14. {\cf2 All the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subiection, are most vnwise, and more miserable then the very fooles.}

15. {\cf2 For they iudge all the idoles of the nations to be gods, which neither haue eye sight to see, nor noses to smell, nor eares to heare, nor fingers of handes to grope, and their feete are slowe to goe.}

16. {\cf2 For man made them, and he that hath but a borowed spirite, facioned them: but no man can make a God like vnto himselfe.}

17. {\cf2 For seeing he is but mortall himselfe, it is but mortall that he maketh with vnrighteous hands: he himselfe is better then they whom he worshippeth: for he liued, but they neuer liued.}

18. {\cf2 Yea, they worshipped beastes also, which are their most enemies, and which are the worst, if they be compared vnto others, because they haue none vnderstanding.}

19. {\cf2 Neither haue they any beautie to be desired in respect of other beastes: for they are destitute of Gods praise, and of his blessing.}

## Tobit 16

1. {\cf2 Therefore by such things they are worthily punished & tormented by ye multitude of beasts.}

2. {\cf2 In stead of the which punishment thou hast bene fauourable to thy people, and to satisfie their appetite, hast prepared a meat of a strange tast, euen quailes,}

3. {\cf2 To the intent that they that desired meat, by the things which were shewed & sent among them, might turne away their necessary desire, and that they, which had suffred penurie for a space, shoulde also feele a newe taste.}

4. {\cf2 For it was requisite, that they which vsed tyrannie, should fall into extreeme pouertie, and that to these onely it should be shewed, howe their enemies were tormented.}

5. {\cf2 For when the cruell fiercenes of the beasts came vpon them, & they were hurt with the stinges of cruell serpents,}

6. {\cf2 Thy wrath indured not perpetually, but they were troubled for a litle season, that they might bee reformed, hauing a signe of saluation, to remember the commandement of thy Lawe.}

7. {\cf2 For he that turned toward it, was not healed by the thing that he sawe, but by thee, O Sauiour of all.}

8. {\cf2 So in this thou shewedst our enemies, that it is thou, which deliuerest from all euill.}

9. {\cf2 For the biting of grashoppers and flies killed them, and there was no remedie found for their life: for they were worthy to be punished by such.}

10. {\cf2 But the teeth of the venemous dragos could not ouercome thy children: for thy mercy came to helpe them, and healed them.}

11. {\cf2 For they were pricked, because they should remember thy woordes, and were speedily healed, least they should fal into so deepe forgetfulnes, that they could not be called backe by thy benefite.}

12. {\cf2 For neither herbe nor plaster healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.}

13. {\cf2 For thou hast the power of life and death, and leadest downe vnto the gates of hell, & bringest vp againe.}

14. {\cf2 A man in deede by his wickednesse may slaie another: but when the spirite is gone foorth, it turneth not againe, neither can he cal againe the soule that is taken away.}

15. {\cf2 But it is not possible to escape thine hand.}

16. {\cf2 For the vngodly that woulde not knowe thee, were punished by the strength of thine arme, with strange raine and with haile, and were pursued with tempest, that they coulde not auoid, and were consumed with fire.}

17. {\cf2 For it was a wonderous thing that fire might doe more then water, which quencheth all things: but the world is the auenger of the righteous.}

18. {\cf2 For sometime was the fire so tame, that the beasts, which were sent against the vngodly, burnt not: and that, because they should see & know, that they were persecuted with the punishment of God.}

19. {\cf2 And sometime burnt the fire in the middes of the water aboue the power of fire, that it might destroy the generation of the vniust land.}

20. {\cf2 In the steade whereof thou hast fed thine owne people with Angels foode, and sent them bread readie from heauen without their labour, which had aboundance of al pleasures in it and was meete for all tastes.}

21. {\cf2 For thy sustenance declared thy sweetenesse vnto thy children, which serued to the appetite of him, that tooke it, and was meete to that that euery man would.}

22. {\cf2 Moreouer the snowe and yee abode the fire and melted not, that they might know, that the fire burning in the haile, and sparkeling in the raine, destroied the fruite of the enemies.}

23. {\cf2 Againe it forgate his owne strength, that the righteous might be nourished.}

24. {\cf2 For the creature that serueth thee which art the maker, is fierce in punishing the vnrighteous: but it is easie to doe good vnto such as put their trust in thee.}

25. {\cf2 Therefore was it changed at the same time vnto all facions to serue thy grace, which nourisheth all things, according to the desire of them that had neede thereof,}

26. {\cf2 That thy children whome thou louest, O Lorde, might knowe, that it is not the increase of fruites that feedeth men, but that it is thy woorde, which preserueth them that trust in thee.}

27. {\cf2 For that which coulde not be destroied with the fire, being onely warmed a little with the sunne beames, melted,}

28. {\cf2 That it might bee knowen that we ought to preuent the sunne rising to giue thanks vnto thee, and to salute thee before the day spring.}

29. {\cf2 For the hope of the vnthankfull shall melt as the winter yce, and flowe away as vnprofitable waters.}

## Tobit 17

1. {\cf2 For thy iudgements are great, and can not be expressed: therefore men doe erre, that will not be reformed.}

2. {\cf2 For when the vnrighteous thought to haue thine holy people in subiection, they were bounde with the bandes of darkenesse, and long night, and being shut vp vnder the roofe, did lie there to escape the euerlasting prouidence.}

3. {\cf2 And while they thought to bee hid in their darke sinnes, they were scattered abroade in the darke couering of forgetfulnesse, fearing horribly and troubled with visions.}

4. {\cf2 For the denne that hid them, kept them not from feare: but the soundes that were about them, troubled them, and terrible visions and sorowfull sightes did appeare.}

5. {\cf2 No power of the fire might giue light, neither might the cleare flames of the starres lighten the horrible night.}

6. {\cf2 For there appeared vnto them only a sudden fire, very dreadfull: so that being afraide of this vision, which they coulde not see, they thought the things, which they sawe, to be worse.}

7. {\cf2 And the illusions of the magical artes were brought downe, & it was a most shamefull reproch for the boasting of their knowledge.}

8. {\cf2 For they that promised to driue away feare and trouble from the sicke person, were sicke for feare, and worthy to be laughed at.}

9. {\cf2 And though no fearful thing did feare them, yet were they afraide at the beasts which passed by them, and at the hissing of the serpents: so that they died for feare, and sayd they saw not the aire, which by no meanes can be auoided.}

10. {\cf2 For it is a feareful thing, when malice is condemned by her owne testimonie: and a conscience that is touched, doeth euer forecast cruell things.}

11. {\cf2 For feare is nothing els, but a betraying of the succours, which reason offreth.}

12. {\cf2 And the lesse that the hope is within, the more doeth he esteeme the ignorance of the thing, that tormenteth him, great.}

13. {\cf2 But they that did endure the night that was intolerable, and that came out of the dungeon of hell, which is insupportable, slept the same sleepe,}

14. {\cf2 And sometimes were troubled with monstruous visions, and sometime they swooned, as though their owne soule should betraie them: for a sudden feare not looked for, came vpon them.}

15. {\cf2 And thus, whosoeuer fell downe, he was kept and shut in prison, but without chaines.}

16. {\cf2 For whether hee was an husband man, or a shepheard, or one that was set to worke alone, if he were taken, hee must suffer this necessitie, that hee could not auoide:}

17. {\cf2 (For with one chaine of darkenesse were they all bounde) whether it were an hissing winde, or a sweete song of the birdes among the thicke branches of the trees, or the vehemencie of hastie running water,}

18. {\cf2 Or a great noyse of the falling downe of stones, or the running of skipping beastes, that coulde not be seene, or the noise of cruell beastes, that roared, or the sounde that answereth againe in the holowe mountaines: these fearefull thinges made them to swoone.}

19. {\cf2 For al the world shined with cleare light, and no man was hindred in his labour.}

20. {\cf2 Onely vpon them there fell an heauie night, an image of that darkenesse that was to come vpon them: yea, they were vnto themselues more grieuous then darkenesse.}

## Tobit 18

1. {\cf2 Bvt thy Saintes had a very great light, whose voyce because they heard, and sawe not the figure of them, they thought them blessed, because they also had not suffred the like.}

2. {\cf2 And because they did not hurt them, which did hurt them afore, they thanked them, and asked pardon for their enimitie,}

3. {\cf2 Therefore thou gauest them a burning pillar of fire to leade them in the vnknowen way, and madest the sunne that it hurted not them in their honourable iourney.}

4. {\cf2 But they were worthy to be depriued of the light, and to be kept in darkenesse, which had kept thy children shut vp, by whom the vncorrupt light of the Lawe should be giuen to the world.}

5. {\cf2 Whereas they thought to slay the babes of the Saints, by one childe that was cast out, and preserued to reprooue them, thou hast taken away the multitude of their children and destroied them all together in the mightie water.}

6. {\cf2 Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that they knowing vnto what othes they had giuen credite, might be of good cheere.}

7. {\cf2 Thus thy people receiued the health of the righteous, but the enemies were destroied.}

8. {\cf2 For as thou hast punished the enemies, so hast thou glorified vs whome thou hast called.}

9. {\cf2 For the righteous children of the good men offred secretely, and made a Lawe of righteousnesse by one consent, that the Saintes shoulde receiue good and euill in like maner, and that the fathers should first sing praises.}

10. {\cf2 But a disagreeing crie was hearde of the enemies, and there was a lamentable noise for the children that were bewailed.}

11. {\cf2 For the maister and the seruant were punished with like punishment, and the common people suffred alike with the King.}

12. {\cf2 So they all together had innumerable that died with one kinde of death: neither were ye liuing sufficient to burie them: for in the twinckling of an eye the noblest offspring of them was destroied.}

13. {\cf2 So they that could beleeue nothing, because of ye inchantments, confessed this people to be the children of God, in the destruction of ye first borne:}

14. {\cf2 For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the middest of her swift course,}

15. {\cf2 Thine almighty woorde leapt downe from heauen out of thy royall throne, as a fierce man of warre in the middes of the lande that was destroied,}

16. {\cf2 And brought thine vnfained commaundement as a sharpe sworde, and stoode vp and filled all thinges with death, and being come downe to the earth, it reached vnto the heauens.}

17. {\cf2 Then the sight of the fearefull dreames vexed them suddenly, and fearefulnes came vpon them vnawares.}

18. {\cf2 Then lay there one here, another there halfe dead, and shewed the cause of his death.}

19. {\cf2 For the visios that vexed them, shewed them these things afore: so that they were not ignorant, wherefore they perished.}

20. {\cf2 Nowe tentation of death touched the righteous also, and among the multitude in the wildernesse there was a plague, but the wrath indured not long.}

21. {\cf2 For the blameles man made haste, and defended them, and tooke the weapons of his ministration, euen prayer, and the reconciliation by the perfume, and set himselfe against the wrath, and so brought the miserie to an ende, declaring that hee was thy seruaunt.}

22. {\cf2 For he ouercame not the multitude with bodily power, nor with force of weapons, but with the word he subdued him that punished, alleadging the othes and couenant made vnto the fathers.}

23. {\cf2 For when the dead were fallen downe by heapes one vpon another, hee stoode in the middes, and cut off the wrath, and parted it from comming to the liuing.}

24. {\cf2 For in the long garment was all the ornament, and in the foure rowes of the stones was the glory of the fathers grauen with thy maiestie in the diademe of his head.}

25. {\cf2 Vnto these the destroier gaue place, and was afraide of them: for it was sufficient, that they had tasted the wrath.}

## Tobit 19

1. {\cf2 As for the vngodly, the wrath came vpon them without mercy vnto the ende: for hee knewe what should come vnto them,}

2. {\cf2 That they, (when they had consented to let them goe, and had sent them out with diligence) would repent, and pursue them.}

3. {\cf2 For while yet sorowe was before them, and they lamented by the graues of the dead, they deuised another foolishnesse, so that they persecuted them in their fleeing, whome they had cast out afore with praier.}

4. {\cf2 For the destinie, whereof they were worthy, brought them to this ende, and caused them toforget the things that had come to passe, that they might accomplish the punishment, which remained by torments,}

5. {\cf2 Both that thy people might trie a marueilous passage, and that these might finde a strange death.}

6. {\cf2 For euery creature in his kinde was facioned of newe, and serued in their owne offices inioyned them, that thy children might be kept without hurt.}

7. {\cf2 For the cloude ouershadowed their tentes, and the drye earth appeared, where afore was water: so that in the red sea there was a way without impediment, and the great deepe became a greene fielde.}

8. {\cf2 Through the which all the people went that were defended with thine hand, seeing thy wonderous marueiles.}

9. {\cf2 For they neyed like horses, and leaped like lambes, praysing thee, O Lord, which haddest deliuered them.}

10. {\cf2 For they were yet mindfull of those thinges which were done in the land where they dwelt, how the ground brought forth flyes, in steade of cattell, and howe the riuer scrauled with the multitude of frogges in steade of fishes.}

11. {\cf2 But at the last they sawe a newe generation of birdes, when they were intised with lust, and desired delicate meates.}

12. {\cf2 For the quailes came foorth of the sea vnto them for comfort, but punishments came vpon the sinners not without signes that were giuen by great thundrings: for they suffered worthily according to their wickednesse, because they shewed a cruell hatred toward strangers.}

13. {\cf2 For ye one sort would not receiue them when they were present, because they knewe them not: the other sort brought the strangers into bondage that had done them good.}

14. {\cf2 Beside all these things some would not suffer, that any regarde shoulde be had of them: For they handled the strangers despitefully.}

15. {\cf2 Others that had receiued them with great banketting, and admitted them to be partakers of the same lawes, did afflict them with great labours.}

16. {\cf2 Therefore they were stricken with blindnes, as in olde time certeine were at the doores of the righteous, so that euery one being compassed with darknesse, sought the entrance of his doore.}

17. {\cf2 Thus the elements agreed among themselues in this change, as when one tune is changed vpon an instrument of musike, and the melodie still remaineth, which may easily be perceiued by the sight of the things that are come to passe.}

18. {\cf2 For the things of the earth were changed into things of the water, and the thing that did swimme went vpon the ground.}

19. {\cf2 The fire had power in the water contrary vnto his owne vertue, and the water forgate his owne kinde to quench.}

20. {\cf2 Againe, the flames did not hurt ye flesh of the corruptible beasts that walked therein, neither melted they that which seemed to be yce, & was of a nature that would melt, and yet was an immortall meate.}

21. {\cf2 For in all things, O Lord, thou hast magnified and glorified thy people, and hast not despised to assist them in euery time and place.}
