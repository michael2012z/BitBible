## Luke 1

1. Forasmuch as 

2. 
          

3. It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things 

4. That thou mightest 

5. There 

6. And they were both 

7. And they had no childe, because that Elisabet was barren: and both were well stricken in age.

8. And it came to passe, as he executed the Priestes office before God, as his course came in order,

9. According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the 

10. And the whole multitude of the people were without in prayer, while the incense was burning.

11. Then appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lorde standing at the right side of the altar of incense.

12. And when Zacharias sawe him, he was troubled, and feare fell vpon him.

13. But the Angel saide vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wise Elisabet shall beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Iohn.

14. And thou shalt haue ioy and gladnes, and many shall reioyce at his birth.

15. For he shall be great in the 

16. And many of the children of Israel shall he 

17. And he shall go 

18. Then Zacharias said vnto ye Angel, Whereby shall I knowe this? For I am an olde man, and my wife is of a great age.

19. And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, 

20. And beholde, thou shalt be domme, & not be able to speake, vntill the day that these things be done, because thou beleeuedst not my words, which shalbe fulfilled in their season.

21. Now the people waited for Zacharias, and marueiled that he taried so long in the Temple.

22. And when hee came out, hee coulde not speake vnto them: then they perceiued that hee had seene a vision in the Temple: For he made signes vnto them, and remained domme.

23. And it came to passe, when the daies of his office were fulfilled, that he departed to his owne house.

24. And after those daies, his wife Elisabet conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying,

25. Thus hath the Lorde dealt with me, in the daies wherein he looked on me, to take from me my rebuke among men.

26. 
          

27. To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the 

28. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, [thou that art] 

29. And when she saw [him], she was 

30. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast 

31. For loe, thou shalt conceiue in thy wobe, and beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus.

32. He shall be great, and shall be 

33. And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome shall bee none ende.

34. Then said Mary unto the angel, 

35. And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost 

36. And, behold, thy 

37. For with God shall nothing be vnpossible.

38. Then Marie said, Behold the seruant of the Lord: be it vnto me according to thy woorde. So the Angel departed from her.

39. 
          

40. And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabet.

41. And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe 

42. And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and 

43. And whence commeth this to mee, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the babe sprang in my bellie for ioye,

45. And blessed is shee that beleeued: for those things shall be perfourmed, which were tolde her from the Lord.

46. 
          

47. And my spirite reioyceth in God my Sauiour.

48. For he hath 

49. Because hee that is mightie, hath done for me great things, and holy is his Name.

50. And his mercy [is] on them 

51. He hath shewed strength with his 

52. He hath 

53. He hath filled the 

54. 
          

55. As he 

56. And Marie abode with her about three moneths: after, shee returned to her owne house.

57. 
          

58. And her neighbours, and cousins heard tell howe the Lorde had shewed his great mercie vpon her, and they reioyced with her.

59. And it was so that on the eight day they came to circumcise the babe, and called him Zacharias after the name of his father.

60. But his mother answered, and saide, Not so, but he shalbe called Iohn.

61. And they saide vnto her, There is none of thy kindred, that is named with this name.

62. Then they made signes to his father, howe he would haue him called.

63. So hee asked for writing tables, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn, and they marueiled all.

64. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake and praised God.

65. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all 

66. And all they that heard [them] 

67. 
          

68. Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel; for he hath 

69. And hath raised up an 

70. As he spake by ye mouth of his holy Prophets, which were since the world began, saying,

71. That he would sende vs deliuerance fro our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate vs,

72. To perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and 

73. And the othe which he sware to our father Abraham.

74. Which was, that he would graunt vnto vs, that we being deliuered out of the handes of our enemies, should serue him without feare,

75. In holiness and righteousness 

76. And thou, 

77. To 

78. Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the 

79. To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the 

80. And the childe grewe, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the wildernesse, til the day came that he should shewe him selfe vnto Israel.

## Luke 2

1. And 

2. (This first taxing was made when Cyrenius was gouernour of Syria.)

3. Therefore went all to be taxed, euery man to his owne Citie.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the 

5. To bee taxed with Marie that was giuen him to wife, which was with childe.

6. And so it was, that while they were there, the daies were accomplished that shee shoulde be deliuered,

7. And she brought foorth her first begotten sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes, and laide him in a cratch, because there was no roome for them in the ynne.

8. 
          

9. And, lo, the angel of the Lord 

10. Then the Angel saide vnto them, Be not afraid: for behold, I bring you glad tidings of great ioy, that shalbe to all the people,

11. That is, that vnto you is borne this day in the citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is Christ the Lorde.

12. And this shalbe a signe to you, Yee shall finde the babe swadled, and laid in a cratch.

13. And suddenly there was with the angel 

14. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, 

15. And it came to passe whe the Angels were gone away from them into heauen, that the shepheards sayde one to another, Let vs goe then vnto Beth-leem, and see this thing that is come to passe which the Lord hath shewed vnto vs.

16. So they came with haste, and founde both Marie and Ioseph, & the babe laid in the cratch.

17. And when they had seene it, they published abroade the thing, that was tolde them of that childe.

18. And all that heard it, wondred at ye things which were tolde them of the shepheards.

19. But Mary kept all those sayings, and pondred them in her heart.

20. And the shepheardes returned glorifiyng and praising God, for all that they had heard and seene as it was spoken vnto them.

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. (As it is written in the Lawe of the Lorde, Euery man childe that first openeth ye wombe, shalbe called holy to the Lord)

24. And to giue an oblation, as it is commanded in the Lawe of the Lorde, a paire of turtle doues, or two yong pigeons.

25. 
          

26. And it was declared to him from God by the holy Ghost, that he shoulde not see death, before he had seene that Anointed of the Lord.

27. And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the 

28. Then hee tooke him in his armes, and praised God, and sayd,

29. Lord, now 

30. For 

31. Which thou hast prepared 

32. A light to be reueiled to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

33. And Ioseph and his mother marueiled at those things, which were spoken touching him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is 

35. (Yea, a sword shall 

36. 
          

37. And she was widowe about foure score and foure yeeres, and went not out of the Temple, but serued God with fastings & prayers, night and day.

38. She then coming at the same instant vpon them, confessed likewise the Lord, & spake of him to all that looked for redemption in Hierusalem.

39. And when they had performed all thinges according to the lawe of the Lorde, they returned into Galile to their owne citie Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, 

41. 
          

42. And when hee was twelue yeere olde, and they were come vp to Hierusalem, after the custome of the feast,

43. And had finished the dayes thereof, as they returned, the childe Iesus remained in Hierusalem, and Ioseph knew not, nor his mother,

44. But they supposing, that he had bene in the company, went a dayes iourney, and sought him among their kinsfolke, and acquaintance.

45. And when they found him not, they turned backe to Hierusalem, and sought him.

46. And it came to passe three dayes after, that they found him in the Temple, sitting in the mids of the doctours, both hearing them, and asking them questions:

47. And all that heard him, were astonied at his vnderstanding and answeres.

48. 
          

49. Then said he vnto them, Howe is it that ye sought me? knewe ye not that I must goe about my Fathers busines?

50. But they vnderstoode not the word that he spake to them.

51. 
          

52. And Iesus increased in wisedome, and stature, and in fauour with God and men.

## Luke 3

1. Now 

2. 
          

3. And hee came into all the coastes about Iordan, preaching the baptisme of repentance for the remission of sinnes,

4. As it is written in the booke of the sayings of Esaias the Prophet, which saith, The voyce of him that crieth in the wildernes is, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make his paths straight.

5. Euery valley shalbe filled, and euery mountaine and hill shall be brought lowe, and crooked things shalbe made straight, and the rough wayes shalbe made smoothe.

6. And all flesh shall see the saluation of God.

7. Then said he to the people that were come out to be baptized of him, O generations of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring foorth therefore fruites worthy amendement of life, and beginne not to say with your selues, We haue Abraham to our father: for I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.

9. Nowe also is the axe layed vnto the roote of the trees: therefore euery tree which bringeth not foorth good fruite, shalbe hewen downe, and cast into the fire.

10. Then the people asked him, saying, What shall we doe then?

11. And he answered, and said vnto them, He that hath two coates, let him part with him that hath none: and hee that hath meate, let him doe likewise.

12. Then came there Publicanes also to bee baptized, and saide vnto him, Master, what shall we doe?

13. And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is 

14. And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse [any] falsely; and be content with your 

15. 
          

16. Iohn answered, and saide to them all, In deede I baptize you with water, but one stronger then I, commeth, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to vnloose: hee will baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.

17. 
          

18. Thus then exhorting with many other things, he preached vnto the people.

19. 
          

20. He added yet this aboue all, that he shut vp Iohn in prison.

21. 
          

22. And the holy Ghost came downe in a bodily shape like a doue, vpon him, and there was a voyce from heauen, saying, Thou art my beloued Sonne: in thee I am well pleased.

23.

## Luke 4

1. And 

2. And was there fourtie dayes tempted of the deuil, & in those dayes he did eate nothing: but when they were ended, he afterward was hungry.

3. 
          

4. But Iesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not liue by bread only, but by euery word of God.

5. Then the deuill tooke him vp into an high mountaine, and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world, in the twinkeling of an eye.

6. And the devil said unto him, All this 

7. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be 

8. But Iesus answered him, and saide, Hence from mee, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him alone thou shalt serue.

9. Then hee brought him to Hierusalem, and set him on a pinacle of the Temple, and said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe from hence,

10. For it is written, That hee will giue his Angels charge ouer thee to keepe thee:

11. And with their handes they shall lift thee vp, least at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone.

12. And Iesus answered, and said vnto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

13. And when the deuil had ended all the tentation, he departed from him for a litle season.

14. And Iesus returned by the power of the spirite into Galile: and there went a fame of him throughout all the region round about.

15. For he taught in their Synagogues, and was honoured of all men.

16. 
          

17. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had 

18. The Spirit of the Lorde is vpon mee, because he hath anoynted me, that I should preach the Gospel to the poore: he hath sent mee, that I should heale the broken hearted, that I should preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, that I should set at libertie them that are bruised:

19. And that I should preache the acceptable yeere of the Lord.

20. And hee closed the booke, and gaue it againe to the minister, and sate downe: and the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him.

21. Then he began to say vnto them, This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your eares.

22. 
          

23. Then he said vnto them, Ye will surely say vnto mee this prouerbe, Physician, heale thy selfe: whatsoeuer we haue heard done in Capernaum, doe it here likewise in thine owne countrey.

24. And he saide, Verely I say vnto you, No Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey.

25. But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the 

26. But vnto none of them was Elias sent, saue into Sarepta, a citie of Sidon, vnto a certaine widowe.

27. Also many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Eliseus the Prophet: yet none of them was made cleane, sauing Naaman the Syrian.

28. 
          

29. And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, and led him vnto the edge of the hil, whereon their citie was built, to cast him downe headlong.

30. But he passed through the middes of them, and went his way,

31. And came downe into Capernaum a citie of Galile, and there taught them on the Sabbath dayes.

32. And they were astonied at his doctrine: for his worde was with authoritie.

33. And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, which cryed with a loude voyce,

34. 
          

35. And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. Then the deuill throwing him in the middes of them, came out of him, and hurt him nothing at all.

36. So feare came on them all, and they spake among themselues, saying, What thing is this: for with authoritie and power he commaundeth the foule spirits, and they come out?

37. And ye fame of him spred abroad throughout all the places of the countrey round about.

38. 
          

39. Then he stoode ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, and it left her, and immediatly she arose, and ministred vnto them.

40. Now at the sunne setting, all they that had sicke folkes of diuers diseases, brought them vnto him, and he layd his hands on euery one of them, and healed them.

41. 
          

42. 
          

43. But he sayd vnto them, Surely I must also preach the kingdome of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent.

44. And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile.

## Luke 5

1. And 

2. And sawe two shippes stand by the lakes side, but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nettes.

3. And he entred into one of the ships, which was Simons, & required him that he would thrust off a litle from the land: and he sate downe, and taught the people out of the ship.

4. Now when he had left speaking, he sayd vnto Simon, Lanch out into the deepe, and let downe your nettes to make a draught.

5. And Simon answering said unto him, 

6. And when they had so done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, so that their net brake.

7. And they beckened to their parteners, which were in the other ship, that they shoulde come and helpe them, who came then, and filled both the ships, that they did sinke.

8. Now when Simon Peter saw it, he fel down at Iesus knees, saying, Lord, go from me: for I am a sinfull man.

9. For he was vtterly astonied, and all that were with him, for the draught of fishes which they tooke.

10. And so was also Iames & Iohn the sonnes of Zebedeus, which were companions with Simon. Then Iesus sayde vnto Simon, Feare not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

11. And when they had brought the ships to land, they forsooke all, and followed him.

12. 
          

13. So he stretched forth his hand, & touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleane; immediately the leprosie departed from him.

14. And he commaunded him that hee should tell it no man: but Go, sayth he, and shew thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing, as Moses hath commanded, for a witnes vnto them.

15. 
          

16. But he kept himselfe apart in the wildernes, and prayed.

17. 
          

18. Then beholde, men brought a man lying in a bed, which was taken with a palsie, and they sought meanes to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

19. And when they could not finde by what way they might bring him in, because of the preasse, they went vp on the house, and let him downe through the tyling, bed and all, in the middes before Iesus.

20. And when he sawe their faith, he sayd vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.

21. Then the Scribes & the Pharises began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely?

22. But when Iesus perceiued their reasoning, he answered, and sayd vnto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

23. Whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, or to say, Rise and walke?

24. But that ye may know that that Sonne of man hath authoritie to forgiue sinnes in earth, (he sayd vnto the sicke of the palsie) I say to thee, Arise: take vp thy bed, and goe to thine house.

25. And immediatly he rose vp before them, and tooke vp his bed whereon he lay, and departed to his owne house, praysing God.

26. And they were all amased, & praysed God, and were filled with feare, saying, Doutlesse we haue seene strange things to day.

27. 
          

28. And he left all, rose vp, and folowed him.

29. Then Leui made him a great feast in his owne house, where there was a great company of Publicanes, and of other that sate at table with them.

30. But they that were Scribes and Pharises among them, murmured against his disciples, saying, Why eate ye and drinke ye with Publicanes and sinners?

31. Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, They that are whole, neede not the Physician, but they that are sicke.

32. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

33. 
          

34. 
          

35. But the dayes will come, euen when the bridegrome shalbe taken away from them: then shall they fast in those dayes.

36. Againe he spake also vnto them a parable, No man putteth a piece of a newe garment into an olde vesture: for then the newe renteth it, and the piece taken out of the newe, agreeth not with the olde.

37. Also no man powreth newe wine into olde vessels: for then ye new wine wil breake the vessels, and it will runne out, and the vessels will perish:

38. But newe wine must be powred into newe vessels: so both are preserued.

39. Also no man that drinketh olde wine, straightway desireth newe: for he sayth, The olde is more profitable.

## Luke 6

1. And 

2. And certaine of the Pharises sayde vnto them, Why doe ye that which is not lawfull to doe on the Sabbath dayes?

3. Then Iesus answered them, and said, Haue ye not read this, that Dauid did when he himselfe was an hungred, and they which were with him,

4. Howe he went into the house of God, and tooke, and ate the shewbread, and gaue also to them which were with him, which was not lawful to eate, but for the Priests onely?

5. And he sayd vnto them, The Sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath day.

6. 
          

7. And the Scribes & Pharises watched him, whether he would heale on the Sabbath day, that they might finde an accusation against him.

8. But he knew their thoughts, and sayd to the man which had the withered hand, Arise, and stand vp in the middes; hee arose, and stoode vp.

9. Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to 

10. And he behelde them all in compasse, and sayd vnto the man, Stretch forth thine hand; he did so, and his hand was restored againe, as whole as the other.

11. Then they were filled full of madnes, and communed one with another, what they might doe to Iesus.

12. 
          

13. And when it was day, he called his disciples, and of them he chose twelue which also he called Apostles.

14. (Simon whome he named also Peter, and Andrewe his brother, Iames and Iohn, Philippe and Bartlemewe:

15. Matthewe and Thomas: Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelous,

16. Iudas Iames brother, and Iudas Iscariot, which also was the traitour.)

17. And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the 

18. And they that were vexed with foule spirits, and they were healed.

19. And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went vertue out of him, and healed them all.

20. 
          

21. Blessed are ye that hunger nowe: for ye shalbe satisfied: blessed are ye that weepe now: for ye shall laugh.

22. Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall 

23. Rejoice ye in that day, and 

24. But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have 

25. Wo be to you that are full: for ye shall hunger. Wo be to you that now laugh: for ye shal wayle and weepe.

26. Wo be to you when all men speake well of you: for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

27. 
          

28. Blesse them that curse you, and pray for them which hurt you.

29. And vnto him that smiteth thee on ye one cheeke, offer also the other: and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coate also.

30. Giue to euery man that asketh of thee: and of him that taketh away the things that be thine, aske them not againe.

31. And as ye would that men should doe to you, so doe ye to them likewise.

32. For if ye love them which love you, 

33. And if ye do good for them which do good for you, what thanke shall ye haue? for euen the sinners doe the same.

34. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiue, what thanke shall yee haue? for euen the sinners lend to sinners, to receiue the like.

35. But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, 

36. Be ye therefore mercifull, as your Father also is mercifull.

37. 
          

38. Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, 

39. 
          

40. The disciple is not aboue his master: but whosoeuer will be a perfect disciple, shall bee as his master.

41. 
          

42. Either howe canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou seest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? Hypocrite, cast out the beame out of thine owne eye first, and then shalt thou see, perfectly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye.

43. 
          

44. For euery tree is knowen by his owne fruite: for neither of thornes gather men figges, nor of bushes gather they grapes.

45. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth good, and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart bringeth foorth euill: for of the aboundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

46. But why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I speake?

47. 
          

48. He is like a man which built an house, and digged deepe, and layde the fundation on a rocke: and when the waters arose, the flood beat vpon that house, and coulde not shake it: for it was grounded vpon a rocke.

49. But hee that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that built an house vpon the earth without foundation, against which the flood did beate, and it fell by and by: and the fall of that house was great.

## Luke 7

1. Now 

2. And a certaine Ceturions seruant was sicke and readie to die, which was deare vnto him.

3. And when he heard of Iesus, hee sent vnto him the Elders of the Iewes, beseeching him that he would come, and heale his seruant.

4. So they came to Iesus, and besought him instantly, saying that hee was worthy that hee should doe this for him:

5. For he loueth, said they, our nation, and he hath built vs a Synagogue.

6. Then Iesus went with them: but when he was now not farre from the house, the Centurion sent friendes to him, saying vnto him, Lorde, trouble not thy selfe: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe:

7. Wherefore I thought not my selfe worthy to come vnto thee: but say the word, and my seruant shalbe whole:

8. For I likewise am a man set vnder authoritie, and haue vnder mee souldiers, and I say vnto one, Goe, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and hee commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth it.

9. When Iesus heard these things, he marueiled at him, and turned him, and said to the people, that followed him, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, no not in Israel.

10. And when they that were sent, turned backe to the house, they founde the seruant that was sicke, whole.

11. 
          

12. Nowe when hee came neere to the gate of the citie, behold, there was a dead man caried out, who was the onely begotten sonne of his mother, which was a widowe, and much people of the citie was with her.

13. And when the Lord sawe her, he had compassion on her, and said vnto her, Weepe not.

14. And he went and touched the coffin (and they that bare him, stoode still) and he said, Yong man, I say vnto thee, Arise.

15. And he that was dead, sate vp, and began to speake, and he deliuered him to his mother.

16. Then there came a feare on them all, and they glorified God, saying, A great Prophet is risen among vs, and God hath visited his people.

17. And this rumour of him went foorth throughout all Iudea, and throughout all the region round about.

18. 
          

19. So Iohn called vnto him two certaine men of his disciples, and sent them to Iesus, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or shall we waite for another?

20. And when the men were come vnto him, they said, Iohn Baptist hath sent vs vnto thee, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or shall we waite for another?

21. And 

22. And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Goe your wayes and shewe Iohn, what things ye haue seene and heard: that the blinde see, the halt goe, the lepers are cleansed, the deafe heare, the dead are raised, and the poore receiue the Gospel.

23. And blessed is hee, that shall not be offended in me.

24. 
          

25. But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft rayment? Beholde, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and liue delicately, are in Kings courtes.

26. But what went ye foorth to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say to you, and greater then a Prophet.

27. This is he of whom it is written, Beholde, I sende my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

28. For I say vnto you, there is no greater Prophet then Iohn, among them that are begotten of women: neuerthelesse, hee that is the least in the kingdome of God, is greater then he.

29. And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, 

30. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God 

31. 
          

32. They are like vnto litle children sitting in the market place, and crying one to another, and saying, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced: we haue mourned to you, and ye haue not wept.

33. For Iohn Baptist came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine: and ye say, He hath the deuil.

34. The Sonne of man is come, and eateth and drinketh: and ye say, Beholde, a man which is a glutton, and a drinker of wine, a friend of Publicanes and sinners:

35. But wisdome is iustified of all her children.

36. 
          

37. And beholde, a woman in the citie, which was a sinner, when she knewe that Iesus sate at table in the Pharises house, shee brought a boxe of oyntment.

38. And shee stoode at his feete behinde him weeping, and began to wash his feete with teares, and did wipe them with the heares of her head, and kissed his feete, and anoynted them with the oyntment.

39. 
          

40. 
          

41. There was a certaine lender which had two detters: the one ought fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie:

42. When they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them both: Which of them therefore, tell mee, will loue him most?

43. Simon answered, and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgaue most; he said vnto him, Thou hast truely iudged.

44. Then he turned to the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entred into thine house, and thou gauest mee no water to my feete: but she hath washed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the heares of her head.

45. Thou gauest me no kisse: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kisse my feete.

46. Mine head with oyle thou didest not anoint: but she hath anoynted my feete with oyntment.

47. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; 

48. And he saide vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.

49. And they that sate at table with him, began to say within themselues, Who is this that euen forgiueth sinnes?

50. And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; 

## Luke 8

1. And it came to passe afterwarde, that hee himselfe went through euery citie and towne, preaching and publishing the kingdome of God, and the twelue were with him,

2. And certaine women, which were healed of euill spirites, and infirmities, as Mary which was called Magdalene, out of whom went seuen deuils,

3. And Ioanna the wife of Chuza Herods steward, and Susanna, and many other which ministred vnto him of their substance.

4. 
          

5. A sower went out to sowe his seede, and as he sowed, some fell by the wayes side, and it was troden vnder feete, and the foules of heauen deuoured it vp.

6. And some fell on the stones, and when it was sprong vp, it withered away, because it lacked moystnesse.

7. And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprang vp with it, and choked it.

8. And some fell on good ground, and sprang vp, and bare fruite, an hundreth folde; as hee sayd these things, he cryed, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.

9. Then his disciples asked him, demaunding what parable that was.

10. And he said, Unto you it is given to know the 

11. The parable is this, The seede is the worde of God.

12. And they that are beside the way, are they that heare: afterward commeth the deuill, and taketh away the worde out of their hearts, least they should beleeue, and be saued.

13. But they that are on the stones, are they which when they haue heard, receiue ye word with ioy: but they haue no rootes: which for a while beleeue, but in the time of tentation goe away.

14. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, 

15. But that on the good ground are they, which in an 

16. 
          

17. For nothing is secret, that shall not be euident: neither any thing hid, that shall not be knowen, and come to light.

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. And it was tolde him by certaine which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, and would see thee.

21. But he answered, and sayd vnto them, My mother and my brethren are these which heare the worde of God, and doe it.

22. 
          

23. But as they sailed he fell 

24. Then they went to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we perish; he arose, and rebuked the winde, and the waues of water: and they ceased, and it was calme.

25. Then he sayde vnto them, Where is your fayth? And they feared, & wondered among them selues, saying, Who is this that commandeth both the windes and water, and they obey him!

26. So they sailed vnto the region of the Gadarenes, which is ouer against Galile.

27. 
          

28. And when he sawe Iesus, he cryed out and fell downe before him, and with a loude voyce sayd, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus the Sonne of God the most High? I beseech thee torment me not.

29. (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, 

30. Then Iesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he sayd, Legion, because many deuils were entred into him.

31. And they besought him, that he would not commaund them to goe out into the deepe.

32. And there was there by, an hearde of many swine, feeding on an hill: and the deuils besought him, that he would suffer them to enter into them. So he suffered them.

33. Then went the deuils out of the man, and entred into the swine: and the hearde was caried with violence from a steepe downe place into the lake, and was choked.

34. When the heardmen sawe what was done, they fled: and when they were departed, they tolde it in the citie and in the countrey.

35. Then they came out to see what was done, and came to Iesus, and found the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, sitting at the feete of Iesus, clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afrayd.

36. They also which saw it, tolde them by what meanes he that was possessed with the deuill, was healed.

37. Then the whole multitude of the countrey about the Gadarenes, besought him that he would depart from them: for they were taken with a great feare: and he went into the ship, and returned.

38. Then the man, out of whome the deuils were departed, besought him that hee might be with him: but Iesus sent him away, saying,

39. Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published 

40. And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people 

41. 
          

42. For he had but a daughter onely, about twelue yeeres of age, and she lay a dying (and as he went, the people thronged him.

43. And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her 

44. When she came behind him, she touched the hemme of his garment, and immediatly her yssue of blood stanched.

45. Then Iesus sayd, Who is it that hath touched me? When euery man denied, Peter sayd and they that were with him, Master, the multitude thrust thee, and tread on thee, & sayest thou, Who hath touched me?

46. And Iesus sayde, Some one hath touched me: for I perceiue that vertue is gone out of me.

47. When the woman sawe that she was not hid, she came trembling, and fell downe before him, and tolde him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediatly.

48. And he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath saued thee: go in peace.)

49. While he yet spake, there came one from the ruler of the Synagogues house, which sayde to him, Thy daughter is dead: disease not the Master.

50. When Iesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Feare not: beleeue onely, and she shall be saued.

51. And when he went into the house, he suffered no man to goe in with him, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and the father and mother of the maide.

52. And all wept, and 

53. And they laught him to scorne, knowing that she was dead.

54. So he thrust them all out, and tooke her by the hand, and cryed, saying, Maide, arise.

55. And her spirit came again, and she 

56. Then her parents were astonied: but hee commaunded them that they should tell no man what was done.

## Luke 9

1. Then 

2. And hee sent them foorth to preach the kingdome of God, and to cure the sicke.

3. And he sayd to them, Take nothing to your iourney, neither staues, nor scrip, neither bread, nor siluer, neither haue two coates apiece.

4. And whatsoever house ye enter into, there 

5. And howe many so euer will not receiue you, when ye goe out of that citie, shake off the very dust from your feete for a testimonie against them.

6. And they went out, & went through euery towne preaching the Gospel, and healing euery where.

7. 
          

8. And of some, that Elias had appeared: and of some, that one of the olde Prophets was risen againe.

9. Then Herod sayd, Iohn haue I beheaded: who then is this of whome I heare such things? And he desired to see him.

10. 
          

11. But when the people knewe it, they followed him: and he receiued them, and spake vnto them of the kingdome of God, and healed them that had neede to be healed.

12. And when the day began to weare away, the twelue came, and sayd vnto him, Sende the people away, that they may goe into the townes and villages round about, and lodge, & get meate: for we are here in a desart place.

13. But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; 

14. For they were about fiue thousand men. Then he sayde to his disciples, Cause them to sit downe by fifties in a company.

15. And they did so, and caused all to sit downe.

16. Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, 

17. So they did all eate, and were satisfied: and there was taken vp of that remained to them, twelue baskets full of broken meate.

18. 
          

19. They answered, and sayd, Iohn Baptist: and others say, Elias: and some say, that one of the olde Prophets is risen againe.

20. And he sayd vnto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered, and sayd, That Christ of God.

21. And he warned and commaunded them, that they should tell that to no man,

22. 
          

23. And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross 

24. For whosoeuer will saue his life, shal lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall saue it.

25. For what auantageth it a man, if he win the whole worlde, and destroy himselfe, or lose himselfe?

26. For whosoeuer shall be ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed, when hee shall come in his glorie, and in the glorie of the Father, and of the holy Angels.

27. And I tell you of a suretie, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the kingdome of God.

28. 
          

29. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was changed, and his garment was white and glistered.

30. And beholde, two men talked with him, which were Moses and Elias:

31. Who appeared in glory, and spake of his 

32. But Peter & they that were with him, were heauie with sleepe, and when they awoke, they saw his glorie, and the two men standing with him.

33. And it came to passe, as they departed fro him, Peter said vnto Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: let vs therefore make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias, and wist not what he said.

34. Whiles he thus spake, there came a cloude and ouershadowed them, and they feared when they were entring into the cloude.

35. And there came a voyce out of the cloud, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, heare him.

36. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept [it] close, and told no man in 

37. 
          

38. And beholde, a man of the companie cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, beholde my sonne: for he is all that I haue.

39. And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and 

40. Nowe I haue besought thy disciples to cast him out, but they could not.

41. Then Iesus answered, & said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, howe long now shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring thy sonne hither.

42. And whiles he was yet comming, the deuill rent him, and tare him: and Iesus rebuked the vncleane spirite, and healed the childe, and deliuered him to his father.

43. 
          

44. 
          

45. But they vnderstood not that word: for it was hid from them, so that they could not perceiue it: and they feared to aske him of that worde.

46. 
          

47. When Iesus sawe the thoughtes of their heartes, he tooke a litle childe, & set him by him,

48. And said vnto them, Whosoeuer receiueth this litle childe in my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer shall receiue me, receiueth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, he shall be great.

49. 
          

50. Then Iesus saide vnto him, Forbid ye him not: for he that is not against vs, is with vs.

51. 
          

52. And sent messengers before him: and they went and entred into a towne of the Samaritans, to prepare him lodging.

53. But they woulde not receiue him, because his behauiour was, as though he would go to Hierusalem.

54. 
          

55. But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of 

56. For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them. Then they went to another towne.

57. 
          

58. And Iesus saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of the heauen nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head.

59. 
          

60. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury 

61. 
          

62. And Iesus saide vnto him, No man that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backe, is apt to the kingdome of God.

## Luke 10

1. After 

2. And he said vnto them, The haruest is great, but the labourers are fewe: pray therefore the Lord of the haruest to sende foorth labourers into his haruest.

11. Euen the very dust, which cleaueth on vs of your citie, we wipe off against you: notwithstanding knowe this, that the kingdome of God was come neere vnto you.

12. For I say to you, that it shall be easier in that day for them of Sodom, then for that citie.

13. Woe be to thee, Chorazin: woe be to thee, Beth-saida: for if the miracles had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, which haue bene done in you, they had a great while agone repented, sitting in sackecloth and ashes.

14. Therefore it shall be easier for Tyrus, and Sidon, at the iudgement, then for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heauen, shalt be thrust downe to hell.

16. He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.

17. 
          

18. And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning 

19. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means 

20. Neuerthelesse, in this reioyce not, that the spirits are subdued vnto you: but rather reioyce, because your names are written in heauen.

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. For I tell you that many Prophets and Kings haue desired to see those things, which ye see, and haue not seene them: and to heare those things which ye heare, and haue not heard them.

25. 
          

26. And he saide vnto him, What is written in the Lawe? Howe readest thou?

27. And he answered, and saide, Thou shalt loue thy Lord God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, and with all thy thought, and thy neighbour as thy selfe.

28. Then he said vnto him, Thou hast answered right: this doe, and thou shalt liue.

29. 
          

30. And Iesus answered, and saide, A certaine man went downe from Hierusalem to Iericho, and fell among theeues, and they robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leauing him halfe dead.

31. Nowe so it fell out, that there came downe a certaine Priest that same way, and when he sawe him, he passed by on the other side.

32. And likewise also a Leuite, when he was come neere to the place, went and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

33. Then a certaine Samaritane, as he iourneyed, came neere vnto him, and when he sawe him, he had compassion on him,

34. And went to him, & bound vp his wounds, and powred in oyle and wine, and put him on his owne beast, and brought him to an Inne, and made prouision for him.

35. And on the morowe when he departed, he tooke out two pence, and gaue them to the hoste, and said vnto him, Take care of him, and whatsoeuer thou spendest more, when I come againe, I will recompense thee.

36. Which nowe of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues?

37. And he saide, He that shewed mercie on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe, and do thou likewise.

38. 
          

39. And she had a sister called Marie, which also sate at Iesus feete, and heard his preaching.

40. But Martha was combred about much seruing, and came to him, and saide, Master, doest thou not care that my sister hath left me to serue alone? bid her therefore, that she helpe me.

41. And Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Martha, Martha, thou carest, and art troubled about many things:

42. But one thing is needefull, Marie hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

## Luke 11

1. And so it was, that as he was praying in a certaine place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said vnto him, Lord, teache vs to pray, as Iohn also taught his disciples.

2. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, 

3. Give us 

4. And forgiue vs our sinnes: for euen we forgiue euery man that is indetted to vs: And leade vs not into temptation: but deliuer vs from euill.

5. 
          

6. For a friende of mine is come out of the way to me, & I haue nothing to set before him:

7. And hee within shoulde answere, and say, Trouble mee not: the doore is nowe shut, and my children are with mee in bed: I can not rise and giue them to thee.

8. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his 

9. And I say vnto you, Aske, and it shall be giuen you: seeke, and yee shall finde: knocke, and it shalbe opened vnto you.

10. For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: & to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened.

11. If a sonne shall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will he giue him a stone? Or if hee aske a fish, will he for a fish giue him a serpent?

12. Or if hee aske an egge, will hee giue him a scorpion?

13. If yee then which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto your children, howe much more shall your heauenly Father giue the holy Ghost to them, that desire him?

14. Then hee cast out a deuill which was domme: and when the deuill was gone out, the domme spake, and the people wondered.

15. 
          

16. And others tempted him, seeking of him a signe from heauen.

17. 
          

18. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils 

19. If I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whome doe your children cast them out? Therefore shall they be your iudges.

20. But if I with the 

21. When a strong man armed keepeth his 

22. But when a stronger then hee, commeth vpon him, and ouercommeth him: hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and deuideth his spoiles.

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

26. Then goeth hee, and taketh to him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe: and they enter in, and dwel there: so the last state of that man is worse then the first.

27. 
          

28. But hee saide, Yea, rather blessed are they that heare the woorde of God, and keepe it.

29. And when the people were gathered thicke together, he began to say, This is a wicked generation: they seeke a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen them, but the signe of Ionas the Prophet.

30. For as Ionas was a signe to the Niniuites: so shall also the Sonne of man bee to this generation.

31. The Queene of the South shall rise in iudgement, with the men of this generation, and shall condemne them: for shee came from the vtmost partes of the earth to heare the wisedome of Solomon, and beholde, a greater then Solomon is here.

32. The men of Niniue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas: and beholde, a greater then Ionas is here.

33. 
          

34. The light of the bodie is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, then is thy whole bodie light: but if thine eye be euill, then thy bodie is darke.

35. Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darkenesse.

36. If therefore thy whole body shall be light, hauing no part darke, then shall all be light, euen as when a candle doth light thee with the brightnesse.

37. 
          

38. And when the Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner.

39. And the Lord saide to him, In deede yee Pharises make cleane the outside of the cuppe, and of the platter: but the inwarde part is full of rauening and wickednesse.

40. Ye fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also?

41. But rather give alms 

42. 
          

43. 
          

44. 
          

45. 
          

46. And he sayde, Wo be to you also, yee Lawyers: for yee lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, and yee your selues touche not the burdens with one of your fingers.

47. 
          

48. Truly 

49. Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they shall slay and 

50. That the blood of all the prophets, which was 

51. From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which was slaine betweene the altar and the Temple: verely I say vnto you, it shall be required of this generation.

54. Laying wait for him, and seeking to catche some thing of his mouth, whereby they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. In 

2. For there is nothing couered, that shall not bee reueiled: neither hidde, that shall not be knowen.

3. Wherefore whatsoeuer yee haue spoken in darkenesse, it shall be heard in the light: and that which ye haue spoken in the eare, in secret places, shall be preached on the houses.

4. 
          

5. But I will 

6. Are not fiue sparowes bought for two farthings, and yet not one of them is forgotten before God?

7. Yea, and all the heares of your head are nombred: feare not therefore: yee are more of value then many sparowes.

8. 
          

9. But hee that shall denie mee before men, shall be denied before the Angels of God.

10. And whosoeuer shall speake a woorde against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but vnto him, that shal blaspheme ye holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen.

11. 
          

12. For the holy Ghost shall teache you in the same houre, what yee ought to say.

13. 
          

14. And he said vnto him, Man, who made me a iudge, or a deuider ouer you?

15. And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of 

16. 
          

17. And he 

18. And he said, This wil I do, I wil pul downe my barnes, and builde greater, and therein will I gather all my fruites, and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] 

20. But God said vnto him, O foole, this night wil they fetch away thy soule fro thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast prouided?

21. So [is] he that layeth up treasure 

22. 
          

23. The life is more then meate: and the body more then the raiment.

24. Consider the rauens: for they neither sowe nor reape: which neither haue storehouse nor barne, & yet God feedeth them: how much more are yee better then foules?

25. And which of you with taking thought, can adde to his stature one cubite?

26. If yee then bee not able to doe the least thing, why take yee thought for the remnant?

27. Consider the lilies howe they growe: they labour not, neither spin they: yet I say vnto you, that Solomon himselfe in all his royaltie was not clothed like one of these.

28. If then God so clothe the grasse which is to day in the field, and to morowe is cast into the ouen, howe much more will he clothe you, O yee of litle faith?

29. And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither 

30. For all such things the people of the world seeke for: and your Father knoweth that ye haue neede of these things.

31. 
          

32. 
          

33. 
          

34. For where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also.

35. 
          

36. And ye your selues like vnto men that waite for their master, when he will returne from the wedding, that when he commeth and knocketh, they may open vnto him immediatly.

37. Blessed are those seruants, whom the Lord when he commeth shall finde waking: verely I say vnto you, he will girde himselfe about, and make them to sit downe at table, and will come forth, and serue them.

38. And if he come in the seconde watch, or come in the third watch, and shall finde them so, blessed are those seruants.

39. Nowe vnderstand this, that if the good man of the house had knowen at what houre the theefe would haue come, he would haue watched, and would not haue suffered his house to be digged through.

40. 
          

41. Then Peter saide vnto him, Master, tellest thou this parable vnto vs, or euen to all?

42. And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give [them their] 

43. Blessed is that seruant, whom his master when he commeth, shall finde so doing.

44. Of a trueth I say vnto you, that he wil make him ruler ouer all that he hath.

45. But if that seruant say in his heart, My master doeth deferre his comming, and ginne to smite the seruants, and maydens, and to eate, and drinke, and to be drunken,

46. The master of that seruant will come in a day when he thinketh not, and at an houre when he is not ware of, and will cut him off, and giue him his portion with the vnbeleeuers.

47. And that seruant that knewe his masters will, and prepared not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes.

48. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes]. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask 

49. 
          

50. Notwithstanding I must be baptized with a baptisme, & how am I grieued, till it be ended?

51. Thinke ye that I am come to giue peace on earth? I tell you, nay, but rather debate.

52. For from hencefoorth there shall be fiue in one house deuided, three against two, and two against three.

53. The father shalbe deuided against ye sonne, and the sonne against the father: the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother: the mother in lawe against her daughter in lawe, and the daughter in lawe against her mother in lawe.

54. 
          

55. And when ye see the South winde blowe, ye say, that it wilbe hoate: & it commeth to passe.

56. Hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the earth, and of the skie: but why discerne ye not this time?

57. 
          

58. When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, [as thou art] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the 

59. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast payed the vtmost mite.

## Luke 13

1. There 

2. And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Suppose ye, that these Galileans were greater sinners then al the other Galileans, because they haue suffered such things?

3. I tell you, nay: but except ye amend your liues, ye shall all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in 

5. I tell you, nay: but except ye amend your liues, ye shall all likewise perish.

6. 
          

7. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why 

8. And he answered, and said vnto him, Lord, let it alone this yeere also, till I digge round about it, and doung it.

9. And if it beare fruite, well: if not, then after thou shalt cut it downe.

10. 
          

11. And, behold, there was a woman which had a 

12. And when Jesus saw her, he called [her to him], and said unto her, Woman, thou art 

13. And he laide his handes on her, and immediately she was made straight againe, and glorified God.

14. 
          

15. Then answered him the Lord, and said, Hypocrite, doth not eche one of you on the Sabbath day loose his oxe or his asse from the stall, & leade him away to the water?

16. And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, loe, eighteene yeeres, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?

17. And when he said these things, all his aduersaries were ashamed: but all the people reioyced at all the excellent things, that were done by him.

18. Then said he, What is the kingdome of God like? Or whereto shall I compare it?

19. 
          

20. And againe he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God?

21. It is like leauen, which a woman tooke, and hid in three peckes of floure, till all was leauened.

22. 
          

23. Then saide one vnto him, Lorde, are there fewe that shalbe saued? And he said vnto them,

24. Striue to enter in at the straite gate: for many, I say vnto you, will seeke to enter in, and shall not be able.

25. When the good man of the house is risen vp, and hath shut to the doore, and ye begin to stand without, and to knocke at the doore, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs, and he shall answere and say vnto you, I know you not whence ye are,

26. 
          

27. But he shall say, I tell you, I knowe you not whence ye are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquitie.

28. 
          

29. And they shall come from the 

30. And beholde, there are last, which shalbe first, and there are first, which shalbe last.

31. 
          

32. And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that 

33. 
          

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen [doth gather] her 

35. Beholde, your house is left vnto you desolate: and verely I tell you, ye shall not see me vntill the time come that ye shall say, Blessed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord.

## Luke 14

1. And 

2. And beholde, there was a certaine man before him, which had the dropsie.

3. Then Iesus answering, spake vnto the Lawyers and Pharises, saying, Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath day?

4. And they held their peace. Then he tooke him, and healed him, and let him goe,

5. And answered them, saying, Which of you shall haue an asse, or an oxe fallen into a pit, & wil not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day?

6. And they could not answere him againe to those things.

7. 
          

8. When thou shalt be bidden of any man to a wedding, set not thy selfe downe in the chiefest place, lest a more honourable man then thou, be bidden of him,

9. And he that bade both him & thee, come, and say to thee, Giue this man roome, and thou then begin with shame to take the lowest roome.

10. But when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roome, that when he that bade thee, cometh, he may say vnto thee, Friende, sit vp hier: then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at table with thee.

11. For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shall be brought lowe, and he that humbleth himselfe, shal be exalted.

12. 
          

13. But when thou makest a feast, call ye poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blind,

14. And thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the iust.

15. Nowe when one of them that sate at table, heard these things, he said vnto him, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdome of God.

16. Then saide he to him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many,

17. And sent his seruant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come: for all things are nowe readie.

18. 
          

19. And another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to proue them: I pray thee, haue me excused.

20. And another said, I haue maried a wife, and therefore I can not come.

21. So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the 

22. And the seruaunt saide, Lorde, it is done as thou hast commaunded, and yet there is roome.

23. Then the master sayd to the seruaunt, Goe out into the hie wayes, and hedges, and compell them to come in, that mine house may bee filled.

24. For I say vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper.

25. 
          

26. If any [man] come to me, and 

27. 
          

28. For which of you, intending to build a tower, 

29. Lest that after he hath laide the foundation, and is not able to performe it, all that behold it, begin to mocke him,

30. Saying, This man began to builde, and was not able to make an end?

31. Or what King going to make warre against another King, sitteth not downe first, and taketh counsell, whether he be able with ten thousande, to meete him that commeth against him with twentie thousand?

32. Or els while hee is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage, and desireth peace.

33. So likewise, whosoeuer hee be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

34. 
          

35. It is neither meete for the land, nor yet for the dunghill, but men cast it out. He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.

## Luke 15

1. Then drew near unto 

2. Therefore the Pharises and Scribes murmured, saying, Hee receiueth sinners, and eateth with them.

3. Then spake hee this parable to them, saying,

4. What man of you hauing an hundreth sheepe, if hee lose one of them, doeth not leaue ninetie and nine in the wildernesse, and goe after that which is lost, vntill he finde it?

5. And when he hath found it, he laieth it on his shoulders with ioye.

6. And when he commeth home, he calleth together his friendes and neighbours, saying vnto them, Reioyce with mee: for I haue founde my sheepe which was lost.

7. I say vnto you, that likewise ioy shall be in heauen for one sinner that conuerteth, more then for ninetie and nine iust men, which neede none amendement of life.

8. Either what woma hauing ten groates, if she lose one groate, doth not light a candle, & sweepe the house, and seeke diligently till shee finde it?

9. And when shee hath found it, shee calleth her friendes, and neighbours, saying, Reioyce with me: for I haue found the groate which I had lost.

10. Likewise I say vnto you, there is ioy in the presence of the Angels of God, for one sinner that conuerteth.

11. 
          

12. And the yonger of them sayde to his father, Father, giue mee the portion of the goods that falleth to mee. So he deuided vnto them his substance.

13. So not many daies after, when the yonger sonne had gathered all together, hee tooke his iourney into a farre countrey, and there hee wasted his goods with riotous liuing.

14. Nowe when hee had spent all, there arose a great dearth throughout that land, and he began to be in necessitie.

15. Then hee went and claue to a citizen of that conntrey, and hee sent him to his farme, to feede swine.

16. And hee would faine haue filled his bellie with the huskes, that the swine ate: but no man gaue them him.

17. 
          

18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against 

19. And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired seruants.

20. So hee arose and came to his father, and when hee was yet a great way off, his father sawe him, and had compassion, and ranne and fell on his necke, and kissed him.

21. 
          

22. Then the father said to his seruaunts, Bring foorth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feete,

23. And bring the fat calfe, and kill him, & let vs eate, and be merie:

24. For this my sonne was dead, and is aliue againe: and he was lost, but he is found; they began to be merie.

25. 
          

26. And called one of his seruaunts, and asked what those things meant.

27. And hee sayde vnto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatte calfe, because he hath receiued him safe and sound.

28. Then he was angry, and would not goe in: therefore came his father out and entreated him.

29. But he answered & said to his father, Loe, these many yeeres haue I done thee seruice, neither brake I at any time thy commadement, and yet thou neuer gauest mee a kidde that I might make merie with my friends.

30. But when this thy sonne was come, which hath deuoured thy good with harlots, thou hast for his sake killed the fat calfe.

31. And he said vnto him, Sonne, thou art euer with me, and al that I haue, is thine.

32. It was meete that we shoulde make merie, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is aliue againe: and hee was lost, but he is found.

## Luke 16

1. And he said also unto his disciples, 

2. And hee called him, and saide vnto him, Howe is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an accounts of thy stewardship: for thou maiest be no longer steward.

3. Then the stewarde saide within himselfe, What shall I doe? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot digge, and to begge I am ashamed.

4. I knowe what I will doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue mee into their houses.

5. Then called he vnto him euery one of his masters detters, & said vnto the first, Howe much owest thou vnto my master?

6. And he said, An hudreth measures of oyle; he saide to him, Take thy writing, and sitte downe quickely, and write fiftie.

7. Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And hee sayde, An hundreth measures of wheate. Then he saide to him, Take thy writing, and write foure score.

8. And the lord commended 

9. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon 

10. 
          

11. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the 

12. And if ye have not been faithful in that which is 

13. 
          

14. All these thinges heard the Pharises also which were couetous, and they scoffed at him.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. Nowe it is more easie that heauen and earth shoulde passe away, then that one title of the Lawe should fall.

18. Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her 

19. 
          

20. Also there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was laide at his gate full of sores,

21. And desired to bee refreshed with the crommes that fell from the riche mans table: yea, and the dogges came and licked his sores.

22. And it was so that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome. The rich man also died, and was buried.

23. And in hell 

24. Then he cried, and saide, Father Abraham, haue mercie on mee, and sende Lazarus that hee may dippe the tip of his finger in water, & coole my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.

25. But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines: now therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented.

26. Besides all this, betweene you & vs there is a great gulfe set, so that they which would goe from hence to you, can not: neither ca they come from thence to vs.

27. 
          

28. (For I haue fiue brethren) that he may testifie vnto them, least they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham said vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets: let them heare them.

30. And he sayde, Nay, father Abraham: but if one came vnto them from the dead, they will amend their liues.

31. Then he saide vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead againe.

## Luke 17

1. Then said he unto the disciples, 

2. It is better for him that a great milstone were hanged about his necke, and that he were cast into ye sea, then that he should offende one of these litle ones.

3. 
          

4. And though he sinne against thee seuen times in a day, and seuen times in a day turne againe to thee, saying, It repenteth mee, thou shalt forgiue him.

5. 
          

6. And the Lord said, If ye had faith as 

7. 
          

8. And woulde not rather say to him, Dresse wherewith I may suppe, and girde thy selfe, and serue mee, till I haue eaten and drunken, and afterward eate thou, and drinke thou?

9. Doeth he thanke that seruant, because hee did that which was commaunded vnto him? I trowe not.

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. And as hee entred into a certaine towne, there met him tenne men that were lepers, which stoode a farre off.

13. And they lift vp their voyces and saide, Iesus, Master, haue mercie on vs.

14. And when he saw them, he said vnto them, Goe, shewe your selues vnto the Priestes; it came to passe, that as they went, they were clensed.

15. Then one of them, when hee sawe that hee, was healed, turned backe, and with a loude voyce praised God,

16. And fell downe on his face at his feete, and gaue him thankes: and he was a Samaritan.

17. And Iesus answered, and said, Are there not tenne clensed? but where are the nine?

18. There is none founde that returned to giue God praise, saue this stranger.

19. And he saide vnto him, Arise, goe thy way, thy faith hath saued thee.

20. 
          

21. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is 

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. For as the lightening that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen, shineth vnto the other part vnder heauen, so shall the Sonne of man be in his day.

25. But first must he suffer many things, and be reprooued of this generation.

26. 
          

27. They ate, they dranke, they married wiues, and gaue in marriage vnto the day that Noe went into the Arke: and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

28. Likewise also, as it was in the dayes of Lot: they ate, they dranke, they bought, they solde, they planted, they built.

29. But in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heauen, and destroyed them all.

30. After these ensamples shall it be in the day when the Sonne of man is reueiled.

31. 
          

32. Remember Lots wife.

33. Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall 

34. I tell you, in that night there shall be two in one bed: the one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe left.

35. Two women shalbe grinding together: the one shalbe taken, and the other shalbe left.

36. Two shalbe in the fielde: one shalbe receiued, and another shalbe left.

## Luke 18

1. And 

2. 
          

3. And there was a widowe in that citie, which came vnto him, saying, Doe mee iustice against mine aduersarie.

4. And hee would not of a long time: but afterward he said with himselfe, Though I feare not God, nor reuerence man,

5. Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she 

6. And the Lord said, Heare what the vnrighteous iudge saith.

7. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though

17. 
          

18. Then a certaine ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what ought I to doe, to inherite eternall life?

19. And Iesus said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, saue one, euen God.

20. Thou knowest the comandements, Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnes: Honour thy father and thy mother.

21. 
          

22. Nowe when Iesus heard that, he saide vnto him, Yet lackest thou one thing. Sell all that euer thou hast, and distribute vnto the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come followe mee.

23. But when he heard those things, he was very heauie: for he was marueilous riche.

24. 
          

25. Surely it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, then for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of God.

26. Then said they that heard it, And who then can be saued?

27. And he said, The things which are vnpossible with men, are possible with God.

28. Then Peter said, Loe, we haue left all, and haue followed thee.

29. 
          

30. Which shall not receiue much more in this world, and in the world to come life euerlasting.

31. 
          

32. For he shal be deliuered vnto the Gentiles, and shalbe mocked, and shalbe spitefully entreated, and shalbe spitted on.

33. And when they haue scourged him, they will put him to death: but the thirde day hee shall rise againe.

34. And they understood 

35. 
          

36. And when he heard the people passe by, he asked what it meant.

37. And they saide vnto him, that Iesus of Nazareth passed by.

38. Then hee cried, saying, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on me.

39. 
          

40. And Iesus stoode stil, and commanded him to be brought vnto him; when he was come neere, he asked him,

41. Saying, What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receiue my sight.

42. And Iesus said vnto him, Receiue thy sight: thy faith hath saued thee.

43. Then immediatly he receiued his sight, and followed him, praysing God: and all the people, when they sawe this, gaue praise to God.

## Luke 19

1. And 

2. And, behold, [there was] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the 

3. And he sought to see Iesus, who hee should be, and coulde not for the preasse, because he was of a lowe stature.

4. Wherefore he ranne before, and climed vp into a wilde figge tree, that he might see him: for he should come that way.

5. And when Iesus came to the place, he looked vp, and saw him, and said vnto him, Zaccheus, come downe at once: for to day I must abide at thine house.

6. Then he came downe hastily, and receiued him ioyfully.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a 

10. For the Sonne of man is come to seeke, and to saue that which was lost.

11. 
          

12. He saide therefore, A certaine noble man went into a farre countrey, to receiue for himselfe a kingdome, and so to come againe.

13. 
          

14. Nowe his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs.

15. And it came to passe, when hee was come againe, and had receiued his kingdome, that he commanded the seruants to be called to him, to whome he gaue his money, that he might knowe what euery man had gained.

16. Then came the first, saying, Lord, 

17. And he sayd vnto him, Well, good seruant: because thou hast bene faithfull in a very litle thing, take thou authoritie ouer ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy piece hath encreased fiue pieces.

19. And to the same he sayd, Be thou also ruler ouer fiue cities.

20. 
          

21. For I feared thee, because thou art a straight man: thou takest vp, that thou layedst not downe, and reapest that thou diddest not sowe.

22. Then he sayde vnto him, Of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, O euill seruant. Thou knewest that I am a straight man, taking vp that I layd not downe, & reaping that I did not sowe.

23. Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the 

24. And he sayd to them that stoode by, Take from him that piece, and giue it him that hath ten pieces.

25. (And they sayd vnto him, Lord, hee hath ten pieces.)

26. For I say vnto you, that vnto all them that haue, it shalbe giuen: and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken from him.

27. Moreouer, those mine enemies, which would not that I should reigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

28. And when he had thus spoken, 

29. 
          

30. Saying, Goe ye to the towne which is before you, wherein, assoone as ye are come, ye shall finde a colte tied, whereon neuer man sate: loose him, and bring him hither.

31. And if any man aske you, why ye loose him, thus shall ye say vnto him, Because the Lord hath neede of him.

32. So they that were sent, went their way, and found it as he had sayd vnto them.

33. And as they were loosing the colte, the owners thereof sayd vnto them, Why loose ye the colte?

34. And they sayd, The Lorde hath neede of him.

35. So they brought him to Iesus, and they cast their garments on the colte, and set Iesus thereon.

36. And as he went, they spred their clothes in the way.

37. And when he was nowe come neere to the going downe of the mount of Oliues, the whole multitude of the disciples began to reioyce, and to prayse God with a loude voyce, for all the great workes that they had seene,

38. Saying, Blessed be the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord: peace in heauen, and glory in the highest places.

39. 
          

40. But he answered, and sayd vnto them, I tell you, that if these should holde their peace, the stones would crie.

41. 
          

42. 
          

43. For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compasse thee round, and keepe thee in on euery side,

44. And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not 

45. 
          

46. Saying vnto them, It is written, Mine house is the house of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of theeues.

47. And he taught dayly in the Temple; the hie Priests and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people sought to destroy him.

48. But they could not finde what they might doe to him: for all the people hanged vpon him when they heard him.

## Luke 20

1. And 

2. And spake vnto him, saying, Tell vs by what authoritie thou doest these things, or who is hee that hath giuen thee this authoritie?

3. And he answered, and sayde vnto them, I also will aske you one thing: tell me therefore:

4. The baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men?

5. And they reasoned within themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he will say, Why then beleeued ye him not?

6. But if we shall say, Of men, all the people will stone vs: for they be perswaded that Iohn was a Prophet.

7. Therefore they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

8. Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Neither tell I you, by what authoritie I doe these things.

9. 
          

10. And at the time conuenient he sent a seruant to the husbandmen, that they should giue him of the fruite of the vineyard: but the husbandmen did beate him, & sent him away emptie.

11. Againe he sent yet another seruant: and they did beate him, and foule entreated him, and sent him away emptie.

12. Moreouer he sent the third, and him they wounded, and cast out.

13. Then sayd the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send my beloued sonne: it may be that they will doe reuerence, when they see him.

14. But when the husbandmen sawe him, they reasoned with themselues, saying, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. So they cast him out of the vineyarde, and killed him. What shall the Lord of the vineyarde therefore doe vnto them?

16. He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and wil giue out his vineyard to others. But when they heard it, they sayd, God forbid.

17. And he beheld them, & said, What meaneth this then that is written, The stone that the builders refused, that is made the head of the corner?

18. Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone, shall be broken: and on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to pouder.

19. Then the hie Priests, and the Scribes the same houre went about to lay hands on him: (but they feared the people) for they perceiued that he had spoken this parable against them.

20. 
          

21. And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the 

22. Is it lawfull for vs to giue Cesar tribute or no?

23. But he perceived their 

24. Shew me a penie. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and sayd, Cesars.

25. Then he sayd vnto them, Giue then vnto Cesar the things which are Cesars, and to God those which are Gods.

26. And they could not reproue his saying before the people: but they marueiled at his answere, and helde their peace.

27. 
          

28. Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die hauing a wife, and hee die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise vp seede vnto his brother.

29. Now there were seuen brethren, & the first tooke a wife, and he dyed without children.

30. And the second tooke the wife, and he dyed childelesse.

31. Then the third tooke her: and so likewise the seuen dyed, and left no children.

32. And last of all the woman dyed also.

33. Therefore at the resurrection, whose wife of them shall she be? For seuen had her to wife.

34. And Jesus answering said unto them, The 

35. But they which shalbe counted worthy to enioy that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry wiues, neither are married.

36. Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the 

37. And that the dead shall rise againe, euen Moses shewed it besides the bush, when he said, The Lord is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob.

38. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all 

39. Then certaine of the Scribes answered, and sayd, Master, thou hast well sayd.

40. And after that, durst they not aske him any thing at all.

41. 
          

42. And Dauid himselfe sayth in the booke of the Psalmes, The Lord sayd vnto my Lorde, Sit at my right hand,

43. Till I shall make thine enemies thy footestoole.

44. Seeing Dauid called him Lord, howe is he then his sonne?

45. Then in the audience of all the people he sayd vnto his disciples,

46. 
          

47. Which devour widows' 

## Luke 21

1. And 

2. And he sawe also a certaine poore widowe which cast in thither two mites:

3. And he sayd, Of a trueth I say vnto you, that this poore widowe hath cast in more then they all.

4. For they all haue of their superfluitie cast into the offerings of God: but she of her penurie hath cast in all the liuing that she had.

5. 
          

6. Are these ye things that ye looke vpon? the dayes will come wherein a stone shall not be left vpon a stone, that shall not be throwen downe.

7. Then they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what signe shall there be when these things shall come to passe?

8. And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come 

9. 
          

10. Then said hee vnto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome,

11. And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places, and hunger, and pestilence, and fearefull things, & great signes shall there be from heauen.

12. But before all these, they shal lay their hands on you, and persecute you, deliuering you vp to the assemblies, and into prisons, and bring you before Kings and rulers for my Names sake.

13. And it shall turn to you for 

14. Lay it vp therefore in your heartes, that ye cast not before hand, what ye shall answere.

15. For I will giue you a mouth and wisdome, where against all your aduersaries shall not be able to speake, nor resist.

16. Yea, ye shalbe betrayed also of your parents, and of your brethren, and kinsmen, and friendes, and some of you shall they put to death.

17. And ye shall bee hated of all men for my Names sake.

18. Yet there shall not one heare of your heads perish.

19. In your patience 

20. 
          

21. Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines: and let them which are in the middes thereof, depart out: and let not them that are in the countrey, enter therein.

22. For these be the dayes of vengeance, to fulfill all things that are written.

23. But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and 

24. And they shall fall by the 

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. And then shall they see the Sonne of man come in a cloude, with power and great glory.

28. And when these things beginne to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your heades: for your redemption draweth neere.

29. 
          

30. When they nowe shoote foorth, ye seeing them, knowe of your owne selues, that sommer is then neere.

31. So likewise yee, when yee see these thinges come to passe, knowe ye that the kingdome of God is neere.

32. Verely I say vnto you, This age shall not passe, till all these things be done:

33. Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my wordes shall not passe away.

34. Take heede to your selues, lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfeting and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and least that day come on you at vnwares.

35. For as a snare shall it come 

36. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to

38. And all the people came in the morning to him, to heare him in the Temple.

## Luke 22

1. Now the 

2. And the hie Priests and Scribes sought how they might kill him: for they feared the people.

3. 
          

4. And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and 

5. So they were glad, and agreed to giue him money.

6. And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the 

7. 
          

8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the 

9. And they saide to him, Where wilt thou, that we prepare it?

10. Then he said vnto them, Beholde, when ye be entred into the citie, there shall a man meete you, bearing a pitcher of water: folowe him into the house that he entreth in,

11. And say vnto the good man of the house, The Master saith vnto thee, Where is the lodging where I shall eate my Passeouer with my disciples?

12. Then he shall shewe you a great hie chamber trimmed: there make it ready.

13. So they went, and found as he had said vnto them, and made readie the Passeouer.

14. 
          

15. And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I 

16. For I say vnto you, Hencefoorth I will not eate of it any more, vntill it bee fulfilled in the kingdome of God.

17. And hee tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and said, Take this, and deuide it among you,

18. For I say vnto you, I will not drinke of the fruite of the vine, vntill the kingdome of God be come.

19. 
          

20. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This

23. Then they began to enquire among themselues which of them it should be, that should do that.

24. 
          

25. And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called 

26. But yee shall not be so: but let the greatest among you be as the least: and the chiefest as he that serueth.

27. For who is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serueth? Is not he that sitteth at table? And I am among you as he that serueth.

28. 
          

29. Therefore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto me,

30. That ye may eate, and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and sit on seates, and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel.

31. 
          

32.

34. But he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cocke shall not crowe this day, before thou hast thrise denied that thou knewest me.

35. And he saide vnto them, When I sent you without bagge, and scrip, and shooes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

36. 
          

37. For I say vnto you, That yet the same which is written, must be perfourmed in me, Euen with the wicked was he nombred: for doubtlesse those things which are written of me, haue an ende.

38. And they said, Lord, beholde, here are two swordes; he said vnto them, It is ynough.

39. And he came out, and went (as he was wont) to the mount of Oliues: and his disciples also followed him.

40. 
          

41. 
          

42. Saying, Father, if thou wilt, take away this cuppe from mee: neuerthelesse, not my will, but thine be done.

43. And there appeared an Angell vnto him from heauen, comforting him.

44. And being in an

48. And Iesus saide vnto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the Sonne of man with a kisse?

49. 
          

50. And one of them smote a seruant of the hie Priest, and strooke off his right eare.

51. Then Iesus answered, and said, Suffer them thus farre: and he touched his eare, & healed him.

53. When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the 

54. Then took they him, and led [him], and brought him into the high priest's house. 

55. And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall, and were set downe together, Peter also sate downe among them.

56. And a certaine mayde behelde him as hee sate by the fire, and hauing well looked on him, said, This man was also with him.

57. But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

58. And after a little while, another man sawe him, and saide, Thou art also of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And about the space of an houre after, a certaine other affirmed, saying. Verely euen this man was with him: for he is also a Galilean.

60. And Peter saide, Man, I knowe not what thou sayest; immediatly while hee yet spake, the cocke crewe.

61. Then the Lorde turned backe, and looked vpon Peter: and Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, how he had said vnto him, Before the cocke crowe, thou shalt denie me thrise.

62. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

63. 
          

64. And when they had blindfolded him, they smote him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophecie who it is that smote thee.

65. And many other thinges blasphemously spake they against him.

66. 
          

67. Saying, Art thou that Christ? tell vs; he said vnto them, If I tell you, ye wil not beleeue it.

68. And if also I aske you, you will not answere me, nor let me goe.

69. Hereafter shall the Sonne of man sit at the right hand of the power of God.

70. Then sayd they all, Art thou then ye Sonne of God? And he sayd to them, Ye say, that I am.

71. Then sayd they, What neede we any further witnes? for we our selues haue heard it of his owne mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And 

2. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] 

3. And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Iewes? And hee answered him, and sayd, Thou sayest it.

4. Then sayd Pilate to the hie Priests, and to the people, I finde no fault in this man.

5. But they were the more fierce, saying, He moueth the people, teaching throughout all Iudea, beginning at Galile, euen to this place.

6. 
          

7. And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto 

8. And when Herod sawe Iesus, hee was exceedingly glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him, and trusted to haue seene some signe done by him.

9. Then questioned hee with him of many things: but he answered him nothing.

10. The hie Priests also & Scribes stood forth, and accused him vehemently.

11. And Herod with his 

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. And sayd vnto them, Ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerted the people: and beholde, I haue examined him before you, and haue found no fault in this man, of those things whereof ye accuse him:

15. No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him: and loe, nothing worthy of death is done of him.

16. 
          

17. (For of necessitie hee must haue let one loose vnto them at the feast.)

18. Then all ye multitude cried at once, saying, Away with him, and deliuer vnto vs Barabbas:

19. Which for a certaine insurrection made in the citie, and murther, was cast in prison.

20. Then Pilate spake againe to them, willing to let Iesus loose.

21. But they cried, saying, Crucifie, crucifie him.

22. 
          

23. But they were instant with loude voyces, and required that he might be crucified: and the voyces of them and of the hie Priests preuailed.

24. So Pilate gaue sentence, that it should be as they required.

25. And he let loose vnto them him that for insurrection and murther was cast into prison, whome they desired, and deliuered Iesus to doe with him what they would.

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. But Iesus turned backe vnto them, & said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe not for me, but weepe for your selues, and for your children.

29. For behold, the dayes wil come, when men shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombes that neuer bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue sucke.

30. Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, Fall on vs: and to the hilles, Couer vs.

35. And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the 

36. The souldiers also mocked him, and came and offered him vineger,

37. And said, If thou be the King of the Iewes, saue thy selfe.

38. 
          

39. 
          

40. But the other answered, and rebuked him, saying, Fearest thou not God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing 

42. And he sayd vnto Iesus, Lorde, remember me, when thou commest into thy kingdome.

43. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in

45. 
          

46. And Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and sayd, Father, into thine hands I commend my spirit; when hee thus had sayd, hee gaue vp the ghost.

47. 
          

48. And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things, which were done, smote their brestes, and returned.

49. 
          

50. 
          

51. Hee did not consent to the counsell and deede of them, which was of Arimathea, a citie of the Iewes: who also himselfe waited for the kingdome of God.

52. He went vnto Pilate, and asked the body of Iesus,

53. And tooke it downe, & wrapped it in a linnen cloth, and laide it in a tombe hewen out of a rocke, wherein was neuer man yet laide.

54. And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath

4. And it came to passe, that as they were amased thereat, beholde, two men suddenly stood by them in shining vestures.

5. And as they were afraide, & bowed downe their faces to the earth, they sayd to them, Why seeke ye him that liueth, among the dead?

6. He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake vnto you, when he was yet in Galile,

9. 
          

10. Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Ioanna, and Mary the mother of Iames, and other women with them, which tolde these things vnto the Apostles.

11. But their wordes seemed vnto them, as a fained thing, neither beleeued they them.

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. And they talked together of al these things that were done.

18. And 

19. And he said vnto them, What things? And they sayd vnto him, Of Iesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mightie in deede and in word before God, and all people,

20.

22. Yea, & certaine women among vs made vs astonied, which came early vnto the sepulchre.

23. And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seene a vision of Angels, which sayd, that he was aliue.

24. Therefore certaine of them which were with vs, went to the sepulchre, and found it euen so as the women had sayd, but him they saw not.

25. Then he sayd vnto them, O fooles and slowe of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue spoken!

26. Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

27. And he began at Moses, & at all the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them in all the Scriptures the things which were written of him.

28. And they drew neere vnto ye towne, which they went to, but he made as though hee would haue gone further.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he 

32. And they saide betweene themselues, Did not our heartes burne within vs, while he talked with vs by the way, and when he opened to vs the Scriptures?

33. And they rose vp the same houre, and returned to Hierusalem, and found the Eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them,

34. Which said, The Lord is risen in deede, and hath appeared to Simon.

35. And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in 

36. 
          

37. But they were abashed and afraide, supposing that they had seene a spirit.

38. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do 

39. Beholde mine handes and my feete: for it is I my selfe: handle me, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me haue.

40. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and feete.

41. And while they yet beleeued not for ioy, and wondred, he saide vnto them, Haue ye here any meate?

42. And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an honie combe,

43. And hee tooke it, and did eate before them.

44. 
          

45. Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures,

46. And said vnto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoued Christ to suffer, and to rise againe from the dead the third day,

47. And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, 

48. Nowe ye are witnesses of these things.

50.

53. And were continually in the Temple, praysing, and lauding God, Amen.
