## Acts 1

1. The 

2. Vntill the day that hee was taken vp, after that hee through the holy Ghost, had giuen commaundements vnto the Apostles, whome hee had chosen:

3. 
          

4. And, being 

5. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized 

6. 
          

7. And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the 

8. But yee shall receiue power of the holy Ghost, when he shall come on you: and ye shalbe witnesses vnto me both in Hierusalem and in all Iudea, and in Samaria, and vnto the vttermost part of the earth.

9. 
          

10. And while they looked stedfastly towarde heauen, as hee went, beholde, two men stoode by them in white apparell,

11. Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up 

12. Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath 

13. 
          

14. These all 

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. For hee was nombred with vs, and had obteined felowship in this ministration.

18. Now this man 

19. And it is knowen vnto all the inhabitants of Hierusalem, in so much, that that field is called in their owne language, Aceldama, That is, the field of blood.

20. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his 

21. 
          

22. Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up 

23. 
          

24. And they praied, saying, Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shewe whether of these two thou hast chosen,

25. That he may take 

26. Then they gaue foorth their lottes: and the lotte fell on Matthias, and hee was by a common consent counted with the eleuen Apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And 

2. And suddenly there came a sounde from heauen, as of a russhing and mightie winde, and it filled all the house where they sate.

3. And there appeared vnto them clouen tongues, like fire, and it sate vpon eche of them.

4. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with 

5. And there were dwelling at Hierusalem Iewes, men that feared God, of euery nation vnder heauen.

6. Nowe when this was noised, the multitude came together and were astonied, because that euery man heard them speake his owne language.

7. And they wondered al, and marueiled, saying among themselues, Beholde, are not all these which speake, of Galile?

8. 
          

9. Parthians, and Medes, & Elamites, and the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and of Iudea, and of Cappadocia, of Pontus, and Asia,

10. Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, 

11. Creetes, and Arabians: wee hearde them speake in our owne tongues the wonderful works of God.

12. 
          

13. Others 

14. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, 

15. For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is [but] the 

16. But this is that which was spoken by the 

17. 
          

18. And on my seruauntes, and on mine handmaides I will powre out of my Spirite in those daies, and they shall prophecie.

19. And I wil shew wonders in heauen aboue, and tokens in the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and the vapour of smoke.

20. The Sunne shalbe turned into darkenesse, and the moone into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and 

24. 
          

25. For Dauid sayeth concerning him, I beheld the Lorde alwaies before me: for hee is at my right hand, that l should not be shaken.

26. Therefore did mine heart reioyce, and my tongue was glad, and moreouer also my flesh shall rest in hope,

27. Because thou wilt not 

28. Thou hast 

29. Men and brethren, I may boldly speake vnto you of the Patriarke Dauid, that hee is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre remaineth with vs vnto this day.

30. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had 

31. Hee knowing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule shoulde not bee left in graue, neither his flesh shoulde see corruption.

32. 
          

33. Therefore being by the 

34. For Dauid is not ascended into heauen, but he sayth, The Lord sayd to my Lorde, Sit at my right hande,

35. Vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole.

36. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath 

37. Now when they heard it, they were pricked in their heartes, and said vnto Peter and the other Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we doe?

38. 
          

39. For the 

40. 
          

41. 
          

42. 
          

43. 
          

44. 
          

45. And they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all me, as euery one had need.

46. 
          

47. Praysing God, and had fauour with all the people: and the Lorde added to the Church from day to day, such as should be saued.

## Acts 3

1. Now 

2. And a certaine ma which was a creeple fro his mothers wombe, was caried, whom they layde dayly at the gate of the Temple called Beautifull, to aske almes of them that entred into ye Temple.

3. Who seeing Peter & Iohn, that they would enter into the Temple, desired to receiue an almes.

4. And Peter earnestly beholding him with Iohn, said, Looke on vs.

5. And he 

6. Then said Peter, Siluer & gold haue I none, but such as I haue, that giue I thee: In the Name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth, rise vp and walke.

7. And hee tooke him by the right hand, and lift him vp, and immediately his feete and ankle bones receiued strength.

8. And he leaped vp, stoode, and walked, and entred with them into the Temple, walking and leaping, and praysing God.

9. And all the people sawe him walke, and praysing God.

10. And they knewe him, that it was he which sate for the almes at the Beautifull gate of the Temple: and they were amased, and sore astonied at that, which was come vnto him.

11. And as the lame man which was healed 

12. 
          

13. The God of Abraham, & Isaac, and Iacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his Sonne Iesus, whom ye betrayed, & denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had iudged him to be deliuered.

14. But ye denied the Holy one and the Iust, and desired a murtherer to be giuen you,

15. And killed the Prince 

16. And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: 

17. 
          

18. But those things, which God before had shewed 

19. Amend your liues therefore, and turne, that your sinnes may be put away, whe the time of refreshing shal come from the presence of the Lord.

20. And he shall sende Iesus Christ, which before was preached vnto you,

21. 
          

22. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, 

23. For it shalbe that euery person which shall not heare that Prophet, shall be destroyed out of the people.

24. Yea, and all the prophets 

25. 
          

26. Unto you first God, having 

## Acts 4

1. And 

2. Taking it grieuously that they taught the people, and preached in Iesus Name the resurrection from the dead.

3. And they layde handes on them, and put them in holde, vntill the next day: for it was now euentide.

4. Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the 

5. And it came to pass on the morrow, that their 

6. And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the 

7. 
          

8. Then Peter ful of the holy Ghost, said vnto them, Ye rulers of the people, and Elders of Israel,

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. This is the stone cast aside of you builders which is become the head of the corner.

12. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other 

13. 
          

14. And beholding also the man which was healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

15. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they 

16. 
          

17. But that it be noysed no farther among the people, let vs threaten and charge them, that they speake hencefoorth to no man in this Name.

18. So they called them, and commaunded them, that in no wise they should speake or teach in the Name of Iesus.

19. 
          

20. For we cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard.

21. 
          

22. For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde, on whome this miracle of healing was shewed.

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. Which by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people imagine vaine things?

26. The Kings of the earth assembled, and the rulers came together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

27. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the 

28. For to 

29. And nowe, O Lorde, beholde their threatnings, and graunt vnto thy seruants with all boldnesse to speake thy word,

30. So that thou stretch forth thine hand, that healing, and signes, and wonders may be done by the Name of thine holy Sonne Iesus.

31. 
          

32. 
          

33. And with great power gaue the Apostles witnes of the resurrection of the Lord Iesus: and great grace was vpon them all.

34. 
          

35. And layde it downe at the Apostles feete, and it was distributed vnto euery man, according as he had neede.

36. Also Ioses which was called of the Apostles, Barnabas (that is by interpretation the sonne of consolation) being a Leuite, and of the countrey of Cyprus,

37. Where as he had land, solde it, and brought the money, & laid it downe at the Apostles feete.

## Acts 5

1. But 

2. And 

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan 

4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou 

5. Now when Ananias heard these wordes, he fell downe, and gaue vp the ghost. Then great feare came on all them that heard these things.

6. And the yong men rose vp, and tooke him vp, and caried him out, and buried him.

7. And it came to passe about the space of three houres after, that his wife came in, ignorant of that which was done.

8. And Peter sayd vnto her, Tell me, solde ye the land for so much? And she sayd, Yea, for so much.

9. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to 

10. Then she fell downe straightway at his feete, and yeelded vp the ghost: and the yong men came in, and found her dead, and caried her out, and buried her by her husband.

11. 
          

12. Thus by the hands of the Apostles were many signes and wonders shewed among the people (and they were all with one accorde in Solomons porche.

13. And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people 

14. Also the number of them that beleeued in the Lord, both of men and women, grewe more and more)

15. In so much that they brought the sicke into the streetes, and layd them on beds and couches, that at the least way the shadowe of Peter, when he came by, might shadow some of them.

16. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem, bringing sicke folkes, & them which were vexed with vncleane spirits, who were all healed.

17. 
          

18. And laide hands on the Apostles, and put them in the common prison.

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. 
          

22. But when the officers came, & found them not in the prison, they returned and tolde it,

23. Saying, Certainely we founde the prison shut as sure as was possible, and the keepers standing without, before the doores: but when we had opened, we found no man within.

24. Then when the chiefe Priest, and the captaine of the Temple, and the hie Priestes heard these things, they doubted of them, whereunto this would growe.

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. And when they had brought them, they set them before the Councill, & the chiefe Priest asked them,

28. 
          

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. Him hath God lift vp with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sauiour, to giue repentance to Israel, and forgiuenes of sinnes.

32. 
          

33. When they heard [that], they 

34. 
          

35. And sayd vnto them, Men of Israel, take heede to your selues, what ye intende to doe touching these men.

36. 
          

37. After this man, arose vp Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the tribute, and drewe away much people after him: hee also perished, and all that obeyed him, were scattered abroad.

38. And now I say unto you, 

39. But if it be of God, ye can not destroy it, lest ye be found euen fighters against God.

40. And to him they agreed, and called the Apostles: and when they had beaten them, they commaunded that they should not speake in the Name of Iesus, and let them goe.

41. 
          

42. And daily in the 

## Acts 6

1. And 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. And we will giue our selues continually to prayer, and to the ministration of the worde.

5. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Steuen a man full of fayth and of the holy Ghost, and Philippe, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a Proselyte of Antiochia,

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Then they suborned men, which saide, We haue heard him speake blasphemous wordes against Moses, and God.

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. For we haue heard him say, that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the ordinances, which Moses gaue vs.

15. And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, 

## Acts 7

1. Then 

2. 
          

3. And said vnto him, Come out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and come into the land, which I shall shewe thee.

4. Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran; after that his father was dead, God brought him from thence into this land, wherein ye now dwell,

5. And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not [so much as] to 

6. And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat [them] evil 

7. But the nation to whome they shall be in bondage, will I iudge, sayth God: and after that, they shall come forth and serue me in this place.

8. Hee gaue him also the couenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begate Isaac, and circumcised him the eight day: and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob the twelue Patriarkes.

9. 
          

10. And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him 

11. Then came there a famine ouer all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction, that our fathers found no sustenance.

12. But when Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt, he sent our fathers first:

13. And at the second time, Ioseph was knowen of his brethren, and Iosephs kindred was made knowen vnto Pharao.

14. Then sent Ioseph and caused his father to be brought, and all his kindred, euen threescore and fifteene soules.

15. So Iacob went downe into Egypt, and he dyed, and our fathers,

16. And were 

17. But when the time of the promes drewe neere, which God had sworne to Abraham, the people grewe and multiplied in Egypt,

18. Till another King arose, which knewe not Ioseph.

19. The same 

20. In which time Moses was born, and was 

21. And when he was cast out, Pharaos daughter tooke him vp, and nourished him for her owne sonne.

22. And Moses was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, and was mightie in wordes and in deedes.

23. Nowe when he was full fourtie yeere olde, it came into his heart to visite his brethren, the children of Israel.

24. And whe he saw one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, & auenged his quarell that had the harme done to him, and smote the Egyptian.

25. For hee supposed his brethren would haue vnderstand, that God by his hande should giue them deliuerance: but they vnderstoode it not.

26. And the next day, he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue, and woulde haue set them at one againe, saying, Syrs, ye are brethren: why doe ye wrong one to another?

27. But he that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince, and a iudge ouer vs?

28. Wilt thou kill mee, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

29. Then fled Moses at that saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begate two sonnes.

30. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an 

31. And when Moses sawe it, hee wondred at the sight: and as he drew neere to consider it, the voyce of the Lord came vnto him, saying,

32. I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Then Moses trembled, & durst not behold it.

33. Then the Lord said to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feete: for the place where thou standest, is holy ground.

34. I haue seene, I haue seene the affliction of my people, which is in Egypt, & I haue heard their groning, and am come downe to deliuer them: and nowe come, and I will sende thee into Egypt.

35. This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send [to be] a ruler and a deliverer by the 

36. Hee brought them out, doing wonders, and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wildernes fourtie yeeres.

37. 
          

38. This is he that was in the Congregation, in the wildernes with the Angell, which spake to him in mount Sina, and with our fathers, who receiued the liuely oracles to giue vnto vs.

39. To whom our fathers would not obey, but refused, and in their hearts turned backe againe into Egypt:

40. Saying vnto Aaron, Make vs gods that may goe before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.

41. And they made a 

42. Then God turned, and 

43. Yea, ye 

44. 
          

45. Which also our fathers that came after 

46. Who found fauour before God, and desired that hee might finde a tabernacle for the God of Iacob.

47. 
          

48. Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with handes, as saith the Prophet,

49. Heauen is my throne, and earth is my footestoole: what house wil ye build for me, saith the Lord? or what place is it that I should rest in?

50. Hath not mine hand made all these things?

51. 
          

52. Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted? & they haue slaine them, which shewed before of the comming of that Iust, of whome ye are now the betrayers and murtherers,

53. Who have received the law by the 

54. 
          

55. 
          

56. And said, Beholde, I see the heauens open, and the Sonne of man standing at the right hand of God.

57. 
          

58. And cast [him] out of the city, and stoned [him]: and the 

59. And they stoned Steuen, who called on God, and said, Lord Iesus, receiue my spirit.

60. 
          

## Acts 8

1. And 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went to and fro preaching the worde.

5. 
          

6. And the people gaue heed vnto those things which Philippe spake, with one accorde, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

7. For vncleane spirits crying with a loud voyce, came out of many that were possessed of them: and many taken with palsies, & that halted, were healed.

8. And there was great ioy in that citie.

9. 
          

10. To whome they gaue heede from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God.

11. And they gaue heed vnto him, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.

12. But assoone as they beleeued Philip, which preached the thinges that concerned the kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women.

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the 

16. (For as yet, hee was fallen downe on none of them, but they were baptized onely in the Name of the Lord Iesus.)

17. Then layd they their handes on them, and they receiued the holy Ghost.

18. 
          

19. Saying, Giue mee also this power, that on whomsoeuer I lay the handes, he may receiue the holy Ghost.

20. 
          

21. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this 

22. 
          

23. For I perceive that thou art in the 

24. Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye haue spoken, come vpon me.

25. So they, when they had testified & preached the worde of the Lord, returned to Hierusalem, and preached the Gospel in many townes of the Samaritans.

26. 
          

27. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch 

28. And as he returned sitting in his charet, he read Esaias the Prophet.

29. Then the Spirit said vnto Philip, Goe neere and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet.

30. And Philip ranne thither, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, and said, But vnderstandest thou what thou readest?

31. And he said, How can I, except some man should 

32. 
          

33. In his 

34. Then the Eunuche answered Philippe, and saide, I pray thee of whome speaketh the Prophet this? of himselfe, or of some other man?

35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, & preached vnto him Iesus.

36. And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water, and the Eunuche said, See, here is water: what doeth let me to be baptized?

37. 
          

38. Then he commaunded the charet to stand stil: & they went downe both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuche, and he baptized him.

39. And assoone as they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lorde caught away Philip, that the Eunuche sawe him no more: so he went on his way reioycing.

40. But Philippe was found at Azotus, and he walked to and fro preaching in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.

## Acts 9

1. And 

2. And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this 

3. Now as he iourneyed, it came to passe that as he was come neere to Damascus, suddenly there shined rounde about him a light from heauen.

4. And hee fell to the earth, and heard a voyce, saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

5. And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: [it is] 

6. He then both trembling and astonied, sayd, Lord, what wilt thou that I doe? And the Lord sayd vnto him, Arise and goe into the citie, and it shall be tolde thee what thou shalt doe.

7. And the men which journeyed with him 

8. And Saul arose from the ground, and opened his eyes, but sawe no man. Then led they him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus,

9. Where he was three dayes without sight, and neither ate nor dranke.

10. And there was a certaine disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and to him sayd the Lord in a vision, Ananias; he sayd, Beholde, I am here Lord.

11. And the Lord [said] unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for [one] called Saul, of 

12. (And he sawe in a vision a man named Ananias comming in to him, and putting his hands on him, that he might receiue his sight.)

13. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I haue heard by many of this man, howe much euill hee hath done to thy saints at Hierusalem.

14. Moreouer here hee hath authoritie of the hie Priestes, to binde all that call on thy Name.

15. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a 

16. For I will 

17. And Ananias went his way, and entered into 

18. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had bene scales, & suddenly he receiued sight, and arose, and was baptized,

19. And receiued meate, & was strengthened. So was Saul certaine dayes with the disciples which were at Damascus.

20. 
          

21. So that all that heard him, were amased, and sayde, Is not this hee, that made hauocke of them which called on this Name in Hierusalem, and came hither for that intent, that hee should bring them bound vnto the hie Priests?

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. But their laying awayte was knowen of Saul: nowe they watched the gates day and night, that they might kill him.

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. But Barnabas tooke him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared to them, howe hee had seene the Lord in the way, and that hee had spoken vnto him, and how he had spoken boldly at Damascus in the Name of Iesus.

28. 
          

29. And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the 

30. 
          

31. 
          

32. 
          

33. And there he found a certaine man named Aeneas, which had kept his couch eight yeeres, and was sicke of the palsie.

34. Then said Peter vnto him, Aeneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise and trusse thy couch together; he arose immediately.

35. And all that dwelt at 

36. 
          

37. And it came to passe in those dayes, that she was sicke & dyed: and when they had washed her, they layd her in an vpper chamber.

38. Now forasmuch as Lydda was nere to Ioppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent vnto him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come vnto them.

39. Then Peter arose and came with them: and when hee was come, they brought him into the vpper chamber, where all the widowes stoode by him weeping, and shewing the coates and garments, which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

40. But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled downe, and prayed, and turned him to the body, and sayd, Tabitha, arise; she opened her eyes, and when she sawe Peter, sate vp.

41. Then he gaue her the hand and lift her vp, and called the Saints and widowes, and restored her aliue.

42. And it was knowen throughout all Ioppa, and many beleeued in the Lord.

43. And it came to passe that he taried many dayes in Ioppa with one Simon a Tanner.

## Acts 10

1. There 

2. [A] 

3. He sawe in a vision euidently (about the ninth houre of the day) an Angel of God coming in to him, and saying vnto him, Cornelius.

4. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, 

5. Nowe therefore send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter.

6. Hee lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe.

7. And when the Angel which spake vnto Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his seruants, and a souldier that feared God, one of them that waited on him,

8. And tolde them all things, and sent them to Ioppa.

9. On the morow as they went on their iourney, and drew neere vnto the citie, Peter went vp vpon the house to pray, about the sixt houre.

10. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a 

11. And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the 

12. Wherein were 

13. And there came a voyce to him, Arise, Peter: kill, and eate.

14. 
          

15. And the voice [spake] unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, [that] 

16. This was so done thrise: and the vessell was drawen vp againe into heauen.

17. Nowe while Peter douted in himselfe what this vision which he had seene, meant, beholde, the men which were sent from Cornelius, had inquired for Simons house, and stoode at the gate,

18. And called, and asked, whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.

19. And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit sayde vnto him, Beholde, three men seeke thee.

20. Arise therefore, and get thee downe, and goe with them, and doute nothing: For I haue sent them.

21. Then Peter went downe to the men, which were sent vnto him from Cornelius, and sayd, Beholde, I am he whome ye seeke: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?

22. And they sayd, Cornelius the captaine, a iust man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Iewes, was warned from heauen by an holy Angel, to send for thee into his house, and to heare thy wordes.

23. Then called he them in, and lodged them, and the next day, Peter went foorth with them, and certaine brethren from Ioppa accompanied him.

24. And the day after, they entred into Cesarea. Nowe Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsemen, and special friends.

25. 
          

26. But Peter tooke him vp, saying, Stand vp: for euen I my selfe am a man.

27. And as he talked with him, he came in, and found many that were come together.

28. And he sayd vnto them, Ye know that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is a Iewe, to company, or come vnto one of another nation: but God hath shewed me, that I should not call any man polluted, or vncleane.

29. Therefore came I vnto you without saying nay, when I was sent for. I aske therefore, for what intent haue ye sent for me?

30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until 

31. 
          

32. 
          

33. Then sent I for thee immediately, and thou hast well done to come. Nowe therefore are we all here present before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee of God.

34. 
          

35. But in every nation he that 

36. The 

37. 
          

38. How God 

39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Iewes, and in Hierusalem, whom they slewe, hanging him on a tree.

40. Him God raysed vp the third day, and caused that he was shewed openly:

41. Not to all the people, but unto witnesses 

42. And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie, that it is he that is ordained of God a iudge of quicke and dead.

43. To him also giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name all that beleeue in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes.

44. 
          

45. So they of the circumcision which beleeued, were astonied, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was powred out the gift of the holy Ghost.

46. For they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God. Then answered Peter,

47. 
          

48. So he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tary certaine dayes.

## Acts 11

1. And 

2. And when Peter was come vp to Hierusalem, they of the circumcision contended against him,

3. Saying, Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised, and hast eaten with them.

4. Then Peter beganne, and expounded the thing in order to them, saying,

5. I was in the citie of Ioppa, praying, and in a trance I sawe this vision, A certaine vessell comming downe as it had bene a great sheete, let downe from heauen by the foure corners, and it came to me.

6. Towarde the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and sawe foure footed beastes of the earth, and wilde beastes, and creeping things, and foules of the heauen.

7. Also I heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Arise, Peter: slay and eate.

8. And I said, God forbid, Lord: for nothing polluted or vncleane hath at any time entred into my mouth.

9. But the voyce answered me the seconde time from heauen, The things that God hath purified, pollute thou not.

10. And this was done three times, and all were taken vp againe into heauen.

11. Then behold, immediatly there were three men already come vnto the house where I was, sent from Cesarea vnto me.

12. And the Spirit saide vnto me, that I should go with them, without doubting: moreouer these sixe brethren came with me, and we entred into the mans house.

13. And he shewed vs, howe he had seene an Angel in his house, which stoode and said to him, Send men to Ioppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter.

14. He shall speake wordes vnto thee, whereby both thou and all thine house shalbe saued.

15. And as I began to speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, euen as vpon vs at the beginning.

16. Then I remembred the word of the Lord, howe he said, Iohn baptized with water, but ye shalbe baptized with the holy Ghost.

17. For as much then as God gaue them a like gift, as he did vnto vs, when we beleeued in the Lorde Iesus Christ, who was I, that I coulde let God?

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, so that a great number beleeued and turned vnto the Lord.

22. 
          

23. Who when he was come and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted all, that with purpose of heart they would continue in the Lord.

24. For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and faith, and much people ioyned them selues vnto the Lord.

25. 
          

26. And when he had founde him, he brought him vnto Antiochia: and it came to passe that a whole yere they were conuersant with ye Church, and taught much people, in so much that the disciples were first called Christians in Antiochia.

27. 
          

28. And there stoode vp one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which also came to passe vnder Claudius Cesar.

29. 
          

30. Which thing they also did, and sent it to the Elders, by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. Now 

2. And he 

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. And when Herod woulde haue brought him out vnto the people, the same night slept Peter betweene two souldiers, bound with two chaines, and the keepers before the doore, kept the prison.

7. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon [him], and a light shined in the 

8. And the Angel saide vnto him, Girde thy selfe, and binde on thy sandales; so he did. Then he said vnto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and followe me.

9. So Peter came out and followed him, and knewe not that it was true, which was done by the Angel, but thought he had seene a vision.

10. Nowe when they were past the first and the second watch, they came vnto the yron gate, that leadeth vnto the citie, which opened to them by it owne accord, and they went out, and passed through one streete, and by and by the Angel departed from him.

11. And when Peter was come to himselfe, he said, Nowe I know for a trueth, that the Lord hath sent his Angel, and hath deliuered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the wayting for of the people of the Iewes.

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. But when she knew Peters voyce, she opened not the entrie doore for gladnesse, but ranne in, and tolde howe Peter stood before the entrie.

15. But they said vnto her, Thou art mad. Yet she affirmed it constantly, that it was so. Then said they, It is his Angel.

16. But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened it, and sawe him, they were astonied.

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commaunded them to be led to be punished; he went downe from Iudea to Cesarea, and there abode.

20. 
          

21. And vpon a day appointed, Herod arayed himselfe in royall apparell, and sate on the iudgement seate, and made an oration vnto them.

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. So Barnabas and Saul returned from Hierusalem, when they had fulfilled their office, and tooke with them Iohn, whose surname was Marke.

## Acts 13

1. Now 

2. As they 

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. And when they were at Salamis, they preached the worde of God in the Synagogues of the Iewes: and they had also Iohn to their minister.

6. So when they had gone throughout the yle vnto Paphus, they found a certaine sorcerer, a false prophet, being a Iewe, named Bariesus,

7. Which was with the Deputie Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He called vnto him Barnabas and Saul, and desired to heare the woorde of God.

8. 
          

9. Then Saul (which also is called Paul) being full of the holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,

10. 
          

11. And now, behold, the 

12. Then the Deputie when he sawe what was done, beleeued, and was astonied at the doctrine of the Lord.

13. 
          

14. But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in 

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and 

18. And about the time of fourtie yeeres, suffered he their maners in the wildernesse.

19. And he destroied seuen nations in the land of Chanaan, & deuided their lad to them by lot.

20. And after that he gave [unto them] judges about the space of 

21. And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of 

22. And after he had taken him away, he raised vp Dauid to be their King, of whom he witnessed, saying, I haue found Dauid the sonne of Iesse, a man after mine owne heart, which will doe all things that I will.

23. 
          

24. When John had first preached 

25. And when Iohn had fulfilled his course, he saide, Whom ye thinke that I am, I am not he: but beholde, there commeth one after me, whose shooe of his feete I am not worthy to loose.

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate to kill him.

29. And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they tooke him downe from the tree, and put him in a sepulchre.

30. 
          

31. And hee was seene many dayes of them, which came vp with him from Galile to Hierusalem, which are his witnesses vnto the people.

32. And we declare vnto you, that touching the promise made vnto the fathers,

33. God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he 

34. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, [now] no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the 

35. 
          

36. Howbeit, Dauid after hee had serued his time by the counsell of God, hee slept, and was laid with his fathers, and sawe corruption.

37. But he whom God raised vp, sawe no corruption.

38. 
          

39. And by him all that believe are justified from 

40. 
          

41. Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish away: for I woorke a woorke in your daies, a woorke which yee shall not beleeue, if a man would declare it you.

42. 
          

43. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and 

44. And ye next Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together, to heare the worde of God.

45. 
          

46. 
          

47. For so hath the Lord commanded vs, saying, I haue made thee a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be the saluation vnto the end of the world.

48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were 

49. Thus the worde of the Lord was published throughout the whole countrey.

50. 
          

51. 
          

52. And the disciples were filled with ioy, and with the holy Ghost.

## Acts 14

1. And 

2. But the 

3. 
          

4. But the multitude of the city was deuided: and some were with the Iewes, and some with the Apostles.

5. And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and of the Iewes with their rulers, to doe them violence, and to stone them,

6. They were ware of [it], and 

7. And there preached the Gospel.

8. 
          

9. He heard Paul speake: who beholding him, and perceiuing that he had faith to be healed,

10. Said with a loude voyce, Stand vpright on thy feete; he leaped vp, and walked.

11. Then when the people sawe what Paul had done, they lift vp their voyces, saying in ye speach of Lycaonia, Gods are come downe to vs in the likenesse of men.

12. And they called Barnabas, Iupiter: and Paul, Mercurius, because hee was the chiefe speaker.

13. Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the 

14. But when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard it, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying,

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. Neuerthelesse, hee left not him selfe without witnes, in that hee did good and gaue vs raine from heauen, & fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with foode, and gladnesse.

18. And speaking these things, scarce appeased they the multitude, that they had not sacrificed vnto them.

19. 
          

20. Howbeit, as the disciples stoode rounde about him, hee arose vp, and came into the citie, and the next day hee departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into 

26. And thence sailed to 

27. And when they were come & had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all the things that God had done by them, and howe he had opened the doore of faith vnto the Gentiles.

28. So there they abode a long time with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. And 

2. 
          

3. And 

4. And when they were come to Hierusalem, they were receiued of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders, and they declared what things God had done by them.

5. But said they, certaine of the sect of the Pharises, which did beleeue, rose vp, saying, that it was needefull to circumcise them, and to commaunde them to keepe the lawe of Moses.

6. 
          

7. And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, 

8. And God which knoweth the heartes, bare them witnesse, in giuing vnto them ye holy Ghost euen as he did vnto vs.

9. And put no 

10. 
          

11. But we beleeue, through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ to be saued, euen as they doe.

12. 
          

13. And after they had held their peace, 

14. 
          

15. And to this agree the woordes of the Prophets, as it is written,

16. After this I will returne, and will builde againe the tabernacle of Dauid, which is fallen downe, and the ruines thereof will I build againe, and I will set it vp,

17. That the residue of men might seeke after the Lorde, and all the Gentiles vpon whom my Name is called, saith the Lorde which doeth all these things.

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. But that we write unto them, that they abstain from 

21. For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preache him, seeing he is read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day.

22. 
          

23. And wrote letters by them after this maner, The Apostles, and the Elders, and the brethren, vnto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antiochia, and in Syria, and in Cilicia, send greeting.

24. 
          

25. It seemed therefore good to vs, when we were come together with one accord, to send chosen men vnto you, with our beloued Barnabas and Paul,

26. Men that haue giuen vp their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.

27. We haue therefore sent Iudas and Silas, which shall also tell you ye same things by mouth.

28. 
          

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. And when they had read it, they reioyced for the consolation.

32. And Iudas and Silas being Prophets, exhorted the brethren with many wordes, & strengthened them.

33. And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in 

34. Notwithstanding Silas thought good to abide there still.

35. Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antiochia, teaching and preaching with many other, the worde of the Lord.

36. 
          

37. 
          

38. But Paul thought it not meete to take him vnto their companie, which departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the worke.

39. 
          

40. And Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended of the brethren vnto the grace of God.

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, stablishing the Churches.

## Acts 16

1. Then 

2. Which was 

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. And so were the Churches stablished in the faith, and encreased in number daily.

6. 
          

7. Then came they to Mysia, and sought to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

8. Therefore they passed through Mysia, and came downe to Troas,

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Then went we forth from Troas, and with a straight course came to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis,

12. And from thence to Philippi, which is the chiefe citie in ye partes of Macedonia, & whose inhabitants came from Rome to dwell there, and we were in that citie abiding certaine dayes.

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. She followed Paul and vs, and cryed, saying, These men are the seruants of the most high God, which shewe vnto you the way of saluation.

18. And this did she 

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. And when they had beaten them sore, they cast them into prison, commaunding the Iayler to keepe them surely.

24. Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet 

25. 
          

26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundation of the prison was shaken: and by and by all the doores opened, and euery mans bands were loosed.

27. 
          

28. 
          

29. Then he called for a light, and leaped in, and came trembling, and fell downe before Paul and Silas,

30. And brought them out, and said, Syrs, what must I doe to be saued?

31. And they saide, Beleeue in the Lorde Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saued, & thine houshold.

32. And they preached vnto him the worde of the Lord, and to all that were in the house.

33. 
          

34. And when he had brought them into his house, he set meate before them, and reioyced that he with all his houshold beleeued in God.

35. 
          

36. Then the keeper of the prison tolde these woordes vnto Paul, saying, The gouerness haue sent to loose you: nowe therefore get you hence, and goe in peace.

37. 
          

38. 
          

39. Then came they and praied them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the citie.

40. 
          

## Acts 17

1. Now 

2. And Paul, as his maner was, went in vnto them, and three Sabbath daies disputed with them by the Scriptures,

3. 
          

4. And some of them beleeued, and ioyned in companie with Paul and Silas: also of the Grecians that feared God a great multitude, and of the chiefe women not a fewe.

5. 
          

6. And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the 

7. Whom Iason hath receiued, and these all doe against the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another King, one Iesus.

8. Then they troubled the people, and the heads of the citie, when they heard these things.

9. And when they had taken 

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. Therefore many of them beleeued, and of honest women, which were Grecians, and men not a fewe.

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with 

18. 
          

19. And they took him, and brought him unto 

20. For thou bringest certaine strange thinges vnto our eares: we woulde knowe therefore, what these things meane.

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. For as I passed by, and beheld your 

24. 
          

25. Neither is worshipped with mens handes, as though he needed any thing, seeing hee giueth to all life and breath and all things,

26. 
          

27. That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might 

28. For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as also certaine of your owne Poets haue sayd, for we are also his generation.

29. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, 

30. 
          

31. Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he hath ordained; [whereof] he hath given 

32. 
          

33. And so Paul departed from among them.

34. Howbeit certaine men claue vnto Paul, and beleeued: among whome was also Denys Areopagita, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them.

## Acts 18

1. After 

2. And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that 

3. And because hee was of the same crafte, he abode with them and wrought (for their crafte was to make tentes.)

4. 
          

5. And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul 

6. 
          

7. So he departed thence, & entred into a certaine mans house, named Iustus, a worshipper of God, whose house ioyned hard to the Synagogue.

8. And Crispus the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, beleeued in the Lorde with all his housholde: and many of the Corinthians hearing it, beleeued and were baptized.

9. 
          

10. For I am with thee, and no man shall lay handes on thee to hurt thee: for I haue much people in this citie.

11. And he 

12. 
          

13. Saying, This fellow persuadeth me to worship God otherwise then the Lawe appointeth.

14. And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, 

15. But if it be a question of 

16. And hee draue them from the iudgement seate.

17. Then tooke al the Grecians Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, and beat him before the iudgement seat: but Gallio cared nothing for those things.

18. 
          

19. Then hee came to Ephesus, and left them there: but hee entred into the Synagogue and disputed with the Iewes.

20. 
          

21. But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, 

22. And when hee came downe to Cesarea, he went vp to Hierusalem: and when he had saluted the Church, he went downe vnto Antiochia.

23. Nowe when he had taried there a while, he departed, and went thorowe the countrey of Galatia and Phrygia by order, strengthening all the disciples.

24. 
          

25. The same was instructed in the way of the Lorde, and hee spake feruently in the Spirite, and taught diligently the things of the Lord, & knew but the baptisme of Iohn onely.

26. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto [them], and expounded unto him the 

27. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through 

28. For mightily hee confuted publikely the Iewes, with great vehemencie, shewing by the Scriptures, that Iesus was that Christ.

## Acts 19

1. And 

2. He said unto them, Have ye received the 

3. 
          

4. Then saide Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying vnto the people, that they shoulde beleeue in him, which should come after him, that is, in Christ Iesus.

5. And when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.

6. So Paul layde his handes vpon them, and the holy Ghost came on them, and they spake the tongues, and prophecied.

7. And all the men were about twelue.

8. Moreouer he went into the Synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three moneths, disputing and exhorting to the things that appertaine to the kingdome of God.

9. 
          

10. And this was done by the space of two yeeres, so that all they which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of ye Lord Iesus, both Iewes & Grecians.

11. And God wrought no small miracles by the handes of Paul,

12. So that from his body were brought vnto the sicke, kerchefs or handkerchefs, and the diseases departed from them, and the euill spirits went out of them.

13. 
          

14. (And there were certaine sonnes of Sceua a Iewe, the Priest, about seuen which did this)

15. And the euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know: but who are ye?

16. And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and 

17. And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Grecians also, which dwelt at Ephesus, and feare came on them all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was magnified,

18. 
          

19. Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all [men]: and they counted the price of them, and found [it] 

20. So the worde of God grewe mightily, and preuailed.

21. 
          

22. So sent hee into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and Erastus, but he remained in Asia for a season.

23. 
          

24. For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver 

25. Whom he called together, with the workemen of like things, and saide, Syrs, ye knowe that by this craft we haue our goods:

26. Moreouer ye see and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia this Paul hath perswaded, and turned away much people, saying, That they be not gods which are made with handes.

27. So that not only 

28. Now when they heard it, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

29. And the whole citie was full of confusion, and they rushed into the common place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, and Pauls companions of his iourney.

30. And when Paul would haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him not.

31. 
          

32. Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of order, and the more part knewe not wherefore they were come together.

33. And some of the company drew foorth Alexander, the Iewes thrusting him forwards. Alexander then beckened with the hande, and woulde haue excused the matter to the people.

34. 
          

35. 
          

36. Seeing then that no man can speake against these things, ye ought to be appeased, and to doe nothing rashly.

37. For yee haue brought hither these men, which haue neither committed sacrilege, neither doe blaspheme your goddesse.

38. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a 

39. But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a 

40. For we are euen in ieopardie to be accused of this dayes sedition, for as much as there is no cause, whereby we may giue a reason of this concourse of people.

41. And when he had thus spoken, hee let the assembly depart.

## Acts 20

1. And 

2. And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them 

3. 
          

4. And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of them of Thessalonica, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of them of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.

5. These went before, and taried vs at Troas.

6. And we sailed forth from Philippi, after the dayes of vnleauened bread, & came vnto them to Troas in fiue dayes, where we abode seuen dayes.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. And there sate in a windowe a certaine yong man, named Eutychus, fallen into a dead sleepe: and as Paul was long preaching, hee ouercome with sleepe, fell downe from the thirde loft, and was taken vp dead.

10. But Paul went downe, and layde himselfe vpon him, and embraced him, saying, Trouble not your selues: for his life is in him.

11. Then when Paul was come vp againe, and had broken bread, and eaten, hauing spoken a long while till the dawning of the day, hee so departed.

12. And they brought the boye aliue, and they were not a litle comforted.

13. Then we went before to shippe, and sailed vnto the citie Assos, that wee might receiue Paul there: for so had hee appointed, and would himselfe goe afoote.

14. Now when he was come vnto vs to Assos, and we had receiued him, we came to Mitylenes.

15. And wee sailed thence, and came the next day ouer against Chios, and the next day we arriued at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium: the next day we came to Miletum.

16. 
          

17. And from 

18. 
          

19. Seruing the Lorde with all modestie, and with many teares, and tentations, which came vnto me by the layings awaite of the Iewes,

20. [And] how I kept 

21. Witnessing both to the Iewes, and to the Grecians the repentance towarde God, and faith toward our Lord Iesus Christ.

22. 
          

23. Saue that ye holy Ghost witnesseth in euery citie, saying, that bondes and afflictions abide me.

24. But I passe not at all, neither is my life deare vnto my selfe, so that I may fulfill my course with ioye, and the ministration which I haue receiued of the Lorde Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God.

25. And now behold, I know that henceforth ye all, through whome I haue gone preaching the kingdome of God, shall see my face no more.

26. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] 

27. 
          

28. Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to 

29. 
          

30. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to 

31. Therefore watche, and remember, that by the space of three yeres I ceased not to warne euery one, both night and day with teares.

32. 
          

33. 
          

34. Yea, ye knowe, that these handes haue ministred vnto my necessities, and to them that were with me.

35. I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought 

36. And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled downe, and prayed with them all.

37. 
          

38. Being chiefly sorie for the words which he spake, That they should see his face no more; they accompanied him vnto the shippe.

## Acts 21

1. And 

2. And we found a ship that went ouer vnto Phenice, and went aboard, and set forth.

3. And whe we had discouered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, & sailed toward Syria, and arriued at Tyrus: for there the ship vnladed ye burden.

4. And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the 

5. But when the dayes were ended, we departed & went our way, & they all accompanied vs with their wiues & children, euen out of the citie: and we kneeling downe on the shore, prayed.

6. Then when we had embraced one another, we tooke ship, and they returned home.

7. And when we had ended the course from Tyrus, we arriued at Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.

8. And the next [day] we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was [one] of the 

9. And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did 

10. And as we taried there many dayes, there came a certaine Prophet from Iudea, named Agabus.

11. And when he was come vnto vs, he tooke Pauls girdle, and bound his owne hands & feete, and sayd, Thus sayth the holy Ghost, So shall the Iewes at Hierusalem binde the man that oweth this girdle, and shall deliuer him into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. And when we had heard these things, both we and other of the same place besought him that he would not go vp to Hierusalem.

13. Then Paul answered, and sayd, What doe ye weeping and breaking mine heart? For I am ready not to be bound onely, but also to die at Hierusalem for the Name of the Lord Iesus.

14. 
          

15. And after those dayes we trussed vp our fardels, and went vp to Hierusalem.

16. There went with vs also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an olde disciple, with whome we should lodge.

17. And when we were come to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs gladly.

18. And the next day Paul went in with vs vnto Iames: and all the Elders were there assembled.

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. Now they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes, which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, and sayest that they ought not to circumcise their sonnes, neither to liue after the customes.

22. What is then to be done? the multitude must needes come together: for they shall heare that thou art come.

23. Doe therefore this that we say to thee. We haue foure men, which haue made a vowe,

24. Them take, and 

25. For as touching ye Gentiles, which beleeue, we haue written, & determined that they obserue no such thing, but that they keepe themselues from things offred to idoles, and from blood, and from that that is strangled, and from fornication.

26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, 

27. 
          

28. Crying, Men of Israel, helpe: this is the man that teacheth all men euery where against the people, and the Lawe, and this place: moreouer, he hath brought Grecians into the Temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

29. For they had seene before Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the citie, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple.

30. Then all the citie was moued, and the people ran together: and they tooke Paul and drewe him out of the Temple, and forth with the doores were shut.

31. 
          

32. Who immediately tooke souldiers & Centurions, and ran downe vnto them: and when they sawe the chiefe Captaine and the souldiers, they left beating of Paul.

33. Then the chiefe Captaine came neere and tooke him, and commaunded him to be bound with two chaines, and demaunded who he was, and what he had done.

34. And one cryed this, another that, among the people. So when he could not know the certeintie for the tumult, he commaunded him to be led into the castell.

35. And when hee came vnto the grieces, it was so that he was borne of the souldiers, for the violence of the people.

36. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.

37. And as Paul should haue bene led into the castell, he sayd vnto the chiefe Captaine, May I speake vnto thee? Who sayd, Canst thou speake Greeke?

38. Art not thou that 

39. Then Paul sayde, Doubtlesse, I am a man which am a Iewe, and citizen of Tarsus, a famous citie of Cilicia, and I beseech thee, suffer mee to speake vnto the people.

40. And when he had giuen him licence, Paul stoode on the grieces, & beckened with the hand vnto the people: and when there was made great silence, hee spake vnto them in the Hebrewe tongue, saying,

## Acts 22

1. Ye men, brethren and Fathers, heare my defence nowe towards you.

2. (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrewe tongue to them, they kept the more silence, and he sayd)

3. 
          

4. And I persecuted this way vnto the death, binding and deliuering into prison both men and women.

5. As also ye chiefe Priest doeth beare me witnes, & al the company of the Elders: of whom also I receiued letters vnto the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring them which were there, bound vnto Hierusalem, that they might be punished.

6. And so it was, as I iourneyed and was come neere vnto Damascus about noone, that suddenly there shone from heauen a great light round about me.

7. So I fell vnto the earth, and heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mee?

8. Then I answered, Who art thou, Lorde? And he said to me, I am Iesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

9. Moreouer they that were with me, sawe in deede a light and were afraide: but they heard not the voyce of him that spake vnto me.

10. Then I sayd, What shall I doe, Lord? And the Lorde sayde vnto me, Arise, and goe into Damascus: and there it shall be tolde thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to doe.

11. So when I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand of them that were with me, and came into Damascus.

12. And one Ananias a godly man, as perteining to the Lawe, hauing good report of all the Iewes which dwelt there,

13. Came vnto me, and stoode, and sayd vnto me, Brother Saul, receiue thy sight: and that same houre I looked vpon him.

14. And he sayd, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee, that thou shouldest knowe his wil, and shouldest see that Iust one, and shouldest heare the voyce of his mouth.

15. For thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men, of the things which thou hast seene and heard.

16. Now therefore why tariest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sinnes, in calling on the Name of the Lord.

17. And it came to passe, that when I was come againe to Hierusalem, and prayed in the Temple, I was in a traunce,

18. And saw him saying vnto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Hierusalem: for they will not receiue thy witnes concerning me.

19. Then I sayd, Lord, they know that I prisoned, and beat in euery Synagogue them that beleeued in thee.

20. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that 

21. Then he sayd vnto me, Depart: for I will send thee farre hence vnto the Gentiles.

22. 
          

23. And as they 

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. Nowe when the Centurion heard it, hee went, and tolde the chiefe captaine, saying, Take heede what thou doest: for this man is a Romane.

27. Then the chiefe captaine came, and sayd to him, Tel me, art thou a Romane? And he said, Yea.

28. And the chiefe captaine answered, With a great summe obtained I this freedome. Then Paul sayd, But I was so borne.

29. Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was 

30. On the next day, because hee would haue knowen the certaintie wherefore he was accused of the Iewes, he loosed him from his bonds, and commaunded the hie Priests and all their Councill to come together: and he brought Paul, and set him before them.

## Acts 23

1. And 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. And they that stood by, sayd, Reuilest thou Gods hie Priest?

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Nowe the night folowing, the Lord stoode by him, and saide, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem, so must thou beare witnesse also at Rome.

12. 
          

13. And they were more then fourtie, which had made this conspiracie.

14. And they came to the chiefe Priestes and Elders, and said, We haue bound our selues with a solemne curse, that wee will eate nothing, vntill we haue slaine Paul.

15. Now therefore ye with the 

16. But when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying awaite, he went, and entred into the castel, and tolde Paul.

17. 
          

18. So hee tooke him, and brought him to the chiefe captaine, and saide, Paul the prisoner called mee vnto him, and prayed mee to bring this yong man vnto thee, which hath some thing to say vnto thee.

19. Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hande, and went apart with him alone, and asked him, What hast thou to shewe me?

20. And he saide, The Iewes haue conspired to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring foorth Paul to morow into the Council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly:

21. But let them not perswade thee: for there lie in waite for him of them, more then fourtie men, which haue bound themselues with a curse, that they will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed him: and nowe are they readie, and waite for thy promes.

22. 
          

23. And he called vnto him two certaine Centurions, saying, Make readie two hundred souldiers, that they may go to Cæsarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and two hundred with dartes, at the thirde houre of the night.

24. And let them make readie an horse, that Paul being set on, may be brought safe vnto Felix the Gouernour.

25. And he wrote an epistle in this maner:

26. 
          

27. As this man was taken of the Iewes, and shoulde haue bene killed of them, I came vpon them with the garison, and rescued him, perceiuing that he was a Romane.

28. And when I would haue knowen the cause, wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Council.

29. There I perceiued that hee was accused of questions of their Lawe, but had no crime worthy of death, or of bondes.

30. And when it was shewed me, how that the Iewes layd waite for the man, I sent him straightway to thee, and commaunded his accusers to speake before thee the thinges that they had against him. Farewell.

31. Then the souldiers as it was commaunded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. And the next day, they left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned vnto the Castel.

33. Now when they came to Cæsarea, they deliuered the epistle to the Gouernour, and presented Paul also vnto him.

34. So when the Gouernour had read it, hee asked of what prouince he was: and when he vnderstoode that he was of Cilicia,

35. I will heare thee, said he, when thine accusers also are come, and commaunded him to bee kept in Herods iudgement hall.

## Acts 24

1. And 

2. And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that 

3. We acknowledge it wholy, and in all places most noble Felix, with all thankes,

4. But that I be not tedious vnto thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldest heare vs of thy courtesie a fewe wordes.

5. For we have found this man [a] 

6. And hath gone about to pollute the Temple: therefore wee tooke him, and woulde haue iudged him according to our Lawe:

7. But the chiefe captaine Lysias came vpon vs, and with great violence tooke him out of our handes,

8. Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest (if thou wilt inquire) know all these things whereof we accuse him.

9. And the Jews also 

10. 
          

11. Seeing that thou mayest knowe, that there are but twelue dayes since I came vp to worship in Hierusalem.

12. And they neither found mee in the Temple disputing with any man, neither making vproare among the people, neither in the Synagogues, nor in the citie.

13. Neither can they 

14. 
          

15. And haue hope towardes God, that the resurrection of the dead, which they themselues looke for also, shalbe both of iust and vniust.

16. And herein I endeuour my selfe to haue alway a cleare conscience towarde God, and toward men.

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. Who ought to haue bene present before thee, and accuse me, if they had ought against me.

20. Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the 

21. Except it be for this one voyce, that I cried standing among them, Of the resurrection of the dead am I accused of you this day.

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife 

25. And as he disputed of righteousnes & temperance, & of the iudgement to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time, and when I haue conuenient time, I will call for thee.

26. Hee hoped also that money shoulde haue bene giuen him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore hee sent for him the oftner, and communed with him.

27. 
          

## Acts 25

1. Now 

2. Then the high Priest, and the chiefe of the Iewes appeared before him against Paul: and they besought him,

3. And desired fauour against him, that hee would send for him to Hierusalem: and they layd waite to kill him by the way.

4. But Festus answered, that Paul should bee kept at Cæsarea, and that he himselfe would shortly depart thither.

5. Let them therefore, saide he, which among you are able, come downe with vs: and if there be any wickednes in the man, let them accuse him.

6. 
          

7. And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which 

8. Forasmuch as he answered, that he had neither offended any thing against the lawe of the Iewes, neither against ye temple, nor against Cæsar.

9. 
          

10. Then said Paul, I stand at Cæsars iudgment seate, where I ought to be iudged: to the Iewes I haue done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.

11. For if I haue done wrong, or committed any thing worthie of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man, to pleasure them, can deliuer me to them: I appeale vnto Cæsar.

12. Then when Festus had spoken with the Council, hee answered, Hast thou appealed vnto Cæsar? vnto Cæsar shalt thou goe.

13. 
          

14. And when they had remained there many dayes, Festus declared Pauls cause vnto the King, saying, There is a certaine man left in prison by Felix,

15. Of whom when I came to Hierusalem, the high Priestes and Elders of the Iewes informed me, and desired to haue iudgement against him.

16. To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to 

17. Therefore when they were come hither, without delay the day following I sate on the iudgement seate, and commaunded the man to be brought foorth.

18. Against whom when the accusers stood vp, they brought no crime of such things as I supposed:

19. 
          

20. And because I doubted of such maner of question, I asked him whether he would goe to Hierusalem, and there be iudged of these things.

21. But because he appealed to be reserued to the examination of Augustus, I commaunded him to be kept, till I mght send him to Cesar.

22. 
          

23. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great 

24. And Festus sayd, King Agrippa, & all men which are present with vs, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue called vpon me, both at Hierusalem, and here, crying, that he ought not to liue any longer.

25. Yet haue I found nothing worthy of death, that he hath committed: neuertheles, seeing that he hath appealed to Augustus, I haue determined to send him.

26. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my 

27. For me thinketh it vnreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to shewe the causes which are layde against him.

## Acts 26

1. Then Agrippa sayd vnto Paul, Thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe. So Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himselfe.

2. 
          

3. Chiefly, because thou hast knowledge of all customes, and questions which are among the Iewes: wherefore I beseech thee, to heare me patiently.

4. 
          

5. Which 

6. 
          

7. Whereunto our twelue tribes instantly seruing God day and night, hope to come: for the which hopes sake, O King Agrippa, I am accused of the Iewes.

8. 
          

9. I also verely thought in my selfe, that I ought to doe many contrarie things against the Name of Iesus of Nazareth.

10. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave 

11. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and 

12. At which time, euen as I went to Damascus with authoritie, and commission from the hie Priests,

13. At midday, O King, I sawe in the way a light from heauen, passing the brightnes of the sunne, shine round about mee, and them which went with me.

14. So when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voyce speaking vnto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kicke against pricks.

15. Then I sayd, Who art thou, Lord? And he sayd, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest.

16. But rise and stand vp on thy feete: for I haue appeared vnto thee for this purpose, to appoint thee a minister and a witnesse, both of the things which thou hast seene, and of the things in the which I will appeare vnto thee,

17. Deliuering thee from this people, and from the Gentiles, vnto whom now I send thee,

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. But shewed first vnto them of Damascus, and at Hierusalem, & throughout all the coasts of Iudea, & then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turne to God, and doe workes worthy amendement of life.

21. For this cause the Iewes caught me in the Temple, and went about to kill me.

22. 
          

23. That Christ should 

24. 
          

25. But he said, I am not mad, O noble Festus, but I speake the wordes of trueth and sobernes.

26. For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a 

27. 
          

28. Then Agrippa said vnto Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to become a Christian.

29. And Paul said, 

30. 
          

31. And when they were gone apart, they talked betweene themselues, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death, nor of bonds.

32. Then sayd Agrippa vnto Festus, This man might haue bene loosed, if hee had not appealed vnto Cesar.

## Acts 27

1. And 

2. And we entred into a ship of Adramyttium purposing to saile by the coastes of Asia, and launched foorth, and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a Thessalonian, with vs.

3. And the next day we arriued at Sidon: and Iulius courteously entreated Paul, and gaue him libertie to go vnto his friends, that they might refresh him.

4. And from thence we launched, and sayled hard by Cyprus, because ye windes were contrarie.

5. Then sayled we ouer the sea by Cilicia, and Pamphilia, and came to Myra, a citie in Lycia.

6. And there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sayling into Italie, and put vs therein.

7. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against 

8. And with much adoe sayled beyond it, and came vnto a certaine place called the Faire hauens, neere vnto the which was the citie Lasea.

9. 
          

10. And sayde vnto them, Syrs, I see that this voiage will be with hurt & much damage, not of the lading and ship onely, but also of our liues.

11. 
          

12. And because the hauen was not commodious to winter in, many tooke counsell to depart thence, if by any meanes they might attaine to Phenice, there to winter, which is an hauen of Candie, and lyeth toward the Southwest and by West, and Northwest and by West.

13. And when the Southerne winde blew softly, they supposing to atteine their purpose, loosed neerer, and sailed by Candie.

14. But not long after there arose against 

15. And when the ship was caught, and could not resist the winde, we let her goe, and were caried away.

16. And we ran vnder a litle Yle named Clauda, and had much a doe to get the boat.

17. Which they tooke vp and vsed all helpe, vndergirding the ship, fearing least they should haue fallen into Syrtes, and they strake saile, and so were caried.

18. 
          

19. And the third day we cast out with our owne hands the tackling of the ship.

20. And when neither sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared, and no small tempest lay vpon vs, all hope that we should be saued, was then taken away.

21. 
          

22. But now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shalbe no losse of any mans life among you, saue of the ship onely.

23. For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whome I serue,

24. Saying, Feare not, Paul: for thou must be brought before Cesar: and lo, God hath giuen vnto thee freely all that sayle with thee.

25. 
          

26. Howbeit, we must be cast into a certaine Iland.

27. 
          

28. And sounded, & found it twentie fathoms: and when they had gone a litle further, they sounded againe, and found fifteene fathoms.

29. Then fearing least they should haue fallen into some rough places, they cast foure ancres out of the sterne, and wished that the day were come.

30. 
          

31. 
          

32. Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall away.

33. 
          

34. Wherefore I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an 

35. And when he had thus spoken, hee tooke bread and gaue thankes to God, in presence of them all, and brake it, and began to eate.

36. Then were they all of good courage, and they also tooke meate.

37. Nowe we were in the ship in all two hundreth three score and sixteene soules.

38. And whe they had eaten ynough, they lightened the ship, & cast out the wheat into the sea.

39. 
          

40. So when they had taken vp the ankers, they committed the ship vnto the sea, and loosed the rudder bonds, and hoised vp the maine saile to the winde, and drewe to the shore.

41. And falling into a place where

2. And the Barbarians shewed vs no litle kindnesse: for they kindled a fire, and receiued vs euery one, because of the present showre, and because of the colde.

3.

5. But he shooke off the worme into the fire, and felt no harme.

8. And so it was, that the father of Publius lay sicke of the feauer, and of a bloodie flixe: to whom Paul entred in, and when he prayed, he laide his hands on him, and healed him.

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. And when we arriued at Syracuse, we taried there three dayes.

13. And from thence we set a compasse, and came to Rhegium: and after one day, the South wind blewe, and we came the seconde day to Putioli:

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by

18. Who when they had examined me, would haue let me goe, because there was no cause of death in me.

19. 
          

20. For this cause therefore haue I called for you, to see you, and to speake with you: for that hope of Israels sake, I am bound with this chaine.

21. Then they saide vnto him, We neither receiued letters out of Iudea concerning thee, neither came any of the brethren that shewed or spake any euill of thee.

22. But we will heare of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we knowe that euery where it is spoken against.

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. Therefore when they agreed not among themselues, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, to wit, Well spake the holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet vnto our fathers,

26. 
          

27. For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they
