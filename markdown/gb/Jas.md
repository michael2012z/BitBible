1. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. But let him ask in faith, 

7. Neither let that man thinke that hee shall receiue any thing of the Lord.

8. A double minded man [is] unstable in 

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his 

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. But euery man is tempted, when hee is drawen away by his owne concupiscence, and is entised.

15. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth 

16. 
          

17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the 

18. 
          

19. Wherefore my deare brethren, let euery man be swift to heare, slowe to speake, and slowe to wrath.

20. For the wrath of man worketh not the 

21. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with 

22. 
          

23. 
          

24. For when he hath considered himselfe, hee goeth his way, and forgetteth immediately what maner of one he was.

25. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his 

26. 
          

27. 
          

## James 2

1. My 

2. For if there come into your copany a man with a golde ring, and in goodly apparell, and there come in also a poore man in vile raiment,

3. And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a 

4. Are ye not then partial in 

5. 
          

6. But ye have despised the poor. 

7. Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are 

8. 
          

9. But if yee regarde the persons, yee commit sinne, and are rebuked of the Lawe, as transgressours.

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no 

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. And one of you say vnto them, Depart in peace: warme your selues, and fil your bellies, notwithstading ye giue them not those things which are needefull to the body, what helpeth it?

17. Euen so the faith, if it haue no woorkes, is dead in it selfe.

18. Yea, 

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. Was not Abraham our father 

22. Seest thou how faith 

23. And the scripture was 

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. 
          

## James 3

1. My 

2. For in many things we offend all. 

3. 
          

4. Behold also the shippes, which though they be so great, and are driuen of fierce windes, yet are they turned about with a very small rudder, whither soeuer the gouernour listeth.

5. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. 

6. And the tongue [is] a fire, a 

7. For the whole nature of beasts, & of birds, and of creeping things, and things of the sea is tamed, and hath bene tamed of the nature of man.

8. But the tongue can no man tame. It is an vnruly euill, full of deadly poyson.

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Doeth a fountaine send forth at one place sweete water and bitter?

12. Can ye figge tree, my brethren, bring forth oliues, either a vine figges? so can no fountaine make both salt water and sweete.

13. 
          

14. But if ye haue bitter enuying and strife in your hearts, reioyce not, neither be liars against the trueth.

15. This wisedome descendeth not from aboue, but is earthly, sensuall, and deuilish.

16. For where enuying and strife is, there is sedition, and all maner of euill workes.

17. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of 

18. 
          

## James 4

1. From 

2. Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, 

3. Ye aske, and receiue not, because ye aske amisse, that ye might lay the same out on your pleasures.

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. But the Scripture offereth more grace, and therefore sayth, God resisteth the proude, and giueth grace to the humble.

7. 
          

8. Drawe neere to God, and he will drawe nere to you. Clense your handes, ye sinners, and purge your hearts, ye double minded.

9. 
          

10. Cast downe your selues before the Lord, and he will lift you vp.

11. 
          

12. There is one Lawgiuer, which is able to saue, and to destroy. Who art thou that iudgest another man?

13. 
          

14. (And yet ye cannot tell what shalbe to morowe. For what is your life? It is euen a vapour that appeareth for a litle time, and afterward vanisheth away)

15. For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, and, if we liue, we will doe this or that.

16. But nowe ye reioyce in your boastings: all such reioycing is euill.

17. 
          

## James 5

1. Go 

2. Your riches are corrupt, and your garments are moth eaten.

3. Your gold and siluer is cankred, & the rust of them shalbe a witnesse against you, and shall eate your flesh, as it were fire. Ye haue heaped vp treasure for the last dayes.

4. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the 

5. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have 

6. Ye haue condemned and haue killed the iust, and he hath not resisted you.

7. 
          

8. Be ye also patient therefore and settle your hearts: for ye comming of the Lord draweth nere.

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the 

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed 

16. 
          

17. Helias was a man subiect to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rayne, and it rayned not on the earth for three yeeres and sixe moneths.

18. And he prayed againe, and the heauen gaue rayne, and the earth brought forth her fruite.

19. 
          

20. Let him knowe that he which hath conuerted the sinner from going astray out of his way, shall saue a soule from death, and shal hide a multitude of sinnes.
