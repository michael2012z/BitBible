## Habakkuk 1

1. The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw. 

2. O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out to thee 

3. Why doest thou shewe mee iniquitie, and cause me to beholde sorowe? for spoyling, and violence are before me: and there are that rayse vp strife and contention.

4. Therefore the law is feeble, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth 

5. Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] 

6. For lo, I raise vp the Caldeans, that bitter & furious nation, which shall goe vpon the breadth of the lande to possesse the dwelling places, that are not theirs.

7. They [are] terrible and dreadful: 

8. Their horses also are swifter then the leopards, and are more fierce then the wolues in the euening: and their horsemen are many: & their horsemen shall come from farre: they shall flie as the eagle hasting to meate.

9. They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the 

10. And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap 

11. Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall 

12. [Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall not 

13. Thou art of pure eyes, and canst not see euill: thou canst not behold wickednesse: wherefore doest thou looke vpon the transgressors, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked deuoureth the man, that is more righteous then he?

14. And makest men as the 

15. They take vp all with the angle: they catch it in their net, and gather it in their yarne, whereof they reioyce and are glad.

16. Therefore they sacrifice to their 

17. Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay 

## Habakkuk 2

1. I will stand upon my 

2. And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain upon tablets, that he may run 

3. For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the 

4. Behold, 

5. Yea also, because 

6. Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! 

7. Shall 

8. Because thou hast spoyled many nations, all the remnant of the people shal spoyle thee, because of mens blood, and for the wrong done in the land, in the citie, and vnto all that dwell therein.

9. Ho, he that coueteth an euil couetousnesse to his house, that he may set his nest on hie, to escape from the power of euil.

10. Thou 

11. For the 

12. Wo vnto him that buildeth a towne with blood, and erecteth a citie by iniquitie.

13. Behold, [is it] not from the 

14. For the earth shall 

15. Woe to him that giveth his neighbour 

16. Thou art filled with shame 

17. For the 

18. What profiteth the graven 

19. Woe to him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! 

20. But the Lord is in his holy Temple: let all the earth keepe silence before him.

## Habakkuk 3

1. A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet 

2. 
          

3. God came from 

4. And [his] brightness was as the light; 

5. Before him went the pestilence, and burning coales went forth before his feete.

6. He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his 

7. 
          

8. Was the LORD displeased against the 

9. Thy 

10. The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the water 

11. The 

12. Thou trodest downe the land in anger, and didest thresh the heathen in displeasure.

13. Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, [even] for salvation with thy 

14. Thou didst 

15. Thou didest walke in the sea with thine horses vpon the heape of great waters.

16. When I 

17. For the figtree shall not flourish, neither shall fruite be in the vines: the labour of the oliue shall faile, and the fieldes shall yeelde no meate: the sheepe shalbe cut off from the folde, and there shalbe no bullocke in the stalles.

18. Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy 

19. The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and he will make me to walk upon my high places.
