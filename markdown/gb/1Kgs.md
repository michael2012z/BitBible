1. Now king David was 

2. Wherefore his seruants saide vnto him, Let there be sought for my lord ye King a yong virgin, and let her stand before the King, and cherish him: and let her lie in thy bosome, that my lord the King may get heate.

3. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag 

4. And the maid was exceeding faire, and cherished the King, and ministred to him, but the King knew her not.

5. Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and 

6. And his father would not displease him from his childehood, to say, Why hast thou done so? And hee was a very goodly man, and his mother bare him next after Absalom.

7. And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah 

8. But Zadok the Priest, & Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the men of might, which were with Dauid, were not with Adoniiah.

9. Then Adoniiah sacrificed sheepe and oxen, and fat cattel by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the kings sonnes, & al the men of Iudah ye Kings seruants,

10. But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and 

11. Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath-sheba the mother of Salomon, saying, Hast thou not heard, that Adoniiah ye sonne of Haggith doeth reigne, and Dauid our lord knoweth it not?

12. Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own 

13. Go, and get thee in vnto King Dauid, and say vnto him, Didest not thou, my lorde, O King, sweare vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomo thy sonne shall reigne after me, & he shal sit vpon my throne? why is then Adoniiah King?

14. Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and 

15. So Bath-sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber, and the King was verie olde, and Abishag the Shunammite ministred vnto ye King.

16. And Bath-sheba bowed and made obeisance vnto the King; the King saide, What is thy matter?

17. And shee answered him, My lorde, thou swarest by the Lorde thy God vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my throne.

18. And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest 

19. And he hath offred many oxen, and fatte cattel, and sheepe, and hath called all the sonnes of the King, and Abiathar the Priest, and Ioab the captaine of the hoste: but Salomon thy seruant hath he not bidden.

20. And thou, my lorde, O King, knowest that the eyes of all Israel are on thee, that thou shouldest tell them, who shoulde sit on the throne of my lord the King after him.

21. Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be 

22. And lo, while she yet talked with the King, Nathan also the Prophet came in.

23. And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face 

24. And Nathan saide, My lorde, O King, hast thou said, Adoniiah shall reigne after mee, and he shall sit vpon my throne?

25. For hee is gone downe this day, and hath slaine many oxen, and fat cattel, and sheepe, and hath called al the Kings sonnes, and the captaines of the hoste, and Abiathar the Priest: and behold, they eate and drinke before him, and say, God saue King Adoniiah.

26. But me thy seruant, and Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and thy seruant Salomon hath he not called.

27. Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed [it] unto thy 

28. Then King Dauid answered, and saide, Call me Bath-sheba; shee came into ye Kings presence, and stoode before the King.

29. And the King sware, saying, As the Lorde liueth, who hath redeemed my soule out of all aduersitie,

30. Even as I 

31. Then Bath-sheba bowed her face to the earth, and did reuerence vnto the King, and said, God saue my lord King Dauid for euer.

32. And King Dauid saide, Call mee Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada; they came before the King.

33. The king also said unto them, Take with you the 

34. And let Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet anoint him there King ouer Israel, and blowe ye the trumpet, and say, God saue king Salomon.

35. Then come vp after him, that hee may come and sit vpon my throne: and hee shall bee King in my steade: for I haue appointed him to be prince ouer Israel and ouer Iudah.

36. Then Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada answered the King, and said, So be it, and the Lord God of my lord the King ratifie it.

37. As the Lord hath bene with my lorde the King, so be he with Salomon, and exalt his throne aboue the throne of my lorde king Dauid.

38. So Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went downe and caused Salomon to ride vpon king Dauids mule, and brought him to Gihon.

39. And Zadok the priest took an horn of 

40. And all the people came vp after him, and the people piped with pipes, and reioyced with great ioye, so that the earth rang with the sound of them.

41. And Adoniiah and all the ghestes that were with him, heard it: (and they had made an ende of eating) and when Ioab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What meaneth this noise and vprore in the citie?

42. And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou [art] a valiant man, and bringest 

43. And Ionathan answered, and said to Adoniiah, Verely our lord King Dauid hath made Salomon King.

44. And the King hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they haue caused him to ride vpon the Kings mule.

45. And Zadok the Priest, and Nathan ye Prophet haue anointed him King in Gihon: and they are gone vp from thence with ioy, and the citie is moued: this is the noise that ye haue heard.

46. And Salomon also sitteth on the throne of the kingdome.

47. And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the 

48. And thus sayd the King also, Blessed bee the Lorde God of Israel, who hath made one to sit on my throne this day, euen in my sight.

49. Then all the ghestes that were with Adonijah, were afraide, and rose vp, and went euery man his way.

50. And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the 

51. And one tolde Salomon, saying, Beholde, Adonijah doeth feare King Salomon: for lo, he hath caught holde on the hornes of the altar, saying, Let King Salomon sweare vnto me this day, that he will not slay his seruant with the sword.

52. Then Salomon sayd, If he will shewe him selfe a worthy man, there shall not an heare of him fall to the earth, but if wickednes be found in him, he shall dye.

53. Then King Salomon sent, & they brought him from the altar, and he came and did obeisance vnto King Salomon; Salomon sayde vnto him, Go to thine house.

## 1 Kings 2

1. Then the dayes of Dauid drewe neere that he should die, and hee charged Salomon his sonne, saying,

2. I go the 

3. And keep the 

4. That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in 

5. Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, [and] what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and 

6. Doe therefore according to thy wisdome, and let thou not his hoare head go downe to the graue in peace.

7. But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: 

8. And beholde, with thee is Shimei the sonne of Gera, the sonne of Iemini, of Bahurim, which cursed mee with an horrible curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but hee came downe to meete me at Iorden, & I sware to him by the Lorde, saying, I will not slay thee with the sword.

9. Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou [art] a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with 

10. So Dauid slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid.

11. And the dayes which Dauid reigned vpon Israel, were fourtie yeeres: seuen yeeres reigned he in Hebron, and thirtie & three yeeres reigned he in Ierusalem.

12. Then sate Salomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was stablished mightily.

13. And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, 

14. He said moreouer, I haue a sute vnto thee; she sayd, Say on.

15. And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and [that] all Israel 

16. Nowe therefore I aske thee one request, refuse me not; she said vnto him, Say on.

17. And he sayd, Speake, I pray thee, vnto Salomon ye King, (for he will not say thee nay) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.

18. And Bath-sheba sayd, Well, I will speake for thee vnto the King.

19. Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and 

20. Then she sayd, I desire a small request of thee, say me not nay. Then the King sayde vnto her, Aske on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.

21. She sayd then, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adonijah thy brother to wife.

22. And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the 

23. Then King Salomon sware by the Lorde, saying, God doe so to me and more also, if Adoniiah hath not spoken this worde against his owne life.

24. Now therefore as ye Lord liueth, who hath established me, & set me on the throne of Dauid my father, who also hath made me an house, as he promised, Adoniiah shall surely die this day.

25. And King Salomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and hee smote him that he dyed.

26. And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou [art] worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou

31. And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and 

32. And the Lorde shall bring his blood vpon his owne head: for he smote two men more righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, & my father Dauid knew not: to wit, Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether captaine of the hoste of Iudah.

33. Their blood shall therefore return upon the 

34. So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, & smote him, and slewe him, & he was buryed in his owne house in the wildernesse.

35. And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the 

36. Afterwarde the King sent, & called Shimei, and sayde vnto him, Buylde thee an house in Ierusalem, and dwell there, and depart not thence any whither.

37. For that day that thou goest out, and passest ouer the riuer of Kidron, knowe assuredly, that thou shalt dye the death: thy blood shall be vpon thine owne head.

38. And Shimei sayd vnto the King, The thing is good: as my lord the King hath sayd, so wil thy seruant doe. So Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many dayes.

39. And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the

41. And it was tolde Salomon, that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath, and was come againe.

42. And the King sent and called Shimei, and sayde vnto him, Did I not make thee to sweare by the Lorde, and protested vnto thee, saying, That day that thou goest out, and walkest any whither, knowe assuredly that thou shalt dye the death? And thou saydest vnto mee, The thing is good, that I haue heard.

43. Why then hast thou not kept the othe of the Lorde, and the commandement wherewith I charged thee?

44. The king said moreover to Shimei, 

45. And let King Salomon be blessed, and the throne of Dauid stablished before the Lorde for euer.

46. So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was

8. And thy seruant is in the mids of thy people, which thou hast chosen, euen a great people which cannot be told nor nobred for multitude.

9. Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so 

10. And this pleased the Lorde wel, that Salomon had desired this thing.

11. And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine 

12. Beholde, I haue done according to thy wordes: lo, I haue giuen thee a wise and an vnderstanding heart, so that there hath bene none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall arise the like vnto thee.

13. And I haue also giuen thee that, which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour, so that among the Kings there shall be none like vnto thee all thy dayes.

14. And if thou wilt walke in my wayes, to keepe mine ordinances & my commandements, as thy father Dauid did walke, I will prolong thy dayes.

15. And Solomon awoke; and, behold, [it was] 

16. Then came there two women, [that were] harlots, unto the king, and 

17. And the one woman sayd, Oh my lorde, I and this woman dwell in one house, and I was deliuered of a childe with her in the house.

22. Then the other woman sayd, Nay, but my sonne liueth, and thy sonne is dead. Againe she sayde, No, but thy sonne is dead, and mine aliue: thus they spake before the King.

23. Then sayde the King, She sayth, This that liueth is my sonne, and the dead is thy sonne: and the other sayth, Nay, but the dead is thy sonne, and the liuing is my sonne.

24. And the king said, 

25. And the King sayde, Deuide ye the liuing child in twaine, & giue the one halfe to the one, and the other halfe to the other.

26. Then spake the woman whose the living child [was] unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and 

27. Then the King answered, and sayde, Giue her the liuing childe, and slay him not: this is his mother.

28. And all Israel heard the iudgement, which the King had iudged, and they feared the King: for they sawe that the wisedome of God was in him to doe iustice.

12. And the great court round about [was] with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, 

13. Then King Salomon sent, and set one Hiram out of Tyrus.

14. He [was] a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and 

15. For he cast two pillars of brasse: ye height of a pillar was eighteene cubites, and a threede of twelue cubites did compasse either of ye pillars.

16. And he made two chapiters of molten brasse to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of one of the chapiters was fiue cubites, and the height of the other chapiter was fiue cubites.

17. He made grates like networke, and wrethen worke like chaynes for the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars, euen seuen for the one chapiter, and seuen for the other chapiter.

18. So he made the pillars and two rowes of pomegranates round about in the one grate to couer the chapiters that were vpon the top; thus did he for the other chapiter.

19. And the chapiters that [were] upon the top of the pillars [were] of 

20. And the chapiters vpon the two pillars had also aboue, ouer against the belly within the networke pomegranates: for two hudreth pomegranates were in the two rankes about vpon either of the chapiters.

21. And he set up the pillars in the 

22. And vpon the top of the pillars was worke of lilyes: so was the workemanship of the pillars finished.

23. And he made a molten 

24. And vnder the brimme of it were knoppes like wilde cucumers compassing it round about, ten in one cubite, compassing the sea round about: and the two rowes of knoppes were cast, when it was molten.

25. It stoode on twelue bulles, three looking towarde the North, and three toward the West, and three toward the South, and three towarde the East: and the sea stoode aboue vpon them, and all their hinder partes were inward.

26. And it [was] an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand 

27. And he made tenne bases of brasse, one base was foure cubites long, and foure cubites broad, and three cubites hie.

28. And the worke of the bases was on this maner, They had borders, and the borders were betweene the ledges:

29. And on the borders that were betweene the ledges, were lyons, bulles and Cherubims: and vpon the ledges there was a base aboue: and beneath the lyons and bulles, were addicions made of thinne worke.

30. And euery base had foure brasen wheeles, and plates of brasse: and the foure corners had vndersetters: vnder the caldron were vndersetters molten at the side of euery addicion.

31. And the 

32. And vnder the borders were foure wheeles, and the axeltrees of the wheeles ioyned to the base: and the height of a wheele was a cubite and halfe a cubite.

33. And the facion of the wheeles was like the facion of a charet wheele, their axeltrees, and their naues and their felloes, and their spokes were all molten.

34. And foure vndersetters were vpon the foure corners of one base: and the vndersetters thereof were of the base it selfe.

35. And in the top of the base [was there] a round 

36. And vpon the tables of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof he did graue Cherubims, lions and palmetrees, on the side of euery one, and addicions round about.

37. Thus made he the tenne bases, They had all one casting, one measure, and one syse.

38. Then made he 

39. And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the 

40. And Hiram made caldrons, and besomes, & basens, & Hiram finished all the worke that he made to King Salomon for the house of ye Lord:

41. To wit, two pillars and two bowles of the chapiters that were on the toppe of the two pillars, and two grates to couer the two bowles of the chapiters which were vpon the toppe of the pillars,

42. And foure hundreth pomegranates for the two grates, euen two rowes of pomegranates for euery grate to couer the two bowles of the chapiters, that were vpon the pillars,

43. And the ten bases, and ten caldrons vpon the bases,

44. And the sea, and twelue bulles vnder that sea,

45. And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which 

46. In the plaine of Iorden did the King cast them in clay betweene Succoth and Zarthan.

47. And Salomon left to weigh all the vessels because of the exceeding aboundance, neyther could the weight of the brasse be counted.

48. And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] unto the house of the LORD: the 

49. And the candlestickes, fiue at the right side, and fiue at the left, before the oracle of pure gold, and the flowres, and the lampes, and the snuffers of golde,

50. And the bowls, 

51. So was finished all the worke that King Salomon made for the house of the Lorde, and Salomon brought in the things which Dauid his father had dedicated: the siluer and the golde and the vessels, and layed them among the treasures of the house of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 8

1. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might 

2. And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month 

3. And all the Elders of Israel came and the Priests tooke the Arke.

4. They bare the Arke of the Lorde, and they bare the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle: those did the Priestes and Leuites bring vp.

5. And King Salomon and all the Congregation of Israel, that were assembled vnto him, were with him before the Arke, offering sheepe and beeues, which could not be tolde, nor nombred for multitude.

6. And the 

7. For ye Cherubims stretched out their wings ouer the place of the Arke, and the Cherubims couered the Arke, and the barres thereof aboue.

8. And they 

9. [There was] nothing in the ark 

10. And when the Priestes were come out of the Sanctuarie, the cloude filled the house of the Lorde,

11. So that the Priestes could not stande to minister, because of the cloude: for the glorie of the Lorde had filled the house of the Lorde.

12. Then spake Salomon, The Lord said, that he woulde dwell in the darke cloude.

13. I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for 

14. And the King turned his face, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel: for all the Congregation of Israel stoode there.

15. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,

16. Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no citie of all the tribes of Israel, to builde an house that my name might be there: but I haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel.

17. And it was in ye heart of Dauid my father to builde an house to the Name of the Lorde God of Israel.

18. And the Lord said vnto Dauid my father, Where as it was in thine heart to build an house vnto my Name, thou diddest well, that thou wast so minded:

19. Neuerthelesse thou shalt not builde the house, but thy sonne that shall come out of thy loynes, he shall builde the house vnto my Name.

20. And the Lorde hath made good his worde that he spake: and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and haue built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel.

21. And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein [is] the 

22. Then Salomon stoode before the altar of the Lorde in the sight of all the Congregation of Israel, and stretched out his handes towarde heauen,

23. And he said, LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with 

24. Thou that hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him: for thou spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hande, as appeareth this day.

25. Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father that thou hast promised him, saying, Thou shalt not want a man in my sight to sit vpon ye throne of Israel: so that thy childre take heed to their way, that they walke before me; as thou hast walked in my sight

26. And nowe, O God of Israel, I pray thee, let thy worde be verified, which thou spakest vnto thy seruant Dauid my father.

27. 
          

28. But haue thou respect vnto the prayer of thy seruant, and to his supplication, O Lorde, my God, to heare the cry and prayer which thy seruant prayeth before thee this day:

29. That thine eyes may be open toward this house, night and day, euen towarde the place whereof thou hast said, My Name shalbe there: that thou mayest hearken vnto the prayer which thy seruant prayeth in this place.

30. Heare thou therefore the supplication of thy seruant, and of thy people Israel, which pray in this place, & heare thou in the place of thine habitation, euen in heauen, and when thou hearest, haue mercie.

31. If any man trespass against his neighbour, 

32. Then hear thou in heaven, and 

33. When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and 

34. Then heare thou in heauen, and be mercifull vnto the sinne of thy people Israel, and bring them againe vnto the lande, which thou gauest vnto their fathers.

35. When heaven is 

36. Then heare thou in heauen, and pardon the sinne of thy seruants and of thy people Israel (when thou hast taught the the good way wherein they may walke) and giue raine vpon the land that thou hast giuen to thy people to inherite.

37. When there shalbe famine in the land, when there shalbe pestilence, when there shall be blasting, mildewe, grashopper or caterpiller, when their enemie shall besiege them in the cities of their lande, or any plague, or any sickenesse,

38. What prayer and supplication soever be [made] by any man, [or] by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own 

39. Heare thou then in heauen, in thy dwelling place, and be mercifull, and doe, and giue euery man according to all his wayes, as thou knowest his heart, (for thou only knowest the heartes of all the children of men)

40. That they may feare thee as long as they liue in ye lad, which thou gauest vnto our fathers.

41. Moreover concerning a 

42. (When they shal heare of thy great name, and of thy mightie hande, and of thy stretched out arme) and shall come and pray in this house,

43. Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy 

44. When thy people shall go out to battell against their enemie by the way that thou shalt sende them, and shall pray vnto the Lorde towarde the way of the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I haue built for thy Name,

45. Heare thou then in heauen their prayer & their supplication, and iudge their cause.

46. If they sinne against thee, ( for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliuer them vnto the enemies, so that they cary them away prisoners vnto the land of the enemies, either farre or neere,

47. [Yet] if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee 

48. And [so] return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward 

49. Then heare thou their prayer and their supplication in heauen thy dwelling place, and iudge their cause,

50. And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may 

51. For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt from the middes of the yron fornace.

52. Let thine eyes be open vnto the prayer of thy seruant, and vnto the prayer of thy people Israel, to hearken vnto them, in all that they call for vnto thee.

53. For thou diddest separate them to thee from among all people of the earth for an inheritance, as thou saidest by the hand of Moses thy seruant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.

54. And it was [so], that when Solomon had made an 

55. And stoode and blessed all the Congregation of Israel with a loud voyce, saying,

56. Blessed be the Lorde that hath giuen rest vnto his people Israel, according to all that hee promised: there hath not fayled one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his seruant.

57. The Lorde our God be with vs, as he was with our fathers, that he forsake vs not, neither leaue vs,

58. That he may 

59. And these my wordes, which I haue prayed before the Lorde, be neere vnto the Lorde our God day and night, that he defende the cause of his seruant, and the cause of his people Israel alway as the matter requireth,

60. That all the people of ye earth may knowe, that the Lord is God, and none other.

61. Let your heart therefore be perfit with the Lorde our God to walke in his statutes, and to keepe his commandements, as this day.

62. Then the King and all Israel with him offred sacrifice before the Lorde.

63. And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the 

64. The same day did the King halowe the middle of the court, that was before the house of the Lorde: for there he made burnt offerings, and the meate offrings, and the fat of the peace offeringes, because the brasen altar that was before the Lorde, was too litle to receiue the burnt offerings, and the meate offerings, and the fat of the peace offrings.

65. And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of 

66. And the eight day he sent the people away: and they thanked the King and went vnto their tentes ioyous and with glad heart, because of al the goodnesse that the Lord had done for Dauid his seruant, and for Israel his people.

## 1 Kings 9

1. When Salomon had finished the building of the house of ye Lorde, & the kings palace, & all that Salomon desired and minded to do,

2. Then the Lorde appeared vnto Salomon the second time, as he appeared vnto him at Gibeon.

3. And the Lord sayd vnto him, I haue heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I haue halowed this house (which thou hast built) to put my Name there for euer, and mine eyes, and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

4. And 

5. Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer, as I promised to Dauid thy father, saying, Thou shalt not wat a man vpon the throne of Israel.

6. [But] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will 

7. Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a 

8. Euen this hie house shall bee so: euery one that passeth by it, shalbe astonied, and shall hisse, and they shal say, Why hath the Lord done thus vnto this land and to this house?

9. And they shall answere, Because they forsooke the Lorde their God, which brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and haue taken holde vpon other gods, & haue worshipped them, and serued them, therfore hath the Lord brought vpon them all this euill.

10. And at the ende of twentie yeeres, when Salomon had buylded the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the Kings palace,

11. (For the which Hiram the King of Tyrus had brought to Salomon timber of cedar, and firre trees, and golde, and whatsoeuer he desired) then King Salomon gaue to Hiram twentie cities in the land of Galil.

12. And Hiram came out from Tyrus to see the cities which Salomon had giuen him, & they pleased him not.

13. Therefore hee sayde, What cities are these which thou hast giuen me, my brother? And hee called them the land of Cabul vnto this day.

14. And Hiram sent to the king 

15. And this [is] the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and 

16. Pharaoh King of Egypt had come vp, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slew the Canaanites, that dwelt in the citie, and gaue it for a present vnto his daughter Salomons wife.

17. (Therefore Salomon builte Gezer and Beth-horon the nether,

18. And Baalath and Tamor in the wildernes of the land,

19. And all the cities 

20. [And] all the people [that were] 

21. To wit, their children that were left after them in the lande, whome the children of Israel were not able to destroy, those did Salomo make tributaries vnto this day.

22. But of the children of Israel did Salomon make no bondmen: but they were men of warre and his seruants, and his princes, & his captaines, and rulers of his charets and his horsemen.

23. These [were] the chief of the officers that [were] over Solomon's work, 

24. And Pharaohs daughter came vp from the citie of Dauid vnto the house which Salomon had built for her: then did he buylde Millo.

25. And thrise a yere did Salomon offer burnt offringes and peace offrings vpon the altar which he built vnto the Lord: and hee burnt incense vpon the altar that was before the Lorde, when hee had finished the house.

26. Also King Salomon made a nauie of ships in Ezeon-geber, which is beside Eloth, and the brinke of the red Sea, in the land of Edom.

27. And Hiram sent with the nauie his seruats, that were mariners, and had knowledge of the sea, with the seruants of Salomon.

28. And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold,

1. And when the queen of 

2. And she came to Ierusalem with a verie great traine, and camels that bare sweete odours, and golde exceeding much, and precious stones: and shee came to Salomon, & communed with him of all that was in her heart.

3. And Salomon declared vnto her all her questions: nothing was hid from the King, which he expounded not vnto her.

4. Then the Queene of Sheba sawe all Salomons wisedome, and the house that he had built,

5. And the 

6. And shee sayde vnto the King, It was a true worde that I heard in mine owne lande of thy sayings, and of thy wisedome.

7. Howebeit I beleeued not this report till I came, & had seene it with mine eyes: but lo, ye one halfe was not tolde mee: for thou hast more wisedome & prosperitie, then I haue heard by report.

8. Happy [are] thy men, happy [are] these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, [and] that hear thy

11. The nauie also of Hiram (that caried gold from Ophir) brought likewise great plentie of Almuggim trees from Ophir & precious stones.

12. And the King made of ye Almuggim trees pillars for the house of the Lord, and for ye Kings palace, and made harpes and psalteries for singers. There came no more such Almuggim trees, nor were any more seene vnto this day.

13. And King Salomo gaue vnto the Queene of Sheba, whatsoeuer she would aske, besides that, which Salomon gaue her of his kingly liberalitie: so she returned and went to her owne countrey, both shee, and her seruantes.

14. Also the weight of golde, that came to Salomon in one yeere, was sixe hundreth three score and six talents of gold,

15. Beside [that he had] of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the 

16. And King Salomon made two hundreth targets of beaten golde, sixe hundreth shekels of gold went to a target:

17. And three hundreth shieldes of beaten golde, three pound of gold went to one shielde: and the King put them in the house of the wood of Lebanon.

18. Then the King made a great throne of yuorie, and couered it with the best golde.

19. The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne [was] round behind: and [there were] 

20. And there stoode twelue lions on the sixe steps on either side: there was not the like made in any kingdome.

21. And all King Salomons drinking vessels were of golde, and all the vessels of the house of the woode of Lebanon were of pure golde, none were of siluer: for it was nothing esteemed in the dayes of Salomon.

22. For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of 

23. So King Salomon exceeded all the kings of the earth both in riches and in wisedome.

24. And al the world sought to see Salomon, to heare his wisedome, which God had put in his heart,

25. And they brought euery man his present, vessels of siluer, and vessels of golde, and raiment, and armour, and sweete odours, horses & mules, from yeere to yeere.

26. Then Salomon gathered together charrets and horsemen: and he had a thousand and foure hundreth charets, and twelue thousande horsemen, whome hee placed in the charet cities, and with the King at Ierusalem.

27. And the King gaue siluer in Ierusalem as stones, and gaue cedars as the wilde figtrees that growe abundantly in the plaine.

28. Also Salomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and fine linen: the Kings marchants receiued the linen for a price.

29. There came vp & went out of Egypt some charet, worth sixe hundreth shekels of siluer: that is, one horse, an hundreth and fiftie and thus they brought horses to all the Kings of the Hittites and to the Kings of Aram by their meanes.

## 1 Kings 11

1. But king Solomon loved many 

2. Of the nations, whereof the Lord had sayd vnto the children of Israel, Goe not ye in to them, nor let them come in to you: for surely they will turne your hearts after their gods, to them, I say, did Salomon ioyne in loue.

3. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred 

4. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not 

5. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after 

6. So Salomon wrought wickednesse in the sight of the Lord, but continued not to followe the Lord, as did Dauid his father.

7. Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the 

8. And so did he for all his outlandish wiues, which burnt incense and offered vnto their gods.

9. Therefore the Lord was angry with Salomon, because hee had turned his heart from the Lorde God of Israel, which had appeared vnto him twise,

10. And had giuen him a charge concerning this thing, that he should not follow other gods: but he kept not that, which the Lorde had commaunded him.

11. Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as 

12. Notwithstanding in thy dayes I will not doe it, because of Dauid thy father, but I will rent it out of the hand of thy sonne:

13. Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; [but] will give one

19. And Hadad 

20. And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his sonne, whome Tahpenes wayned in Pharaohs house: and Genubath was in Pharaohs house among the sonnes of Pharaoh.

21. And when Hadad heard in Egypt, that Dauid slept with his fathers, and that Ioab the captaine of the hoste was dead, Hadad sayde to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may goe to mine owne countrey.

22. But Pharaoh saide vnto him, What hast thou lacked with me, that thou wouldest thus go to thine owne countrey? And he answered, Nothing, but in any wise let me goe.

23. And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which 

24. And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, 

25. Therefore was he an aduersarie to Israel all the daies of Salomon: besides the euil that Hadad did, he also abhorred Israel, & reigned ouer Aram

26. And Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat an Ephrathite of Zereda Salomons seruant (whose mother was called Zeruah a widowe) lift vp his hand against the King.

27. And this was the cause that he lift vp his hande against the King, When Salomon built Millo, he repared the broken places of the citie of Dauid his father.

28. And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him 

29. And at that time, when Ieroboam went out of Ierusalem, the Prophet Ahiiah the Shilonite founde him in the way, hauing a newe garment on him, and they two were alone in ye field.

30. And Ahijah caught the new garment that [was] on him, and 

31. And said to Ieroboam, Take vnto thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lorde God of Israel, Beholde, I wil rent the kingdome out of ye hands of Salomon, and will giue ten tribes to thee.

32. But he shall haue one tribe for my seruant Dauids sake, and for Ierusalem the citie, which I haue chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,

33. Because they haue forsaken me, and haue worshipped Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and haue not walked in my wayes (to do right in mine eyes, & my statutes, & my lawes) as did Dauid his father.

34. But I will not take the whole kingdome out of his hande: for I will make him prince all his life long for Dauid my seruants sake, whome I haue chosen, and who kept my commandements and my statutes.

35. But I will take the kingdome out of his sonnes hand, and will giue it vnto thee, euen the ten tribes.

36. And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a

41. And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the 

42. The time that Salomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel, was fourtie yeere.

43. And Salomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the citie of Dauid his father: and Rehoboam his sonne reigned in his steade.

## 1 Kings 12

1. And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for al Israel were come to Sheche, to make him king

2. And whe Ieroboam ye sonne of Nebat heard of it (who was yet in Egypt, whither Ieroboam had fled from king Salomon, & dwelt in Egypt)

3. Then they sent and called him: and Ieroboam and all the Congregation of Israel came, and spake vnto Rehoboam, saying,

4. Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, 

5. And he said vnto them, Depart yet for three dayes, then come againe to me; the people departed.

6. And King Rehoboam tooke counsell with the olde men that had stande before Salomon his father, while he yet liued, and sayde, What counsell giue ye, that I may make an answere to this people?

11. Now where as my father did burden you with a grieuous yoke, I will yet make your yoke heauier: my father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges.

12. So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had 

13. And the king answered the people sharpely, and left the old mens counsell that they gaue him,

14. And spake to them after the counsell of the yong men, saying, My father made your yoke grieuous, and I will make your yoke more grieuous: my father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges.

15. And the King hearkened not vnto the people: for it was the ordinance of the Lorde, that he might perfourme his saying, which the Lorde had spoken by Ahiiah the Shilonite vnto Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat.

16. So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in 

17. Howbeit ouer the children of Israel, which dwelt in the cities of Iudah, did Rehoboam reigne still.

18. Nowe the King Rehoboam sent Adoram the receiuer of the tribute, and all Israel stoned him to death: then King Rehoboam made speede to get him vp to his charet, to flee to Ierusalem.

19. So Israel rebelled against the house 

20. And when all Israel had heard that Ieroboam was come againe, they sent and called him vnto the assemblie, and made him King ouer all Israel: none followed the house of Dauid, but the tribe of Iudah onely.

21. And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he 

22. But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the 

23. Speake vnto Rehoboam the sonne of Salomon King of Iudah, and vnto all the house of Iudah and Beniamin, and the remnant of the people, saying,

24. Thus saith the 

25. Then Ieroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein, and went fro thence, and built Penuel.

26. And Ieroboam thought in his heart, Nowe shall the kingdome returne to the house of Dauid.

27. If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD 

28. Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said unto them, 

29. And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other set he in Dan.

30. And this thing turned to sinne: for the people went (because of the one) euen to Dan.

31. And he made an 

32. And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the 

33. And he offered vpon the altar, which he had made in Beth-el, the fifteenth day of the eight moneth, (euen in the moneth which he had forged of his owne heart) and made a solemne feast vnto the children of Israel: and he went vp to the altar, to burne incense.

## 1 Kings 13

1. And, behold, there came 

2. And he cryed against the altar by the comandement of the Lorde, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord, Beholde, a child shalbe borne vnto the house of Dauid, Iosiah by name, and vpon thee shall he sacrifice the Priestes of the hie places that burne incense vpon thee, and they shall burne mens bones vpon thee.

3. And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This [is] the 

4. And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, 

5. The altar also claue asunder, and the ashes fell out from the altar, according to the signe, which the man of God had giuen by the commandement of the Lord.

6. And the king answered and said unto the man of God, 

7. Then the King sayde vnto the man of God, Come home with mee, that thou mayest dyne, and I will giue thee a reward.

8. But the man of God saide vnto the King, If thou wouldest giue me halfe thine house, I would not goe in with thee, neither woulde I eate bread nor drinke water in this place.

9. For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, 

10. So he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.

11. And an olde Prophet dwelt in Beth-el, and his sonnes came and tolde him all ye woorkes, that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el, and the wordes which he had spoken vnto the King, tolde they their father.

12. And their father sayde vnto them, What way went he? and his sonnes shewed him what waye the man of God went, which came from Iudah.

13. And hee saide vnto his sonnes, Saddle mee the asse. Who sadled him the asse, and hee rode thereon,

14. And went after the man of God, & found him sitting vnder an oke: and he saide vnto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Iudah? And he sayd, Yea.

15. Then he said unto him, 

16. But he answered, I may not returne with thee, nor go in with thee, neither wil I eate bread nor drinke water with thee in this place.

17. For it was charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor drinke water there, nor turne againe to goe by the way that thou wentest.

18. He said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as thou [art]; and an 

19. So he went againe with him, and did eate bread in his house, and dranke water.

20. And as they sate at the table, the worde of the Lorde came vnto the Prophet, that brought him againe.

21. And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, 

22. But camest backe againe, and hast eaten bread and drunke water in the place (whereof he did say vnto thee, Thou shalt eate no bread nor drinke any water) thy carkeis shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy fathers.

23. And when he had eaten bread & drunke, he sadled him the asse, to wit, to the Prophet whome he had brought againe.

24. And when he was gone, 

25. And beholde, men that passed by, sawe the carkeis cast in the way, and the lion standing by the corps: and they came and tolde it in ye towne where the olde Prophet dwelt.

26. And when the Prophet that brought him backe againe from the waye, hearde thereof, hee sayde, It is the man of God, who hath bene disobedient vnto the commandement of the Lorde: therefore the Lorde hath deliuered him vnto the lion, which hath rent him and slayne him, according to the worde of the Lorde, which hee spake vnto him.

27. And he spake to his sonnes, saying, Saddle me the asse; they sadled him.

28. And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had 

29. And the Prophet tooke vp the body of the man of God, & layed it vpon the asse, & brought it againe, and the olde Prophet came to the citie, to lament and burie him.

30. And he laid his carcase in his 

31. And when he had buried him, hee spake to his sonnes, saying, When I am dead, burie ye mee also in the sepulchre, wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside his bones.

32. For that thing which he cried by the word of the Lorde against the altar that is in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the hie places, which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to passe.

33. After this thing Jeroboam 

34. And this thing turned to sinne vnto the house of Ieroboam, euen to roote it out, and destroy it from the face of the earth.

## 1 Kings 14

1. At that time Abiiah the sonne of Ieroboam fell sicke.

2. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, 

3. And take with 

4. And Ieroboams wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahiiah: but Ahiiah could not see, for his sight was decayed for his age.

5. And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he [is] sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself [to be] 

6. And it was [so], when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou 

7. Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted 

8. And haue rent the kingdome away from the house of Dauid, and haue giuen it thee, and thou hast not bene as my seruant Dauid, which kept my commaundements, and followed mee with all his heart, and did onely that which was right in mine eyes,

9. But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and 

10. Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that 

11. Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: 

12. Vp therefore and get thee to thine house: for when thy feete enter into the citie, the childe shall die.

13. And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found 

14. Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: 

15. For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the 

16. And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who 

17. And Ieroboams wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah, and when shee came to the threshold of the house, the yong man dyed,

18. And they buried him, and all Israel lamented him; according to the word of the Lord, which hee spake by the hand of his seruant Ahiiah the Prophet.

19. And the rest of Ieroboams actes, how hee warred, and howe hee reigned, beholde, they are written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

20. And the days which Jeroboam reigned [were] two and twenty years: and he 

21. And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam [was] forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen 

22. And Iudah wrought wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde: and they prouoked him more with their sinnes, which they had committed, then all that which their fathers had done.

23. For they also made them hie places, and images, and groues on euery hie hill, and vnder euery greene tree.

24. And there were also sodomites in the 

25. And in the fift yere of King Rehoboam, Shishak King of Egypt came vp against Ierusale,

26. And tooke the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the Kings house, and tooke away all: also he caried away all the shields of golde which Salomon had made.

27. And King Rehoboam made for them brasen shieldes, and committed them vnto ye hands of the chiefe of the garde, which wayted at the doore of the Kings house.

28. And when the King went into the house of the Lorde, the garde bare them, and brought them againe into the gard chamber.

29. Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, [are] they not written in

31. And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name [was] Naamah an 

## 1 Kings 15

1. And in the eighteene yere of King Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, reigned Abiiam ouer Iudah.

2. Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of 

3. And hee walked in all the sinnes of his father, which hee had done before him: and his heart was not perfit with the Lord his God as the heart of Dauid his father.

4. Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a 

5. Because Dauid did that which was right in the sight of the Lorde, and turned from nothing that he commanded him, all the dayes of his life, saue onely in the matter of Vriah the Hittite.

6. And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam as long as he liued.

7. The rest also of the actes of Abiiam, and all that he did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah? There was also warre betweene Abiiam, and Ieroboam.

8. And Abiiam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the citie of Dauid: and Asa his sonne reigned in his steade.

9. And in the twentie yeere of Ieroboam King of Israel reigned Asa ouer Iudah.

10. And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his

12. And he tooke away the Sodomites out of the lande, and put away all the idoles that his fathers had made.

13. And also Maachah his mother, even her he 

14. But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was 

15. Also he brought in the holy vessels of his father, & the things that he had dedicated vnto ye house of the Lord, siluer, and golde, and vessels.

16. And there was warre betweene Asa and Baasha King of Israel all their dayes.

17. And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built 

18. Then Asa tooke all the siluer and the gold that was left in the treasures of the house of the Lord, & the treasures of the kings house, and deliuered them into the handes of his seruantes, and King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the sonne of Tabrimon, the sonne of Hezion king of Aram that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

19. [There is] a league between me and thee, [and] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may 

20. So Ben-hadad hearkened vnto King Asa, and sent the captaines of the hosts, which he had, against the cities of Israel, and smote lion, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, & all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.

21. And when Baasha heard thereof, hee left buylding of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

22. Then king Asa assembled al Iudah, none excepted; they tooke the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had buylt, & King Asa built with them Geba of Beniamin and Mizpah.

23. The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his

26. And he did euill in the sight of the Lorde, walking in the way of his father, and in his sinne wherewith he made Israel to sinne.

27. And Baasha the sonne of Ahijah of ye house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha slue him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistims: for Nadab and all Israel layde siege to Gibbethon.

28. Euen in the third yeere of Asa King of Iudah did Baasha slay him, & reigned in his steade.

29. And it came to pass, when he reigned, [that] he

32. And there was warre betweene Asa & Baasha King of Israel, all their dayes.

33. In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in 

34. And he did euill in the sight of the Lorde, walking in the way of Ieroboam, & in his sinne, wherewith he made Israel to sinne.

## 1 Kings 16

1. Then the word of the Lord came to Iehu the sonne of Hanani against Baasha, saying,

2. 
          

3. Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make

5. And the rest of the actes of Baasha & what he did, & his power, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

6. So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buryed in Tirzah, and Elah his sonne reigned in his steade.

7. And also 

8. In the sixe and twentie yeere of Asa king of Iudah began Elah ye sonne of Baasha to reigne ouer Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two yeere.

9. And his servant Zimri, captain of half [his] chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, 

10. And Zimri came and smote him & killed him, in the seuen and twentie yeere of Asa king of Iudah, and reigned in his stead.

11. And when he was King, and sate on his throne, he slew al the house of Baasha, not leauing thereof one to pisse against a wall, neither of his kinsfolkes nor of his friendes.

12. Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the 

13. For all the sinnes of Baasha, and sinnes of Elah his sonne, which they sinned & made Israel to sinne, and prouoked the Lorde God of Israel with their vanities.

14. And the rest of the actes of Elah, & all that he did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

15. In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people [were] encamped 

16. And the people of the hoste heard saye, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slayne the King. Wherefore all Israel made Omri the captaine of the hoste, king ouer Israel that same day, euen in the hoste.

17. And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged 

18. And when Zimri saw, that the citie was taken, he went into the palace of the Kings house, and burnt himselfe, and the Kings house with fire, and so dyed,

19. For his sinnes which hee sinned, in doing that which is euil in the sight of the Lord, in walking in the way of Ieroboam, and in his sinnes which he did, causing Israel to sinne.

20. And the rest of the actes of Zimri, and his treason that hee wrought, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kinges of Israel?

21. Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: 

22. But the people that folowed Omri, preuayled against the people that followed Tibni the sonne of Ginath: so Tibni dyed, & Omri reigned.

23. In the one and thirtie yeere of Asa King of Iudah bega Omri to reigne ouer Israel, & reigned twelue yeere. Sixe yeere reigned he in Tirzah.

24. And he bought the mountaine Samaria of one Shemer for two talents of siluer, & buylt in the mountaine, & called the name of the citie, which he buylt, after the name of Shemer lord of the mountaine, Samaria.

25. But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did 

26. For he walked in all the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, & in his sinnes wherewith he made Israel to sinne in prouoking the Lord God of Israel with their vanities.

27. And the rest of the actes of Omri, that hee did, and his strength that he shewed, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

28. So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in 

29. Nowe Ahab the sonne of Omri began to reigne ouer Israel, in the eyght & thirtie yeere of Asa king of Iudah: and Ahab the sonne of Omri reigned ouer Israel in Samaria two & twety yere.

30. And Ahab the sonne of Omri did worse in ye sight of the Lord then al that were before him.

31. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took 

32. Also he reared vp an altar to Baal in the house of Baal, which he had buylt in Samaria.

33. And Ahab made a groue, & Ahab proceeded, & did prouoke the Lord God of Israel more then all the kings of Israel that were before him.

34. In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build

3. Go hence, and turne thee Eastwarde, and hide thy selfe in the riuer Cherith, that is ouer against Iorden,

4. And it shall be, [that] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the 

5. So he went & did according vnto the word of the Lord: for he went, and remained by the riuer Cherith that is ouer against Iorden.

6. And the rauens brought him bread & flesh in the morning, and bread & flesh in the euening, and he dranke of the riuer.

7. And after a while the riuer dryed vp, because there fell no rayne vpon the earth.

8. And the 

9. Vp, & get thee to Zarephath, which is in Zidon, and remaine there: beholde, I haue commanded a widow there to sustaine thee.

10. So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman [was] there 

11. And as she was going to fet it, he called to her, and sayde, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsell of bread in thine hand.

12. And she said, [As] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and 

13. And Eliiah said vnto her, Feare not, come, do as thou hast sayd, but make me thereof a litle cake first of all, and bring it vnto mee, and afterward make for thee, and thy sonne.

14. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, 

15. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat 

16. The barrell of the meale wasted not, nor the oyle was spent out of the cruse, according to the worde of the Lorde, which he spake by the hand of Eliiah.

17. And it came to pass after these things, [that] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no 

18. And she said vnto Eliiah, What haue I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come vnto me to call my sinne to remembrance, and to slay my sonne?

19. And he said vnto her, Giue me thy sonne; he tooke him out of her bosome, and caryed him vp into a chamber, where he abode, and laid him vpon his owne bed.

20. And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also 

21. And he stretched himselfe vpon the childe three times, and called vnto the Lord, and saide, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this childes soule come into him againe.

22. Then the Lord heard the voyce of Eliiah, and the soule of the child came into him againe, and he reuiued.

23. And Eliiah tooke the childe, and brought him downe out of the chamber into the house, and deliuered him vnto his mother, and Eliiah sayd, Behold, thy sonne liueth.

24. And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this 

## 1 Kings 18

1. And it came to pass [after] many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the 

2. And Eliiah went to shew himselfe vnto Ahab, and there was a great famine in Samaria.

3. And Ahab called Obadiah, which [was] the governor of [his] house. (Now Obadiah 

4. For when Iezebel destroyed the Prophets of the Lorde, Obadiah tooke an hundreth Prophets, and hid them, by fiftie in a caue, and he fed them with bread and water.)

5. And Ahab saide vnto Obadiah, Goe into the land, vnto all the fountaines of water, and vnto all the riuers, if so be that we may finde grasse to saue the horses and the mules aliue, lest we depriue the lande of the beastes.

6. And so they deuided the lande betweene them to walke thorowe it. Ahab went one way by him selfe, and Obadiah went another way by him selfe.

7. And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah 

8. And he answered him, Yea, goe tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here.

9. And he said, What haue I sinned, that thou wouldest deliuer thy seruant into the hande of Ahab, to slay me?

10. As the Lorde thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdome, whither my lorde hath not sent to seeke thee: and when they sayd, He is not here, he tooke an othe of the kingdome and nation, if they had not found thee.

11. And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lorde, Beholde, Eliiah is here.

12. And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and [so] when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant 

13. Was it not tolde my lord, what I did when Iezebel slew the Prophets of the Lord, how I hid an hundreth men of the Lordes Prophets by fifties in a caue, and fed them with bread & water?

14. And now thou sayest, Go, tel thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here, that he may slay me.

15. And Elijah said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew 

16. So Obadiah went to meete Ahab, and tolde him: And Ahab went to meete Eliiah.

17. And when Ahab saw Eliiah, Ahab said vnto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

18. And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but 

19. Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel vnto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal foure hundreth and fiftie, and the prophets of the groues foure hundreth, which eate at Iezebels table.

20. So Ahab sent vnto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together vnto mount Carmel.

21. And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long 

22. Then said Eliiah vnto the people, I onely remayne a Prophet of the Lorde: but Baals prophets are foure hundreth and fiftie men.

23. Let them therefore giue vs two bullockes, and let them chuse the one, & cut him in pieces, and lay him on the wood, but put no fire vnder, and I will prepare the other bullocke, and lay him on the wood, and will put no fire vnder.

24. And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth 

25. And Eliiah said vnto the prophets of Baal, Chuse you a bullocke, and prepare him first, (for ye are many) and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire vnder.

26. And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it], and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. And they 

27. And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, [or] peradventure he sleepeth, and must be 

28. And they cryed loude, and cut them selues as their maner was, with kniues and launcers, till the blood gushed out vpon them.

29. And when midday was passed, & they had prophecied vntil the offring of the euening sacrifice, there was neither voyce, nor one to answere, nor any that regarded.

30. And Eliiah said vnto all the people, Come to me; all the people came to him; he repayred the altar of the Lorde that was broken downe.

31. And Eliiah tooke twelue stones, according to the nomber of the tribes of the sonnes of Iaakob, (vnto whome the worde of the Lord came, saying, Israel shalbe thy name)

32. And with the stones he buylt an altar in the Name of the Lorde: and he made a ditch round about the altar, as great as woulde conteine two measures of seede.

33. And he put the wood in order, and hewed the bullocke in pieces, & layd him on the wood,

14. Then they sent to Iezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned and is dead.

15. And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, 

16. And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he rose to go downe to the vineyard of Naboth the Izreelite, to take possession of it.
