7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: 

8. 
          

9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my 

10. Alwayes in my prayers, beseeching that by some meanes, one time or other I might haue a prosperous iourney by the will of God, to come vnto you.

11. For I long to see you, that I might bestowe among you some spirituall gift, that you might be strengthened:

12. That is, that 

13. Now my brethren, I would that ye should not be ignorant, how that I haue oftentimes purposed to come vnto you (but haue bene let hitherto) that I might haue some fruite also among you, as I haue among the other Gentiles.

14. I am detter both to the Grecians, and to the Barbarians, both to the wise men and vnto the vnwise.

15. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at

24. 
          

25. Which turned the trueth of God vnto a lie, and worshipped and serued the creature, forsaking the Creator, which is blessed for euer, Amen.

26. For this cause God gaue them vp vnto vile affections: for euen their women did change the naturall vse into that which is against nature.

27. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that 

28. 
          

29. Being full of all vnrighteousnesse, fornication, wickednes, couetousnes, maliciousnes, full of enuie, of murther, of debate, of deceit, taking all things in the euill part, whisperers,

30. Backbiters, haters of God, doers of wrong, proude, boasters, inuenters of euil things, disobedient to parents,

10. But to euery man that doeth good, shalbe glory, and honour, and peace: to the Iew first, and also to the Grecian.

11. For there is no

21. Thou therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not thy selfe? thou that preachest, A man should not steale, doest thou steale?

22. Thou that saist, A man should not commit adulterie, doest thou commit adulterie? thou that abhorrest idoles, committest thou sacrilege?

23. Thou that gloriest in the Lawe, through breaking the Lawe, dishonourest thou God?

24. For ye Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

9. 
          

10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.

11. There is none that vnderstandeth: there is none that seeketh God.

12. They haue all gone out of the way: they haue bene made altogether vnprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no not one.

13. Their throte is an open sepulchre: they haue vsed their tongues to deceit: the poyson of aspes is vnder their lippes.

8. Wherefore, if we bee dead with Christ, we beleeue that we shall liue also with him,

9. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more dominion ouer him.

10. For in that he died, he died unto sin 

11. Likewise thinke ye also, that ye are dead to sin, but are aliue to God in Iesus Christ our Lord.

12. 
          

13. Neither

17. 
          

18. Being then made free from sinne, yee are made the seruants of righteousnesse.

19. I speake after the maner of man, because of the infirmitie of your flesh: for as yee haue giuen your members seruants to vncleannes and to iniquitie, to commit iniquitie, so now giue your mebers seruants vnto righteousnesse in holinesse.

20. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were 

21. 
          

22. But now being freed from sinne, and made seruants vnto God, ye haue your fruit in holines, and the end, euerlasting life.

2. For the woman which is in subiection to a man, is bound by the Lawe to the man, while he liueth: but if the man bee dead, shee is deliuered from the lawe of the man.

9. 
          

10. But I died: and the same commandement which was ordeined vnto life, was found to be vnto me vnto death.

11. For sinne tooke occasion by the commandement, and deceiued me, and thereby slewe me.

17. Now then it is no more I that do it, but 

18.

20. Nowe if I do that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but the sinne that dwelleth in me.

21.

17.

25. But if we hope for that we see not, we doe with patience abide for it.

29. For those which hee knewe before, he also predestinate to bee made like to the image of his Sonne, that hee might be the first borne among many brethren.

30. Moreover whom he did 

31.

33. 
          

34. Who shall condemne? it is Christ which is dead, yea, or rather, which is risen againe, who is also at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for vs.

35. Who shall separate us from the love of 

36. As it is written, For thy sake are we killed all day long: we are counted as sheepe for the slaughter.

37. 
          

38. For I am perswaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

39. Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shalbe able to separate vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.

25. 
          

26. And it shalbe in the place where it was said vnto them, Ye are not my people, that there they shalbe called, The children of the liuing God.

27. 
          

28. For he will finish the work, and cut [it]

## Romans 10

1. Brethren, 

2. For I beare them record, that they haue the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge.

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, 

7. Or, Who shal descend into the deepe? (that is to bring Christ againe from the dead)

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. For with the heart man 

11. 
          

12. For there is no difference betweene the Iewe and the Grecian: for he that is Lorde ouer all, is rich vnto all, that call on him.

13. 
          

14. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? 

15. And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, Howe beautifull are the feete of them which bring glad tidings of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

16. 
          

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. But Esaias is very 

21. And vnto Israel hee sayth, All the day long haue I stretched foorth mine hand vnto a disobedient, and gainesaying people.

## Romans 11

1. I say then, 

2. 
          

3. Lord, they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine altars: and I am left alone, and they seeke my life?

4. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have 

5. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the

7. What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were 

8. 
          

9. And David saith, 

10. Let their eyes be darkened that they see not, and bowe downe their backe alwayes.

12. Now if the fall of them [be] the 

13. 
          

14. To trie if by any meanes I might prouoke them of my flesh to follow them, and might saue some of them.

15. For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], 

16. 
          

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. Thou wilt say then, The branches are broken off, that I might be graft in.

20. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but 

21. For if God spared not the

24. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by 

25. 
          

26. And so all Israel shalbe saued, as it is written, The deliuerer shall come out of Sion, and shall turne away the vngodlinesse from Iacob.

27. And this is my couenant to them, When I shall take away their sinnes.

28. 
          

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. Euen so nowe haue they not beleeued by the mercie shewed vnto you, that they also may obtaine mercie.

11. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; 

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Blesse them which persecute you: blesse, I say, and curse not.

15. Reioyce with them that reioyce, & weepe with them that weepe.

16. [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of 

17. Recompence to no man euill for euill: procure things honest in the sight of all men.

18. If it bee possible, as much as in you is, haue peace with all men.

19. Dearely beloued, auenge not your selues, but giue place vnto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine: I will repay, saith the Lord.

20. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap

8. For whether wee liue, we liue vnto the Lorde: or whether we die, we die vnto the Lorde: whether we liue therefore, or die, we are the Lords.

9. For Christ therefore died and rose againe, and reuiued, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the quicke.

10. 
          

11. For it is written, [As] I 

12. So then euery one of vs shall giue accounts of himselfe to God.
