## Revelation 1

1. The 

2. Who bare record of ye word of God, & of the testimonie of Iesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that heare the wordes of this prophecie, and keepe those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.

4. 
          

5. And from Jesus Christ, 

6. And made vs Kings and Priests vnto God euen his Father, to him I say be glory, and dominion for euermore, Amen.

7. Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every 

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. I was in the 

11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, that first and that last: & that which thou seest, write in a booke, and send it vnto the seuen Churches which are in Asia, vnto Ephesus, and vnto Smyrna, and vnto Pergamus, and vnto Thyatira, and vnto Sardis, and vnto Philadelphia, and vnto Laodicea.

12. 
          

13. And in the middes of the seuen candlestickes, one like vnto the Sonne of man, clothed with a garment downe to the feete, and girded about the pappes with a golden girdle.

14. His head, & heares were white as white wooll, and as snowe, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,

15. And his feete like vnto fine brasse, burning as in a fornace: and his voyce as the sounde of many waters.

16. And he had in his right hand seuen starres: and out of his mouth went a sharpe two edged sword: and his face shone as the sunne shineth in his strength.

17. 
          

18. And am aliue, but I was dead: and beholde, I am aliue for euermore, Amen: and I haue the keyes of hell and of death.

## Revelation 2

1. Unto 

2. 
          

3. And thou wast burdened, & hast patiece, and for my Names sake hast laboured, & hast not fainted.

4. Nevertheless I have [somewhat] 

5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and doe the first workes: or els I will come against thee shortly, & will remooue thy candlesticke out of his place, except thou amend.

6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the workes of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have 

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to 

15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the 

16. Repent thy selfe, or els I will come vnto thee shortly, and will fight against them with the sworde of my mouth.

17. 
          

18. And unto 

19. I know 

20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit 

21. And I gaue her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.

22. Beholde, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit fornication with her, into great affliction, except they repent them of their workes.

23. And I will kill her children with death: and all the Churches shall know that I am he which searche the reines and heartes: and I will giue vnto euery one of you according vnto your workes.

24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the 

25. But that which ye haue alreadie, hold fast till I come.

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. Euen as I receiued of my Father, so will I giue him the morning starre.

29. Let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirite saith to the Churches.

## Revelation 3

1. And unto the angel of the church in 

2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are 

3. Remember therefore, how thou hast receiued and heard, & hold fast & repent. If therefore thou wilt not watch, I will come on thee as a thiefe, and thou shalt not know what houre I wil come vpo thee.

4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis 

5. He that ouercommeth, shalbe clothed in white araye, and I will not put out his name out of the booke of life, but I will confesse his name before my Father, and before his Angels.

6. Let him that hath an eare, heare, what the Spirite saith vnto the Churches.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. Behold, I will make them 

10. Because thou hast 

11. Beholde, I come shortly: holde that which thou hast, that no man take thy crowne.

12. 
          

13. Let him that hath an eare, heare what ye Spirit saith vnto the Churches.

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. Therefore, because thou art Luke warme, and neither colde nor hote, it will come to passe, that I shall spewe thee out of my mouth.

17. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, 

18. I counsell thee to bye of me gold tried by the fire, that thou maiest bee made rich: and white raiment, that thou maiest be clothed, and that thy filthie nakednesse doe not appeare: and anoynt thine eyes with eye salue, that thou maiest see.

19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be 

20. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: 

21. 
          

22. Let him that hath an eare, heare what the Spirit saieth vnto the Churches.

1. After 

2. And

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calfe, & the thirde beast had a face as a man, & the fourth beast was like a flying Eagle.

8. And the 

9. And when those beasts 

10. 
          

11. 
          

## Revelation 5

1. And 

2. And I sawe a strong Angell which preached with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open ye booke, and to loose the seales thereof?

3. 
          

4. Then I wept much, because no man was foud worthy to open, and to reade the Booke, neither to looke thereon.

5. 
          

6. And I beheld, and, lo, 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. And they sung a 

10. And hast made vs vnto our God Kings and Priests, and we shall reigne on the earth.

11. 
          

12. Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to 

13. 
          

14. 
          

## Revelation 6

1. And 

2. And 

3. And 

4. And there went out an other horse, that was red, & power was giuen to him that sate thereon, to take peace fro the earth, & that they should kill one another, & there was giuen vnto him a great sword.

5. 
          

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A 

7. 
          

8. And I looked, and beholde, a pale horse, and his name that sate on him was Death, and Hell folowed after him, & power was giuen vnto them ouer the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sworde, and with hunger, and with death, and with beasts of the earth.

9. 
          

10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, Lord, which art holie and true! doest not thou iudge and auenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?

11. And 

12. 
          

13. And the starres of heauen fell vnto the earth, as a figge tree casteth her greene figges when it is shaken of a mightie winde.

14. And heauen departed away, as a scroule, when it is rolled, and euery mountaine and yle were mooued out of their places.

15. 
          

16. And said to the mountains and rocks, 

17. For the great day of his wrath is come, and who can stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And 

2. 
          

3. Hurt ye not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, til we haue sealed the seruants of our God in their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: [and there were] sealed 

5. Of the tribe of Iuda were sealed twelue thousande. Of the tribe of Ruben were sealed twelue thousande. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelue thousande.

6. Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelue thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthali were sealed twelue thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelue thousand.

7. Of the tribe of Simeon [were] sealed twelve thousand. 

8. Of the tribe of Zabulon [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of 

9. After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, 

10. 
          

11. And all the Angels stoode rounde about the throne, and about the Elders, and the foure beastes, and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,

12. Saying, Amen. Praise, and glorie, and wisdom, and thankes, and honour, and power, and might bee vnto our God for euermore, Amen.

13. 
          

14. And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, 

15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him 

16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sunne light on them, neither any heate.

17. For the Lambe, which is in the middes of the throne, shall gouerne them, and shall leade them vnto the liuely fountaines of waters, and God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. And 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. And the smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers of the saints, 

5. And the Angel tooke the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voyces, and thundrings, and lightnings, and earthquake.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. And the thirde part of the creatures, which were in the sea, and had life, died, and the thirde part of shippes were destroyed.

10. 
          

11. And the name of the star is called

## Revelation 9

1. 
          

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. And to them was comanded that they should not kil them, but that they should be vexed fiue moneths, & that their paine should be as the paine that commeth of a scorpion, when he hath stung a man.

6. Therefore in those dayes shall men seeke death, and shall not finde it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flie from them.

7. 
          

8. And they had heare as the heare of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lyons.

9. And they had habbergions, like to habbergions of yron: and the soud of their wings was like the sound of charets whe many horses runne vnto battel.

10. And they had tailes like vnto scorpions, and there were stings in their tailes, and their power was to hurt men fiue moneths.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, 

15. 
          

16. And the nomber of horsemen of warre were twentie thousand times ten thousand: for I heard the nomber of them.

17. And thus I saw the horses in a vision, & them that sate on them, hauing firie habbergions, and of Iacinth, and of brimstone, and the heads of the horses were as the heades of lyons: and out of their mouthes went foorth fire and smoke and brimstone.

18. Of these three was the thirde part of men killed, that is, of the fire, and of the smoke, and of the brimstone, which came out of their mouthes.

19. For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: 

20. 
          

21. Also they repented not of their murther, and of their sorcerie, neither of their fornication, nor of their theft.

## Revelation 10

1. And 

2. And he had in his hand a 

3. And cried with a loude voyce, as when a lyon roareth: and when he had cried, seuen thunders vttered their voyces.

4. 
          

5. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth 

6. And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, 

7. But in the days of the 

8. 
          

9. So I went vnto the Angel, and saide to him, Giue me the litle booke; he said vnto me, Take it, and eate it vp, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shalbe in thy mouth as sweete as honie.

10. Then I tooke the litle booke out of ye Angels hand, and ate it vp, and it was in my mouth as sweete as hony: but whe I had eaten it my belly was bitter.

11. 
          

## Revelation 11

1. And there 

2. 
          

3. And 

4. These 

5. 
          

6. These haue power to shut heauen, that it raine not in the dayes of their prophecying, and haue power ouer waters to turne them into blood, and to smite the earth with all maner plagues, as often as they will.

7. 
          

8. And their dead bodies [shall lie] in the 

9. And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies 

10. And they that dwell upon the earth 

11. 
          

12. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, 

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. Saying, We giue thee thankes, Lorde God almightie, Which art, and Which wast, and Which art to come: for thou hast receiued thy great might, and hast obteined thy kingdome.

18. 
          

19. And the temple of God was 

## Revelation 12

1. And 

2. And 

3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; 

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. And there was war in heaven: 

8. 
          

9. And the great dragon, that olde serpent, called the deuil and Satan, was cast out, which deceiueth all the world: he was euen cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, 

11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they 

12. Therefore reioyce, ye heauens, and ye that dwell in them. Wo to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the sea: for the deuill is come downe vnto you, which hath great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.

13. And when 

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. 
          

## Revelation 13

1. 
          

2. And the beast which I saw was like 

3. 
          

4. And they worshipped the dragon which gaue power vnto the beast, & they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like vnto the beast! Who is able to warre with him!

5. 
          

6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, 

7. And it was giuen vnto him to make warre with the Saints, and to ouercome them, & power was giuen him ouer euery kinred, and tongue, and nation.

8. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, 

9. 
          

10. If any leade into captiuitie, hee shall go into captiuitie: if any kill with a sword, he must be killed by a sword: here is the patience and the faith of the Saints.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an 

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. And that no man might 

18. 
          

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb 

2. And I heard a voyce from heauen, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder: and I heard the voyce of harpers harping with their harpes.

3. And they sung as it were a newe song before the throne, and before the foure beasts, and the Elders: and no man could learne that song, but the hundreth, fourtie and foure thousand, which were bought from the earth.

4. These are they, which are not defiled with women: for they are virgins: these followe the Lambe whithersoeuer he goeth: these are bought from men, being the first fruites vnto God, and to the Lambe.

5. And in their mouthes was found no guile: for they are without spot before the throne of God.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the 

9. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 

10. The same shall drinke of the wine of ye wrath of God, yea, of the pure wine, which is powred into the cup of his wrath, and he shalbe tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels, and before the Lambe.

11. And the smoke of their torment shall ascend euermore: and they shal haue no rest day nor night, which worship the beast and his image, and whosoeuer receiueth the print of his name.

12. 
          

13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die 

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. And he that sate on the cloude, thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17. 
          

18. And another Angel came out from the altar, which had power ouer fire, and cryed with a loude crie to him that had the sharpe sickle, & sayd, Thrust in thy sharpe sickle, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth: for her grapes are ripe.

19. And the Angel thrust in his sharpe sickle on the earth, and cut downe the vines of the vineyard of the earth, and cast them into that great wine presse of the wrath of God.

20. And the winepress was trodden without the city, 

## Revelation 15

1. And 

2. 
          

3. And they sing 

4. Who shall not feare thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name! for thou onely art holy, and all nations shall come and worship before thee: for thy iudgements are made manifest.

5. 
          

6. And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the

1. And 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. And I heard the Angel of the waters say, Lord, thou art iust, Which art, and Which wast: and Holy, because thou hast iudged these things.

6. For they shed the blood of the Saints, & Prophets, and therefore hast thou giuen them blood to drinke: for they are worthy.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. And men boyled in great heate, and blasphemed the Name of God, which hath power ouer these plagues, and they repented not, to giue him glorie.

10. 
          

11. And blasphemed the God of heauen for their paines, and for their sores, and repented not of their workes.

12. 
          

13. And I saw 

14. For they are the spirits of deuils, working miracles, to go vnto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battell of that great day of God Almightie.

## Revelation 18

1. And

3. For all nations haue drunken of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth haue committed fornication with her, and the marchants of the earth are waxed rich of the abundance of her pleasures.

4. 
          

5. For her sins have 

6. 
          

7. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith 

8. Therefore shall her plagues come in 

9. And 

10. And shall stand a farre off for feare of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great citie Babylon, that mightie citie: for in one houre is thy iudgemet come.

11. 
          

12. The ware of golde, and siluer, and of precious stone, and of pearles, and of fine linnen, and of purple, and of silke, and of skarlet, and of all maner of Thyne wood, and of all vessels of yuorie, and of all vessels of most precious wood, and of brasse, and of yron, and of marble,

13. And of cinamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oyle, and fine floure, and wheate, and beastes, and sheepe, and horses, and charets, and seruants, and soules of men.

14. 
          

15. The marchants of these thinges which were waxed riche, shall stand a farre off from her, for feare of her torment, weeping and wayling,

16. And saying, Alas, alas, that great citie, that was clothed in fine linnen and purple, and skarlet, and gilded with gold, and precious stones, and pearles.

17. 
          

18. And crie, when they see that smoke of that her burning, saying, What citie was like vnto this great citie?

19. And they shall cast dust on their heads, and crie, weeping, and wayling, and say, Alas, alas, that great citie, wherein were made rich all that had ships on the sea by her costlinesse: for in one houre she is made desolate.

20. Rejoice over her, 

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. And the light of a candle shall shine no more in thee: and the voyce of the bridegrome and of the bride shalbe heard no more in thee: for thy marchants were the great men of the earth: and with thine inchantments were deceiued all nations.

24. And in her was found the

1. And 

2. For true and righteous are his iudgements: for he hath condemned that great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath auenged the blood of his seruants shed by her hand.

3. And again they said, 

4. And the foure & twentie Elders, and the foure beastes fell downe, and worshipped God that sate on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelu-iah.
