## Judith 1

1. {\cf2 The booke of the woordes of Tobit sonne of Tobiel, the sonne of Ananeel, the sonne of Aduel, the sonne of Gabael, of the seede of Asael, and of the tribe of Nephthalim,}

2. {\cf2 Who in the time of Enemessar King of the Assyrians was led away captiue out of Thisbe, which is at the right hande of that citie, which is called properly Nephthalim, in Galilee aboue Aser.}

3. {\cf2 I Tobit haue walked all my life long in the way of trueth and iustice, and I did many things liberally to the brethren, which were of my nation, and came with me to Niniue into the lande of the Assyrians.}

4. {\cf2 And when I was in mine owne countrey in the lande of Israel, being but young, all the tribe of Nephthalim my father fell from the house of Ierusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes shoulde sacrifice there, where the Temple of the tabernacle of the most High was consecrated, and built vp for all ages.}

5. {\cf2 Nowe all the tribes which fell from God, yea, and my father Nephthalims house offered to the heifar called Baal.}

6. {\cf2 But I (as it was ordeined to all Israel by an euerlasting decree) went alone often to Ierusalem, at the feastes bringing the first fruites, and the tenth of beastes with that which was first shorne, and offred them at the altar to the Priests the children of Aaron.}

7. {\cf2 The first tenth part I gaue to the Priestes the sonnes of Aaron, which ministred in Ierusalem: the other tenth parte I solde, and came and bestowed it euery yeare at Ierusalem.}

8. {\cf2 The thirde tenth part I gaue vnto them to whome it was meete, as Debora my fathers mother had commaunded mee: for my father left mee as a pupill.}

9. {\cf2 Furthermore when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine owne kinred, and of her I begate Tobias.}

10. {\cf2 But when I was led captiue to Niniue, all my brethren, and those which were of my kinred, did eate of the bread of the Gentiles.}

11. {\cf2 But I kept my selfe from eating,}

12. {\cf2 Because I remebred God with al mine heart.}

13. {\cf2 Therefore the most High gaue me grace and fauour before Enemessar, so that I was his puruoier.}

14. {\cf2 And I went into Media, & I deliuered ten talents of siluer to Gabael the brother of Gabrias in the land of Media.}

15. {\cf2 But when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his sonne reigned in his stead: whose state because it was troubled, I coulde not goe into Media.}

16. {\cf2 But in the time of Enemessar, I gaue many almes to my brethren, and gaue my breade to them which were hungrie,}

17. {\cf2 And my clothes to the naked: and if I sawe any of my kinred dead, or cast about the walles of Niniue, I buried him.}

18. {\cf2 And if the King Sennacherib had slaine any, when he was come and fled from Iudea, I buried them priuilie (for in his wrath he killed many) but the bodies were not found when they were sought for of the king.}

19. {\cf2 Therefore when a certaine Nineuite had accused mee to the King, because I did burie them, I hid my selfe: and because I knewe that I was sought to be slaine, I withdrewe my selfe for feare.}

20. {\cf2 Then all my goods were spoyled, neither was there any thing left mee besides my wife Anna and my sonne Tobias.}

21. {\cf2 Neuerthelesse within fiue and fiftie dayes, two of his sonnes killed him, and they fled into the mountaines of Arrarath, and Sarchedonus his sonne reigned in his stead, who appointed ouer his fathers accomptes and ouer all his domesticall affaires Achiacharus my brother Anaels sonne.}

22. {\cf2 And when Achiacharus had made a request for me, I came againe to Niniue: nowe Achiacharus was cupbearer and keeper of the signet, and stewarde, and ouersawe the accompts: so Sarchedonus appoynted him next vnto him, and he was my brothers sonne.}

## Judith 2

1. {\cf2 Nowe when I was come home againe, and my wife Anna was restored vnto mee with my sonne Tobias, in the feast of Pentecoste, which is the holy feast of the seuen weekes, there was a great dinner prepared me, in ye which I sate downe to eat.}

2. {\cf2 And when I sawe abundance of meat, I sayde to my sonne, Go, and bring what poore man soeuer thou shalt finde of our brethren which doeth remember God, and loe I will tarie for thee.}

3. {\cf2 But hee came againe, and sayde, Father, one of our nation is strangled, and is cast out in the market place.}

4. {\cf2 Then before I had tasted any meate, I start vp, and brought him into mine house vntill the going downe of the sunne.}

5. {\cf2 Then I returned and washed, & ate my meate in heauinesse,}

6. {\cf2 Remembring that prophecie of Amos, which had saide, Your solemne feastes shall be turned into mourning, and your ioyes into wailing.}

7. {\cf2 Therefore I wept, and after the going downe of the sunne I went and made a graue and buried him.}

8. {\cf2 But my neighbours mocked mee, and sayde, Doeth he not feare, to die for this cause, who fled away, and yet, loe, he burieth the dead againe.}

9. {\cf2 The same night also when I returned from the buriall, and slept at the wall of mine house because I was polluted, & hauing my face vncouered,}

10. {\cf2 And I knewe not that sparrowes were in the wall, and as mine eyes were open, the sparrowes cast downe warme dongue into mine eyes, and a whitenesse came in mine eyes, and I went to the Phisitions, but they helped me not. Moreouer Achiacharus did nourish me, vntill I went into Helimais.}

11. {\cf2 And my wife Anna did take womens works to doe.}

12. {\cf2 And when shee had sent them home to the owners, they paied the wages, and gaue a kid.}

13. {\cf2 Which when it was at mine house, & beganto bleate, I sayd vnto her, from whence is this kid? Is it not stollen? Render it to the owners: for it is not lawfull to eate any thing that is stollen.}

14. {\cf2 But shee sayde, It was giuen for a gift more then the wages, but I did not beleeue, and bade her to render it to the owners, and I did blush, because of her. Furthermore she said, where are thine almes, and thy righteousnes? behold, they all nowe appeare in thee.}

## Judith 3

1. {\cf2 Then I, being sorowfull did weepe, and in my sorow prayed, saying,}

2. {\cf2 O Lord, thou art iust, and all thy workes, & all thy wayes are mercy and trueth, & thou iudgest truely and iustly for euer.}

3. {\cf2 Remember me, & looke on me, neither punish me according to my sinnes or mine ignorances or my fathers, which haue sinned before thee.}

4. {\cf2 For they haue not obeyed thy commaundementes: wherefore thou hast deliuered vs for a spoyle, & vnto captiuitie, & to death, & for a prouerbe of a reproch to all them among who we are dispersed, & now thou hast many and iust causes,}

5. {\cf2 To do with me according to my sinnes, and my fathers, because we haue not kept thy comandemets, neither haue walked in trueth before thee.}

6. {\cf2 Now therfore deale with me as seemeth best vnto thee, and commande my spirite to be taken from me, that I may be dissolued, & become earth: for it is better for me to dye then to liue, because I haue heard false reproches, and am very sorowfull: command therefore that I may be dissolued out of this distresse, & go into the euerlasting place: turne not thy face away from me.}

7. {\cf2 It came to passe the same day that in Ecbatane a citie of Media, Sarra the daughter of Raguel was also reproched by her fathers maydes,}

8. {\cf2 Because she had bene marryed to seuen husbands, whom Asmodeus the euill spirit had killed, before that they had lyen with her. Doest thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had now seuen husbands, neyther wast thou named after any of them.}

9. {\cf2 Wherfore doest thou beate vs for them? if they be dead, go thy wayes hence to them, that we may neuer see of thee either sonne or daughter.}

10. {\cf2 When she heard these things, shee was very sorowful, so that she thought to haue strangled her selfe; she sayde, I am the onely daughter of my father, and if I do this, I shal slaunder him, and shal bring his age to the graue with sorow.}

11. {\cf2 Then she prayed towarde the windowe, and sayd, Blessed art thou, O Lorde my God, and thine holy & glorious Name is blessed, & honorable for euer: let all thy workes prayse thee for euer.}

12. {\cf2 And nowe, O Lord, I set mine eyes, and my face toward thee,}

13. {\cf2 And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may heare no more any reproch.}

14. {\cf2 Thou knowest, O Lord, that I am pure from all sinne with man,}

15. {\cf2 And that I haue neuer polluted my name, nor the name of my father in ye land of my captiuitie: I am ye only daughter of my father, neither hath he any manchild to be his heire, neither any neere kinseman or childe borne of him, to whome I may keepe my selfe for a wife: my seue husbands are now dead, & why should I liue? But if it please not thee that I should die, command to looke on me, and to pitie me that I do no more heare reproch.}

16. {\cf2 So the prayers of them both were heard before the maiestie of the great God.}

17. {\cf2 And Raphael was sent to heale them both, that is, to take away the whitenes of Tobits eyes, & to giue Sarra the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the sonne of Tobit, and to binde Asmodeus the euill spirite, because she belonged to Tobias by right. The selfe same time came Tobit home, and entred into his house, and Sarra the daughter of Raguel came downe from her chamber.}

## Judith 4

1. {\cf2 In that day Tobit remembred the siluer, which hee had deliuered to Gabael in Rages a citie of Media,}

2. {\cf2 And sayde with himselfe, I haue wished for death: wherefore do I not call for my sonne Tobias that I may admonish him before I die?}

3. {\cf2 And whe he had called him, he said, My sone, after that I am dead, bury me, and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the dayes of thy life, and do that which shal please her, & anger her not.}

4. {\cf2 Remember, my sonne, howe many dangers she susteined when thou wast in her wombe,}

5. {\cf2 And when she dyeth, bury her by me in the same graue.}

6. {\cf2 My sonne, set our Lord God alwayes before thine eyes, and let not thy wil be set to sinne or to trasgresse the comandements of God. Do vprightly all thy life long, and followe not the wayes of vnrighteousnesse: for if thou deale truely, thy doings shal prosperously succeede to thee, and to all them which liue iustly.}

7. {\cf2 Giue almes of thy substance: & when thou giuest almes, let not thine eye be enuious, neyther turne thy face from any poore, lest that God turne his face from thee.}

8. {\cf2 Giue almes according to thy substace: if thou haue but a litle, be not afrayd to giue a litle almes.}

9. {\cf2 For thou layest vp a good store for thy selfe against the day of necessitie,}

10. {\cf2 Because that almes doeth deliuer fro death, and suffreth not to come into darkenesse.}

11. {\cf2 For almes is a good gifte before the most High to all them which vse it.}

12. {\cf2 Beware of all whoredome, my sonne, and chiefly take a wife of the seede of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy fathers stocke: for wee are the children of the Prophetes. Noe, Abraham, Isaac and Iacob are our fathers from the beginning. Remember my sonne, that they marryed wiues of their owne kinred, and were blessed in their children, and their seede shall inherite the lande.}

13. {\cf2 Now therefore, my sonne, loue thy brethren, & despise not in thine heart thy brethre, the sonnes and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction, & much trouble, and in fiercenes is scarcitie, and great pouertie: for fiercenes is the mother of famine.}

14. {\cf2 Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tary with thee, but giue him it out of hand: for if thou serue God, he wil also pay thee: be circumspect, my sonne, in all thinges that thou doest, & be wel instructed in all thy conuersation.}

15. {\cf2 Do that to no ma which thou hatest: drinke not wine to make thee drunken, neyther let drunkennesse go with thee in thy iourney.}

16. {\cf2 Giue of thy bread to the hungry, & of thy garments to them that are naked, and of all thine abundance giue almes, and let not thine eye be enuious, when thou giuest almes.}

17. {\cf2 Powre out thy bread on the buriall of the iust, but giue nothing to the wicked.}

18. {\cf2 Aske counsell alway of the wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.}

19. {\cf2 Blesse thy Lord God alway, & desire of him that thy wayes may be made streight, and that all thy purposes and counsels may prosper: for euery nation hath not counsell: but the Lord giueth all good things, and he humbleth whome he wil, as he will: now therefore, my sonne, remember my commandements, neyther let them at any time be put out of thy minde.}

20. {\cf2 Furthermore I signifie this to thee, that I deliuered tenne talents to Gabael the sonne of Gabrias at Rages in Media.}

21. {\cf2 And feare not, my sonne, forasmuch as wee are made poore: for thou hast many things, if thou feare God, & flee from all sinne, and do that thing which is acceptable vnto him.}

## Judith 5

1. {\cf2 Tobias then answered, and sayd, Father, I wil do all things which thou hast commanded me.}

2. {\cf2 But howe can I receiue the siluer, seeing I know him not?}

3. {\cf2 Then he gaue him the hand writing, & sayd vnto him, Seeke thee a man, which may goe with thee, whiles I yet liue, and I will giue him wages, & go and receiue the money.}

4. {\cf2 Therfore when he was gone to seeke a man, he found Raphael the Angel.}

5. {\cf2 But he knewe not, and sayd vnto him, May I goe with thee into the land of Media? and knowest thou those places well?}

6. {\cf2 To whom the Angel said, I wil go with thee: for I haue remained with our brother Gabael.}

7. {\cf2 Then Tobias sayd to him, Tarie for me, till I tell my father.}

8. {\cf2 Then he sayde vnto him, Goe, and tarie not: so he went in and sayde to his father, Beholde, I haue founde one, which will goe with me. Then he sayde, Call him vnto me, that I may knowe of what tribe he is, and whether he be faithfull to goe with thee.}

9. {\cf2 So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.}

10. {\cf2 Then Tobit sayde vnto him, Brother, shewe me of what tribe and familie thou art.}

11. {\cf2 To whom he said, Doest thou seeke a stocke or familie, or an hired man to goe with thy sonne? Then Tobit sayd vnto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and thy name.}

12. {\cf2 Then he sayd, I am of the kinred of Azarias and Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.}

13. {\cf2 Then Tobit sayde, Thou art welcome, brother: be not now angry with me, because I haue enquired to knowe thy kinred, & thy familie: for thou art my brother of an honest & good stocke: for I know Ananias & Ionathas, sonnes of that great Samaias: for we went together to Ierusalem to worship, & offred the first borne, & the tenthes of the fruites, & they were not deceiued with the error of our brethren my brother, thou art of a great stocke.}

14. {\cf2 But tel me, What wages shal I giue thee? wilt thou a groate a day and things necessarie, as to mine owne sonne?}

15. {\cf2 Yea, moreouer if ye returne safe, I will adde some thing to the wages.}

16. {\cf2 So they agreed. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thy selfe for the iourney, and goe you on Gods Name; when his sonne had prepared all things for the iourney, his father sayde, Goe thou with this man, and God which dwelleth in heauen, prosper your iourney, & the Angel of God keepe you companie. So they went forth both and departed, & the dogge of the yong man with them.}

17. {\cf2 But Anna his mother wept, & sayd to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our sonne? is he not the staffe of our hand to minister vnto vs?}

18. {\cf2 Woulde to God wee had not layde money vpon money, but that it had bene cast away in respect of our sonne.}

19. {\cf2 For that which God hath giuen vs to liue with, doeth suffice vs.}

20. {\cf2 Then said Tobit, Be not carefull, my sister: he shal returne in safetie, and thine eyes shal see him.}

21. {\cf2 For the good Angel doeth keepe him company, and his iourney shalbe prosperous, and he shal returne safe.}

22. {\cf2 Then she made an ende of weeping.}

## Judith 6

1. {\cf2 And as they went on their iourney, they came at night to the flood Tygris, and there abode.}

2. {\cf2 And when the yong man went to wash him selfe, a fish leaped out of the riuer, and would haue deuoured him.}

3. {\cf2 Then the Angel said vnto him, Take the fish; the yong man tooke ye fish, & drew it to land.}

4. {\cf2 To whome the Angel sayd, Cut the fish, and take the heart, and the liuer, and the gall, and put them vp surely.}

5. {\cf2 So the yong man did as the Angel commanded him: and when they had rosted the fishe, they ate it: then they both went on their way, till they came to Ecbatane.}

6. {\cf2 Then the yong man sayde to the Angel, Brother Azarias, what auaileth the heart, and the liuer, and the gall of the fish?}

7. {\cf2 And he sayd vnto him, Touching the heart, and the liuer, if a deuil or an euil spirit trouble any, we must make a perfume of this before the man or the woman, and he shalbe no more vexed.}

8. {\cf2 As for ye gall, anoynt a man that hath whitenes in his eyes, and he shalbe healed.}

9. {\cf2 And whe they were come neere to Rages,}

10. {\cf2 The Angel sayde to the yong man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin: he also hath one only daughter named Sarra: I will speake for her that she may be giue thee for a wife.}

11. {\cf2 For to thee doeth the right of her perteine, seeing thou alone art the remnant of her kinred,}

12. {\cf2 And the mayde is faire and wise: nowe therefore heare me, & I wil speake to her father, that we may make the mariage when we are returned from Rages: for I know that Raguel can not marry her to another according to the lawe of Moyses: els he should deserue death, because the right doth rather apperteine to thee then to any other man.}

13. {\cf2 Then the yong man answered the Angel, I haue heard, brother Azarias, that this mayde hath bene giuen to seuen men, who all dyed in the marriage chamber;}

14. {\cf2 And I am the only begotten sonne of my father, and I am afraid, least I go in to her, and dye as the other before: for a wicked spirite loueth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come in to her: wherefore I also feare least I die, and bring my fathers and my mothers life because of mee to the graue with sorowe: for they haue no other sonne to bury them.}

15. {\cf2 Then the Angel sayde vnto him, Doest thou not remember the preceptes which thy father gaue thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine owne kinred? wherefore heare me, O my brother: for she shall be thy wife, neither be thou carefull of the euill spirit: for this same night shall she be giuen thee in marriage.}

16. {\cf2 And when thou shalt goe into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take of the hote coles for perfumes, and make a perfume of the heart, and of the liuer of the fish,}

17. {\cf2 Which if the spirit do smel, he wil flee away, and nether come againe any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise vp both of you, and pray to God which is mercifull, who wil haue pitie on you, and saue you: feare not, for she is appoynted vnto thee from the beginning, and thou shalt keepe her, and she shall go with thee: moreouer I suppose that she shall beare thee children: nowe when Tobias had heard these things, he loued her, and his heart was effectually ioyned to her.}

## Judith 7

1. {\cf2 And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel: and Sarra met them, and after they had saluted one another, shee brought them into the house.}

2. {\cf2 Then sayde Raguel to Edna his wife, Howe like is this yong man to Tobit my cousin!}

3. {\cf2 And Raguel asked, Whence are you, my brethren? To whome they sayd, that they were of the tribe of Nephthalim, and of the captiues that dwelt at Nineue.}

4. {\cf2 Then he sayde to them, Doe ye knowe Tobit our kinsman? And they sayd, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?}

5. {\cf2 And they sayde, Hee is both aliue, and in good health: and Tobias sayd, He is my father.}

6. {\cf2 Then Raguel leaped, and kissed him, & wept,}

7. {\cf2 And blessed him, and sayde vnto him, Thou art the sonne of an honest and good man: but when he had heard that Tobit was blinde, he was sorowfull and wept.}

8. {\cf2 And likewise Edna his wife, and Sarra his daughter wept. Moreouer they receiued them with a ready minde, and after that they had killed a ram of the flocke, they set much meat on the table. The sayd Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, put forth those things whereof thou spakest in the way, that this businesse may be dispatched.}

9. {\cf2 So he communicated the matter with Raguel, and Raguel sayde to Tobias, Eate, and drinke, and make merry.}

10. {\cf2 For it is meete that thou shouldest marrie my daughter: neuerthelesse, I will declare vnto thee the trueth.}

11. {\cf2 I haue giuen my daughter in marriage to seuen men, who dyed that night which they came in vnto her: neuerthelesse, be thou of a good courage and merry. But Tobias sayde, I will eate nothing here, vntill yee bring her hither, and betrothe her to me.}

12. {\cf2 Raguel sayd then, Marry her then according to the custome: for thou art her cousin, and shee is thine. God which is mercifull, make this prosperous to you in all good things.}

13. {\cf2 Then hee called his daughter Sarra, and shee came to her father, and he tooke her by the hande, and gaue her for wife to Tobias, saying, Beholde, take her after the lawe of Moyses, and leade her away to thy father: and he blessed them,}

14. {\cf2 And called his wife Edna, and hee tooke a booke and wrote a contract, and sealed it.}

15. {\cf2 Then they began to eate.}

16. {\cf2 After, Raguel called his wife Edna, and sayde vnto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.}

17. {\cf2 Which when she had done, as he had bidden her, shee brought her thither: then Sarra wept, and her mother wiped away her daughters teares,}

18. {\cf2 And sayde vnto her, Be of good comfort, my daughter: the Lorde of heauen and earth giue thee ioy for this thy sorowe: bee of good comfort my daughter.}

## Judith 8

1. {\cf2 And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in vnto her.}

2. {\cf2 And as he went, he remembred the wordes of Raphael, and tooke coles for perfumes, and put the heart and liuer of the fish thereupon, and made a perfume.}

3. {\cf2 The which smell when the euill spirit had smelled, he fled into the vtmost partes of Egypt, whom the Angel bound.}

4. {\cf2 And after that they were both shut in, Tobias rose out of the bed, and sayd, Sister, arise and let vs pray, that God would haue pitie on vs.}

5. {\cf2 Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thine holy and glorious Name for euer: let the heauens blesse thee, and all thy creatures.}

6. {\cf2 Thou madest Adam, and gauest him Eua his wife for an helpe, and stay: of them came mankinde: thou hast sayde, It is not good, that a man should be alone: let vs make vnto him an ayde like vnto himselfe.}

7. {\cf2 And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for fornication, but vprightly: therfore graunt me mercie, that we may become aged together.}

8. {\cf2 And she sayd with him, Amen.}

9. {\cf2 So they slept both that night, and Raguel arose, and went and made a graue,}

10. {\cf2 Saying, Is not he dead also?}

11. {\cf2 But when Raguel was come into his house,}

12. {\cf2 He sayde to his wife Edna, Sende one of the maides, and let them see whether he be aliue: if not, that I may bury him, and none knowe it.}

13. {\cf2 So the maide opened the doore, and went in, and found them both asleepe,}

14. {\cf2 And came forth, & told them that he was aliue.}

15. {\cf2 Then Raguel praysed God, and sayd, O God, thou art worthy to be praysed with al pure, and holy prayse: therefore let thy Saintes prayse thee with all thy creatures, and let all thine Angels and thine elect prayse thee for euer.}

16. {\cf2 Thou art to be praised, O Lord: for thou hast made me ioyfull, and that is not come to me which I suspected: but thou hast dealt with vs according to great mercie.}

17. {\cf2 Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were ye onely begotten children of their fathers: graunt them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with ioy and mercy.}

18. {\cf2 Then Raguel bade his seruants to fil ye graue.}

19. {\cf2 And hee kept the wedding feast foureteene dayes.}

20. {\cf2 For Raguel had sayde vnto him by an othe, that he shoulde not depart before that the foureteene dayes of the marriage were expired,}

21. {\cf2 And then hee shoulde take the halfe of his goods and returne in safety to his father, & shoulde haue the rest, when he and his wife were dead.}

## Judith 9

1. {\cf2 Then Tobias called Raphael, and sayde vnto him,}

2. {\cf2 Brother Azarias, take with thee a seruant and two camels, and goe to Rages of the Medes to Gabael, and bring mee the money and bring him to the wedding.}

3. {\cf2 For Raguel hath sworne that I shall not depart.}

4. {\cf2 But my father counteth the dayes: and if I tarie long, he will be very sory.}

5. {\cf2 So Raphael went out & came to Gabael, and gaue him the hande writing, who brought forth bagges which were sealed vp, and gaue the to him.}

6. {\cf2 And in the morning they went forth, both together, and came to the wedding; Tobias begate his wife with childe.}

## Judith 10

1. {\cf2 Nowe Tobit his father counted euery day, and when the dayes of the iourney were expired, and they came not,}

2. {\cf2 Tobit sayde, Are they not mocked? or is not Gabael dead, and there is no man to giue him the money?}

3. {\cf2 Therefore he was very sory.}

4. {\cf2 Then his wife sayd to him, My sonne is dead, seeing he tarieth: and she began to bewayle him, and sayde,}

5. {\cf2 Nowe I care for nothing, my sonne, since I haue lost thee the light of mine eyes.}

6. {\cf2 To whom Tobit sayd, Holde thy peace: be not carefull, for he is safe.}

7. {\cf2 But she sayd, Holde thy peace, and deceiue me not: my sonne is dead: and she went out euery day by the way, which they went, neither did shee eate meate on the day time, and did consume whole nightes in bewayling her sonne Tobias vntill the foureteene dayes of ye wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworne, that he should tary there. Then Tobias sayde to Raguel, Let mee goe: for my father and my mother looke no more to see me.}

8. {\cf2 But his father in lawe sayde vnto him, Tarie with mee, and I will sende to thy father, and they shall declare him thine affaires.}

9. {\cf2 But Tobias sayde, No, but let mee goe to my father.}

10. {\cf2 Then Raguel arose, and gaue him Sarra his wife, and halfe his goods, as seruants, and cattel, and money,}

11. {\cf2 And hee blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heauen make you, my children, to prosper before I dye.}

12. {\cf2 And he sayd to his daughter, Honour thy father, and thy mother in lawe which are nowe thy parents, that I may heare good report of thee: and hee kissed them, Edna also sayde to Tobias, The Lord of heauen restore thee, my deare brother, and graunt that I may see thy children of my daughter Sarra, that I may reioyce before the Lord. Beholde nowe, I commit to thee my daughter, as a pledge doe not entreat her euill.}

## Judith 11

1. {\cf2 After these thinges Tobias went his way, praysing God that hee had giuen him a prosperous iourney, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till he drewe neere to Nineue.}

2. {\cf2 Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, howe thou diddest leaue thy father.}

3. {\cf2 Let vs haste before thy wife, and prepare the house,}

4. {\cf2 And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog followed them.}

5. {\cf2 Nowe Anna sate in the way looking for her sonne,}

6. {\cf2 Whom when she sawe comming, she sayd to his father, Behold, thy sonne cometh, and the man that went with him.}

7. {\cf2 Then sayd Raphael, I knowe, Tobias, that thy father shall receiue his sight.}

8. {\cf2 Therefore anoynt his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub and make the whitenesse to fall away, and shall see thee.}

9. {\cf2 Then Anna ranne foorth, and fell on the necke of her sonne, and sayde vnto him, Seeing I haue seene thee, my sonne, from henceforth I am content to die, and they wept both.}

10. {\cf2 Tobit also went forth toward the doore, and stumbled, but his sonne ranne vnto him.}

11. {\cf2 And tooke hold of his father and sprinkled of the gall on his fathers eyes, saying, Bee of good hope, my father.}

12. {\cf2 And when his eyes began to pricke, he rubbed them.}

13. {\cf2 And the whitenes pilled away from the corners of his eyes, and when he sawe his sonne, he fell vpon his necke,}

14. {\cf2 And hee wept and sayde, Blessed art thou, O Lorde, and blessed be thy Name for euer, and blessed be all thine holy Angels.}

15. {\cf2 For thou hast scourged me, and hast had pitie on me: for beholde, I see my sonne Tobias: and his sonne, being glad went in, and tolde his father the great things that had come to passe in Media.}

16. {\cf2 Then Tobit went out to meete his daughter in lawe, reioycing and praysing God to the gate of Nineue and they which saw him go, marueiled, because he had receiued his sight.}

17. {\cf2 But Tobit testified before the al, that God had had pitie on him; when he came neere to Sarra his daughter in lawe, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee vnto vs, and blessed be thy father: and there was great ioy among all his brethren which were at Nineue.}

18. {\cf2 And Achiacharus and Nasbas his brothers sonne came.}

19. {\cf2 And Tobias marriage was kept seuen dayes with great ioy.}

## Judith 12

1. {\cf2 Then Tobit called his sonne Tobias, and sayde vnto him, Prouide, my sonne, wages for ye man, which went with thee, & thou must giue him more.}

2. {\cf2 And he sayd vnto him, O father, it shall not grieue me to giue him halfe of those things which I haue brought.}

3. {\cf2 For he hath brought mee againe to thee in safetie, and hath made whole my wife, and hath brought me ye money, & hath likewise healed thee.}

4. {\cf2 Then the olde man sayd, It is due vnto him.}

5. {\cf2 So he called the Angel, and sayde vnto him, Take halfe of all that ye haue brought, and goe away in safetie.}

6. {\cf2 But he tooke them both apart, and said vnto them, Prayse God, and confesse him, and giue him the glory, and prayse him for the things which he hath done vnto you before all them that liue. It is good to praise God, and to exalt his Name, and to shewe forth his euident workes with honour: therefore be not weary to confesse him.}

7. {\cf2 It is good to keepe close the secrets of a King, but it is honorable to reueile the works of God: do that which is good, and no euil shal touch you.}

8. {\cf2 Prayer is good with fasting, and almes, and righteousnesse. A litle with righteousnesse is better then much with vnrighteousnes: it is better to giue almes then to lay vp golde.}

9. {\cf2 For almes doth deliuer from death, & doeth purge all sinne. Those which exercise almes & righteousnes, shalbe filled with life.}

10. {\cf2 But they that sinne, are enemies to their owne life.}

11. {\cf2 Surely I will keepe close nothing from you: neuertheles, I said it was good to keepe close the secret of a King, but that it was honorable to reueile the workes of God.}

12. {\cf2 Nowe therefore when thou diddest pray, and Sarra thy daughter in lawe, I did bring to memorie your prayer before the Holy one: and when thou diddest bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.}

13. {\cf2 And when thou wast not griued to rise vp, and leaue thy dinner to bury the dead, thy good deede was not hid from me: but I was with thee.}

14. {\cf2 And nowe God hath sent me to heale thee, and Sarra thy daughter in lawe.}

15. {\cf2 I am Raphael one of the seuen holy Angels, which present the prayers of the Saincts, and which go forth before his holy maiestie.}

16. {\cf2 Then they were both troubled, and fel vpon their face: for they feared.}

17. {\cf2 But he said vnto them, Feare not, for it shall go well with you: prayse God therefore.}

18. {\cf2 For I came not of mine owne pleasure, but by the good wil of your God: wherefore praise him in all ages.}

19. {\cf2 Al these dayes I did appeare vnto you, but I did neither eate nor drinke, but you saw it in visio.}

20. {\cf2 Now therefore giue God thanks: for I go vp to him that sent me: but write all things which are done, in a booke.}

21. {\cf2 And when they rose, they saw him no more.}

22. {\cf2 Then they confessed the great and wonderfull works of God, and how the Angel of the Lord had appeared to them.}

## Judith 13

1. {\cf2 Then Tobit wrote a prayer of reioycing, and sayd, Blessed be God that liueth for euer, and blessed be his kingdome.}

2. {\cf2 For he doeth scourge, and hath pitie: he leadeth to hell, and bringeth vp, neither is there any that can auoyde his hand.}

3. {\cf2 Cofesse him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered you among them.}

4. {\cf2 There declare his greatnesse, and extoll him before all the liuing: for he is our Lord & our God and our Father for euer.}

5. {\cf2 He hath scourged vs for our iniquities, and will haue mercie againe, and wil gather vs out of all nations, among whome we are scattered.}

6. {\cf2 If you turne to him with your whole heart, and with your whole minde, & deale vprightly before him, then will he turne vnto you, and will not hide his face from you, but ye shal see what he will doe with you: therefore confesse him with your whole mouth, & praise the Lord of righteousnes, & extoll the euerlasting King. I wil cofesse him in the land of my captiuitie, and will declare his power, & greatnes to a sinfull nation. O ye sinners, turne and do iustice before him: who can tell if he wil receiue you to mercy, and haue pitie on you?}

7. {\cf2 I will extoll my God, and my soule shall prayse the King of heauen, and shall reioyce in his greatnesse.}

8. {\cf2 Let all men speake, and let all praise him for his righteousnes.}

9. {\cf2 O Ierusalem the holy citie, he will scourge thee for thy childrens works, but he will haue pitie againe on the sonnes of righteous men.}

10. {\cf2 Giue prayse to the Lord duely, and praise the euerlasting King, that his tabernacle may be buylded in thee againe with ioy: and let him make ioyfull there in thee those that are captiues, and loue in thee for euer those that be miserable.}

11. {\cf2 Many nations shall come from farre to the Name of the Lord God, with gifts in their handes, euen giftes to the King of heauen: all generations shal praise thee, and giue signes of ioy.}

12. {\cf2 Cursed are al they, which haue thee: but blessed are they for euer which loue thee.}

13. {\cf2 Reioyce, and be glad for the children of the iust: for they shalbe gathered, and shall blesse the Lord of the iust.}

14. {\cf2 Blessed are they which loue thee: for they shall reioyce in thy peace. Blessed are they which haue bene sorowfull for all thy scourges: for they shal reioyce for thee, when they shal see all thy glorie, and shal reioyce for euer.}

15. {\cf2 Let my soule blesse God the great King.}

16. {\cf2 For Ierusalem shalbe built vp with sapphires, & emeraudes, and thy walles with precious stones, and thy towers, & thy bulwarkes with pure golde.}

17. {\cf2 And the streetes of Ierusalem shall be paued with berall, & carbuncle, and stones of Ophir.}

18. {\cf2 And all her streetes shal say, Halleluiah, and they shall prayse him, saying, Blessed be God which hath extolled it for euer.}

## Judith 14

1. {\cf2 So Tobit made an ende of praysing God.}

2. {\cf2 And he was eight & fiftie yeere olde, when hee lost his sight, which was restored to him after eyght yeere, and he gaue almes, and he continued to feare the Lord God, and to prayse him.}

3. {\cf2 And when he was very aged, hee called his sonne, & sixe of his sonnes sonnes, & sayde to him, My sonne, take thy children (for behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life)}

4. {\cf2 Go into Media, my sonne for I surely beleeue those things which Ionas the Prophet spake of Nineue, that it shalbe destroyed, & for a time peace shal rather be in Media, & that our brethren shalbe scattered in the earth from that good land, & Ierusalem shall be desolate, and the House of God in it shalbe burned, and shalbe desolate for a time.}

5. {\cf2 Yet againe God wil haue pitie on them, & bring them againe into the lande where they shall builde a Temple, but not like to the first, vntil the times of that age be fulfilled, which being finished, they shall returne from euery place out of captiuitie, & buylde vp Ierusalem gloriously, & the House of God shall be buylt in it for euer with a glorious buylding, as the Prophets haue spoken thereof.}

6. {\cf2 And all nations shal turne, & feare the Lord God truely, and shal burie their idoles.}

7. {\cf2 So shal all nations prayse the Lorde, and his people shall confesse God, and the Lorde shal exalt his people, and all those which loue the Lorde in trueth and iustice, shal reioyce, and those also which shew mercy to our brethren.}

8. {\cf2 And nowe, my sonne, depart out of Nineue, because that those things which the Prophet Ionas spake, shal surely come to passe.}

9. {\cf2 But keepe thou the Lawe, and the commandements, and shewe thy selfe merciful and iust that it may goe well with thee.}

10. {\cf2 And bury me honestly, & thy mother with me: but tary no longer at Nineue. Remember, my sonne, how Aman hadled Achiacharus that brought him vp, howe out of light hee brought him into darkenes, & how he rewarded him againe yet Achi acharus was saued, but the other had his reward: for he went downe into darknes. Manasses gaue almes, and escaped the snare of death, which they had set for him, but Aman fell into the snare and perished.}

11. {\cf2 Wherefore nowe, my sonne, consider what almes doeth, and howe righteousnes doeth deliuer. When he had sayde these things, he gaue vp the ghost in the bed, being an hundreth and eyght and fiftie yeere olde, and he buried him honourably.}

12. {\cf2 And when Anna was dead, hee buryed her with his father: but Tobias went with his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in lawe.}

13. {\cf2 Where he became olde with honour, and he buryed his father and mother in law honorably, & he inherited their substance and Tobits his father.}

14. {\cf2 And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundreth and seuen and twentie yeere olde.}

15. {\cf2 But before he dyed, he heard of the destruction of Nineue, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus, and before his death he reioyced for Nineue.}
