13. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. For the Lawe was giuen by Moses, but grace, and trueth came by Iesus Christ.

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. And he 

21. And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, 

22. Then said they vnto him, Who art thou, that we may giue an answere to them that sent vs? What sayest thou of thy selfe?

23. He said, I am the voyce of him that cryeth in the wildernesse, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Esaias.

24. 
          

25. And they asked him, and said unto him, 

26. John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one 

27. He it is that commeth after me, which was before me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthie to vnloose.

28. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordan, where Iohn did baptize.

29. 
          

30. This is he of whom I saide, After me commeth a man, which was before me: for he was better then I.

31. And 

32. 
          

33. And I knewe him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, he saide vnto me, Vpon whom thou shalt see that Spirit come downe, and tary still on him, that is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost.

34. And I saw, and bare record that this is 

35. 
          

36. 
          

37. 
          

38. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) 

39. He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the 

40. Andrewe, Simon Peters brother, was one of the two which had heard it of Iohn, and that followed him.

41. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the 

42. And he brought him to Iesus; Iesus behelde him, and saide, Thou art Simon the sonne of Iona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone.

43. The day following, Iesus woulde goe into Galile, and founde Philip, and said vnto him, Followe me.

44. Nowe Philip was of Bethsaida, the citie of Andrewe and Peter.

45. 
          

46. 
          

47. 
          

48. 
          

49. Nathanael answered, and saide vnto him, Rabbi, thou art that Sonne of God: thou art that King of Israel.

50. Iesus answered, and sayde vnto him, Because I sayde vnto thee, I sawe thee vnder the figtree, beleeuest thou? thou shalt see greater things then these.

51. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God

1. And 

2. And Iesus was called also, and his disciples vnto the mariage.

3. 
          

4. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine 

5. His mother saide vnto the seruants, Whatsoeuer he sayeth vnto you, doe it.

6. And there were set there six 

7. And Iesus sayde vnto them, Fill the waterpots with water. Then they filled them vp to the brim.

8. Then he sayde vnto them, Draw out nowe and beare vnto the gouernour of the feast. So they bare it.

9. Nowe when the gouernour of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, (for he knewe not whence it was: but the seruants, which drewe the water, knewe) the gouernour of ye feast called the bridegrome,

10. And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have 

11. This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana a towne of Galile, and shewed forth his glorie: and his disciples beleeued on him.

12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his 

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. Then hee made a scourge of small cordes, and draue them all out of the Temple with the sheepe and oxen, and powred out the changers money, and ouerthrewe the tables,

16. And said vnto them that solde doues, Take these things hence: make not my fathers house, an house of marchandise.

17. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The 

18. 
          

19. Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Destroy this Temple, and in three daies I will raise it vp againe.

20. Then said the Iewes, Fourtie & sixe yeeres was this Temple a building, and wilt thou reare it vp in three daies?

21. But he spake of the 

22. Assoone therefore as he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembred that hee thus sayde vnto them: and they beleeued the Scripture, and the worde which Iesus had saide.

23. Nowe when hee was at Hierusalem at the Passeouer in the feast, many beleeued in his Name, when they sawe his miracles which he did.

24. 
          

25. 
          

## John 3

1. There 

2. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a

4. Nicodemus saith unto him, How 

5. Iesus answered, Verely, verely I say vnto thee, except that a man be borne of water and of the Spirite, hee can not enter into the kingdome of God.

6. That which is born of the flesh is 

7. Marueile not that I said to thee, Yee must be borne againe.

8. The wind bloweth where it 

9. 
          

10. Iesus answered, & saide vnto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?

11. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our 

12. If when I tel you earthly things, ye beleeue not, howe should yee beleeue, if I shall tel you of heauenly things?

13. And no 

14. And as Moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse, so must that Sonne of man be lift vp,

15. That whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not perish, but haue eternall life.

16. 
          

17. 
          

18. Hee that beleeueth in him, is not condemned: but hee that beleeueth not, is condemned already, because he hath not beleeued in the Name of that onely begotten Sonne of God.

19. 
          

20. For euery man that euill doeth, hateth the light, neither commeth to light, least his deedes should be reprooued.

21. But he that 

22. After these things, came Iesus & his disciples into the lande of Iudea, and there taried with them, and baptized.

23. And Iohn also baptized in Enon besides Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

24. For Iohn was not yet cast into prison.

25. 
          

26. And they came vnto Iohn, and saide vnto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Iorden, to whom thou barest witnesse, behold, he baptizeth, and all men come to him.

27. John answered and said, A man 

28. Yee your selues are my witnesses, that I sayde, I am not that Christ, but that I am sent before him.

29. He that hath the bride, is the bridegrome: but the friend of the bridegrome which standeth and heareth him, reioyceth greatly, because of the bridegromes voyce. This my ioy therefore is fulfilled.

30. He must increase, but I must decrease.

31. He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is 

32. And what he hath 

33. He that hath receiued his testimonie, hath sealed that God is true.

34. For hee whome God hath sent, speaketh the woordes of God: for God giueth him not the Spirit by measure.

35. The Father loveth the Son, and hath

## John 4

1. When 

2. (Though Iesus himselfe baptized not: but his disciples)

3. Hee left Iudea, and departed againe into Galile.

4. And he must needes goe through Samaria.

5. 
          

6. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat 

7. There came a woman of Samaria to drawe water. Iesus sayd vnto her, Giue me drinke.

8. For his disciples were gone away into the citie, to buy meate.

9. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews 

10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest 

11. The woman saide vnto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to drawe with, and the well is deepe: from whence then hast thou that water of life?

12. Art thou greater then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the well, and hee himselfe dranke thereof, and his sonnes, and his cattell?

13. Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Whosoeuer drinketh of this water, shall thirst againe:

14. But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shall giue him, shall neuer be more a thirst: but the water that I shall giue him, shalbe in him a well of water, springing vp into euerlasting life.

15. The woman said vnto him, Syr, giue me of that water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to drawe.

16. Iesus said vnto her, Go, call thine husband, and come hither.

17. The woman answered, and saide, I haue no husband. Iesus said vnto her, Thou hast well said, I haue no husband.

18. For thou hast had fiue husbands, and he whom thou nowe hast, is not thine husband: that saidest thou truely.

19. The woman saide vnto him, Sir, I see that thou art a Prophet.

20. 
          

21. Iesus saide vnto her, Woman, beleeue me, the houre commeth, when ye shall neither in this mountaine, nor at Hierusalem worship ye Father.

22. Ye worship that which ye knowe not: we worship that which we knowe: for saluation is of the Iewes.

23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in 

24. God [is] a 

25. The woman said vnto him, I knowe well that Messias shall come which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell vs all things.

26. Iesus said vnto her, I am he, that speake vnto thee.

27. And vpon that, came his disciples, and marueiled that he talked with a woman: yet no man said vnto him, What askest thou? or why talkest thou with her?

28. The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the citie, and said to the men,

29. Come, see a man which hath tolde me all things that euer I did: is not he that Christ?

30. Then they went out of the citie, and came vnto him.

31. In the meane while, the disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eate.

32. 
          

33. Then said ye disciples betweene themselues, Hath any man brought him meate?

34. Iesus saide vnto them, My meate is that I may doe the will of him that sent me, and finish his worke.

35. 
          

36. 
          

37. And herein is that 

38. I sent you to reape that, whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entred into their labours.

39. 
          

40. Then when the Samaritans were come vnto him, they besought him, that he woulde tarie with them: and he abode there two dayes.

41. And many moe beleeued because of his owne word.

42. And they said vnto the woman, Nowe we beleeue, not because of thy saying: for we haue heard him our selues, and knowe that this is in deede that Christ the Sauiour of the world.

43. 
          

44. For Iesus himselfe had testified, that a Prophet hath none honour in his owne countrey.

45. Then when he was come into Galile, the Galileans receiued him, which had seene all the things that he did at Hierusalem at the feast: for they went also vnto the feast.

46. 
          

47. When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galile, he went vnto him, and besought him that he would goe downe, and heale his sonne: for he was euen ready to die.

48. Then saide Iesus vnto him, Except ye see signes and wonders, ye will not beleeue.

49. The ruler said vnto him, Syr, goe downe before my sonne dye.

50. Iesus said vnto him, Go thy way, thy sonne liueth: and the man beleeued the worde that Iesus had spoken vnto him, and went his way.

51. And as he was nowe going downe, his seruants met him, saying, Thy sonne liueth.

52. Then enquired he of them the houre when he began to amend; they said vnto him, Yesterday the seuenth houre the feuer left him.

53. Then the father knew, that it was the same houre in the which Iesus had said vnto him, Thy sonne liueth; he beleeued, & all his houshold.

54. This second miracle did Iesus againe, after he was come out of Iudea into Galile.

## John 5

1. After that, there was a feast of the Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.

2. 
          

3. In the which lay a great multitude of sicke folke, of blinde, halte, and withered, wayting for the mouing of the water.

4. For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole, and troubled the water: whosoeuer then first, after the stirring of the water, stepped in, was made whole of whatsoeuer disease he had.

5. And a certaine man was there, which had bene diseased eight and thirtie yeeres.

6. When Iesus sawe him lie, and knew that he nowe long time had bene diseased, he saide vnto him, Wilt thou be made whole?

7. The sicke man answered him, Sir, I haue no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the poole: but while I am coming, another steppeth downe before me.

8. Iesus said vnto him, Rise: take vp thy bed, and walke.

9. And immediately the man was made whole, and tooke vp his bed, and walked: and the same day was the Sabbath.

10. 
          

11. He answered them, He that made me whole, he said vnto me, Take vp thy bed, and walke.

12. Then asked they him, What man is that which said vnto thee, Take vp thy bed and walke?

13. And he that was healed, knewe not who it was: for Iesus had conueied himselfe away from the multitude that was in that place.

14. And after that, Iesus founde him in the Temple, and said vnto him, Beholde, thou art made whole: sinne no more, lest a worse thing come vnto thee.

15. The man departed and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus, which had made him whole.

16. And therefore the Iewes did persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.

17. 
          

18. Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was 

19. Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing 

20. For the Father loueth the Sonne, & sheweth him all things, whatsoeuer he himselfe doeth, and he will shewe him greater workes then these, that ye should marueile.

21. 
          

22. For the Father 

23. Because that all men shoulde honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the Sonne, the same honoureth not the Father, which hath sent him.

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. For as the Father hath life in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe,

27. And hath given him 

28. 
          

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not 

32. There is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I know that the witnesse, which he beareth of me, is true.

33. 
          

34. But I receiue not the record of man: neuerthelesse these things I say, that ye might be saued.

35. He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for 

36. But I haue greater witnesse then the witnesse of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish, the same workes that I doe, beare witnesse of me, that the Father sent me.

37. And the Father himselfe, which hath sent me, beareth witnesse of me. Ye haue not heard his voyce at any time, neither haue ye seene his shape.

38. And his worde haue you not abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeued not.

39. Searche the Scriptures: for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me.

40. But ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life.

41. I receiue not the prayse of men.

42. But I know you, that ye have not the 

43. I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in his owne name, him will ye receiue.

44. How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth of God alone?

45. 
          

46. For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for he wrote of me.

47. But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shal ye beleeue my wordes?

## John 6

1. After these things Jesus went 

2. And a great multitude followed him, because they sawe his miracles, which hee did on them that were diseased.

3. Then Iesus went vp into a mountaine, and there he sate with his disciples.

4. Now the Passeouer, a feast of the Iewes, was neere.

5. 
          

6. (And this he sayde to prooue him: for hee himselfe knewe what he would doe.)

7. Philippe answered him, Two hundreth penie worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that euery one of them may take a litle.

8. Then saide vnto him one of his disciples, Andrewe, Simon Peters brother,

9. There is a little boy heere, which hath fiue barlie loaues, and two fishes: but what are they among so many?

10. And Iesus saide, Make ye people sit downe. (Nowe there was much grasse in that place.) Then the men sate downe in nomber, about fiue thousande.

11. And Iesus tooke the bread, & gaue thanks, & gaue to the disciples, and the disciples, to them that were set downe: and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

12. And when they were satisfied, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the broken meat which remaineth, that nothing be lost.

13. Then they gathered it together, and filled twelue baskets with the broken meat of the fiue barly loaues, which remained vnto them that had eaten.

14. Then the men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, saide, This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. And entered into a ship, and went over the sea 

18. And the Sea arose with a great winde that blewe.

19. And when they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they sawe Iesus walking on the sea, and drawing neere vnto the ship: so they were afraide.

20. But he said vnto them, It is I: be not afraid.

21. Then they 

22. The day following, the people which stoode on the other side of the sea, saw that there was none other ship there, saue that one, whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not with his disciples in the ship, but that his disciples were gone alone,

23. And that there came other ships from Tiberias neere vnto the place where they ate the bread, after the Lord had giuen thankes.

24. Nowe when the people sawe that Iesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also tooke shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Iesus.

25. And when they had founde him on the other side of the sea, they sayde vnto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the 

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. Our fathers did eate Manna in the desart, as it is written, Hee gaue them bread from heauen to eate.

32. 
          

33. For the breade of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto the world.

34. Then they said vnto him, Lorde, euermore giue vs this bread.

35. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread 

36. But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.

37. 
          

38. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine 

39. And this is the Fathers will which hath sent mee, that of all which hee hath giuen mee, I should lose nothing, but shoulde raise it vp againe at the last day.

40. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which 

41. 
          

42. And they said, Is not this Iesus that sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother wee knowe? Howe then sayth he, I came downe from heauen?

43. Iesus then answered, and saide vnto them, Murmure not among your selues.

44. No man can come to mee, except the Father, which hath sent mee, drawe him: and I will raise him vp at the last day.

45. It is written in the 

46. Not that any man hath seen the Father, 

47. Verely, verely I say vnto you, hee that beleeueth in me, hath euerlasting life.

48. 
          

49. Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead.

50. 
          

51. 
          

52. 
          

53. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have 

54. Whosoeuer eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day.

55. For my flesh is meat in deede, & my blood is drinke in deede.

56. Hee that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.

57. As 

58. This is that bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers haue eaten Manna, and are deade. Hee that eateth of this bread, shall liue for euer.

59. These things spake he in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

60. 
          

61. But Iesus knowing in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at this, saide vnto them, Doeth this offend you?

62. What then if yee should see that Sonne of man ascend vp where he was before?

63. 
          

64. But there are some of you that beleeue not: for Iesus knewe from the beginning, which they were that beleeued not, & who shoulde betray him.

65. And hee saide, Therefore saide I vnto you, that no man can come vnto mee, except it be giuen vnto him of my Father.

66. 
          

67. Then sayde Iesus to the twelue, Will yee also goe away?

68. Then Simon Peter answered him, Master, to whome shall we goe? thou hast the wordes of eternall life:

69. And we beleeue and knowe that thou art that Christ that Sonne of the liuing God.

70. 
          

71. Now he spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that shoulde betraie him, though he was one of the twelue.

## John 7

1. After these things, Iesus walked in Galile, and woulde not walke in Iudea: for the Iewes sought to kill him.

2. Now the Jews' 

3. 
          

4. For there is no man that doeth any thing secretely, and hee himselfe seeketh to be famous. If thou doest these things, shewe thy selfe to the worlde.

5. For neither did his 

6. 
          

7. The world can not hate you: but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that the workes thereof are euill.

8. Go ye vp vnto this feast: I wil not go vp yet vnto this feast: for my time is not yet fulfilled.

9. These things he sayde vnto them, and abode still in Galile.

10. 
          

11. Then the Iewes sought him at the feast, and saide, Where is hee?

12. And much murmuring was there of him among the people. Some said, He is a good man: other sayd, Nay: but he deceiueth the people.

13. Howbeit no man spake 

14. 
          

15. And the Iewes marueiled, saving, Howe knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that hee neuer learned!

16. 
          

17. If any man will doe his will, he shall knowe of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe.

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. The people answered, and said, Thou hast a deuil: who goeth about to kill thee?

21. 
          

22. Moses therefore gaue vnto you circumcision, (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers) & ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.

23. If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the 

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. And beholde, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him: doe the rulers know in deede that this is in deede that Christ?

27. 
          

28. 
          

29. But I knowe him: for I am of him, and he hath sent me.

30. 
          

31. Now many of the people beleeued in him, and said, When that Christ commeth, will he doe moe miracles then this man hath done?

32. 
          

33. Then saide Iesus vnto them, Yet am I a little while with you, and then goe I vnto him that sent mee.

34. Ye shall seeke me, and shall not finde me, and where I am, can ye not come.

35. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the 

36. What saying is this that hee saide, Ye shall seeke mee, and shall not finde mee? and where I am, cannot ye come?

37. 
          

38. He that believeth on me, as the 

39. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the 

40. 
          

41. Other saide, This is that Christ: and some said, But shall that Christ come out of Galile?

42. Saith not the Scripture that that Christ shall come of the seede of Dauid, and out of the towne of Beth-leem, where Dauid was?

43. So was there dissension among the people for him.

44. And some of them would haue taken him, but no man layde handes on him.

45. 
          

46. The officers answered, Neuer man spake like this man.

47. Then answered them the Pharises, Are yee also deceiued?

48. 
          

49. But this people, which know not the Law, are cursed.

50. Nicodemus said vnto them, ( he that came to Iesus by night, and was one of them.)

51. Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know 

52. They answered, and said vnto him, Art thou also of Galile? Searche and looke: for out of Galile ariseth no Prophet.

## John 8

1. And Iesus went vnto the mount of Oliues,

2. And early in the morning came againe into the Temple, and all the people came vnto him, and he sate downe, and taught them.

3. 
          

4. And said vnto him, Master, we foud this woman committing adulterie, euen in the very acte.

5. Now Moses in our Law commanded, that such should be stoned: what sayest thou therefore?

6. And this they saide to tempt him, that they might haue, whereof to accuse him. But Iesus stouped downe, & with his finger wrote on the groud.

7. 
          

8. And againe hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground.

9. And when they heard it, being accused by their owne conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at ye eldest euen to the last: so Iesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the mids.

10. 
          

11. She said, No man, Lord; Iesus said, Neither do I condemne thee: go and sinne no more.

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Jesus answered and said unto them, 

15. Ye judge after the flesh; I 

16. And if I also iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I, and the Father, that sent mee.

17. And it is also written in your Lawe, that the testimonie of two men is true.

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. These words spake Jesus in the 

21. 
          

22. Then said the Iewes, Will he kill himselfe, because he saith, Whither I goe, can ye not come?

23. And hee saide vnto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from aboue: ye are of this world, I am not of this worlde.

24. I said therefore vnto you, That ye shall die in your sinnes: for except ye beleeue, that I am he, ye shall die in your sinnes.

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. Then said Iesus vnto them, When ye haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I doe nothing of my selfe, but as my Father hath taught me, so I speake these things.

29. For he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone, because I do alwayes those things that please him.

30. As hee spake these thinges, many beleeued in him.

31. 
          

32. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall 

33. 
          

34. Iesus answered them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne.

35. And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: but the Sonne abideth for euer.

36. If that Sonne therefore shal make you free, ye shalbe free in deede.

37. 
          

38. I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye doe that which ye haue seene with your father.

39. They answered, and saide vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus said vnto them, If ye were Abrahams children, ye woulde doe the workes of Abraham.

40. But nowe ye goe about to kill mee, a man that haue told you the trueth, which I haue heard of God: this did not Abraham.

41. Ye do the workes of your father. Then said they to him, We are not borne of fornication: we haue one Father, which is God.

42. Therefore Iesus sayde vnto them, If God were your Father, then woulde ye loue mee: for I proceeded foorth, and came from God, neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me.

43. Why do ye not understand my 

44. Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the 

45. And because I tell you the trueth, yee beleeue me not.

46. 
          

47. He that is of God, heareth Gods wordes: yee therefore heare them not, because ye are not of God.

48. 
          

49. Iesus answered, I haue not a deuil, but I honour my Father, and ye haue dishonoured me.

50. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one 

51. 
          

52. 
          

53. Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are dead: whome makest thou thy selfe?

54. 
          

55. 
          

56. 
          

57. Then sayd ye Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeere olde, & hast thou seene Abraham?

58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I

## John 9

1. And 

2. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sinne, this man, or his parents, that he was borne blinde?

3. Jesus answered, 

4. 
          

5. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

6. 
          

7. And sayd vnto him, Go wash in the poole of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came againe seeing.

8. 
          

9. Some said, This is he: and other sayd, He is like him: but he himselfe sayd, I am he.

10. Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes 

11. He answered, and sayd, The man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and sayde vnto me, Goe to the poole of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and receiued sight.

12. Then they sayd vnto him, Where is he? He sayd, I can not tell.

13. They brought to the Pharises him that was once blinde.

14. And it was the Sabbath day, when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

15. Then againe the Pharises also asked him, how he had receiued sight; hee sayd vnto them, He layd clay vpon mine eyes, & I washed, and doe see.

16. 
          

17. Then spake they vnto the blinde againe, What sayest thou of him, because he hath opened thine eyes? And he sayd, He is a Prophet.

18. Then the Iewes did not beleeue him (that he had bene blinde, and receiued his sight) vntill they had called the parents of him that had receiued sight.

19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, whom ye say was borne blinde? How doeth he nowe see then?

20. His parents answered them, and sayd, We know that this is our sonne, & that he was borne blinde:

21. But by what meanes hee nowe seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, can we not tell: he is olde ynough: aske him: hee shall answere for himselfe.

22. These wordes spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes had ordeined already, that if any man did confesse that he was Christ, he should be excommunicate out of the Synagogue.

23. Therefore sayde his parents, Hee is olde ynough: aske him.

24. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, 

25. Then he answered, and sayd, Whether hee be a sinner or no, I can not tell: one thing I know, that I was blinde, and nowe I see.

26. Then sayd they to him againe, What did he to thee? howe opened he thine eyes?

27. Hee answered them, I haue tolde you already, and yee haue not heard it: wherefore would yee heare it againe? will yee also be his disciples?

28. 
          

29. We know that God spake with Moses: but this man we know not from whence he is.

30. The man answered, and sayde vnto them, Doutlesse, this is a marueilous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.

31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him heareth he.

32. Since the world began, was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde.

33. If this man were not of God, hee could haue done nothing.

34. They answered and said unto him, 

35. 
          

36. He answered, and sayd, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue in him?

37. And Iesus sayd vnto him, Both thou hast seene him, and he it is that talketh with thee.

38. Then he sayd, Lord, I beleeue, and worshipped him.

39. 
          

40. And some of the Pharises which were with him, heard these things, & sayd vnto him, Are we blinde also?

41. Iesus sayd vnto them, If ye were blinde, ye should not haue sinne: but nowe ye say, We see: therefore your sinne remaineth.

## John 10

1. Verily, 

2. But he that goeth in by the doore, is the shepheard of the sheepe.

3. To him the 

4. And when hee hath sent foorth his owne sheepe, he goeth before them, and the sheepe follow him: for they know his voyce.

5. And they will not follow a stranger, but they flee from him: for they know not the voyce of strangers.

6. This 

7. Then sayd Iesus vnto them againe, Verely, verely I say vnto you, I am that doore of the sheepe.

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. The theefe commeth not, but for to steale, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might haue life, and haue it in abundance.

11. I am that good shepheard: that good shepheard giueth his life for his sheepe.

12. But an hireling, and hee which is not the shepheard, neither the sheepe are his owne, seeth the wolfe comming, and hee leaueth the sheepe, and fleeth, and the wolfe catcheth them, and scattreth the sheepe.

13. So the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheepe.

14. I am that good shepheard, & knowe mine, and am knowen of mine.

15. As the Father 

16. 
          

17. 
          

18. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe: I haue power to lay it downe, and haue power to take it againe: this commandement haue I receiued of my Father.

19. 
          

20. And many of them sayd, He hath a deuill, and is mad: why heare ye him?

21. Other sayd, These are not the wordes of him that hath a deuill: can the deuill open the eyes of the blinde?

22. And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the 

23. 
          

24. Then came the Iewes round about him, and sayd vnto him, Howe long doest thou make vs dout? If thou be that Christ, tell vs plainely.

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. My sheepe heare my voyce, and I knowe them, and they follow me,

28. And I giue vnto them eternall life, & they shall neuer perish, neither shall any plucke them out of mine hand.

29. My Father which gaue them me, is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.

30. I and my Father are one.

31. 
          

32. Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my 

33. The Iewes answered him, saying, For the good worke we stone thee not, but for blasphemie, and that thou being a man, makest thy selfe God.

34. Iesus answered them, Is it not written in your Lawe, I sayd, Ye are gods?

35. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be 

36. Say ye of him, whome the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the worlde, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Sonne of God?

37. If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue me not.

38. But if I doe, then though ye beleeue not mee, yet beleeue the workes, that ye may knowe and beleeue, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

39. 
          

40. And went againe beyonde Iordan, into the place where Iohn first baptized, and there abode.

41. And many resorted vnto him, and saide, Iohn did no miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man, were true.

42. And many beleeued in him there.

## John 11

1. Now 

2. (And it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with oyntment, and wiped his feete with her heare, whose brother Lazarus was sicke.)

3. Therefore his sisters sent vnto him, saying, Lord, beholde, he whome thou louest, is sicke.

4. When Iesus heard it, he saide, This sickenes is not vnto death, but for the glorie of God, that the Sonne of God might be glorified thereby.

5. Nowe Iesus loued Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.

6. 
          

7. Then after that, said he to his disciples, Let vs goe into Iudea againe.

8. 
          

9. Jesus answered, Are there not 

10. But if a man walke in the night, hee stumbleth, because there is no light in him.

11. These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus 

12. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepe, he shalbe safe.

13. Howbeit, Iesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of the naturall sleepe.

14. Then saide Iesus vnto them plainely, Lazarus is dead.

15. And I am glad for your sakes, that I was not there, that ye may beleeue: but let vs go vnto him.

16. Then saide Thomas (which is called Didymus) vnto his felow disciples, Let vs also goe, that we may die with him.

17. Then came Iesus, and found that he had lien in the graue foure dayes alreadie.

18. (Nowe Bethania was neere vnto Hierusalem, about fifteene furlongs off.)

19. 
          

20. Then Martha, when shee heard that Iesus was comming, went to meete him: but Mary sate still in the house.

21. Then said Martha vnto Iesus, Lord, if thou hadst bene here, my brother had not bene dead.

22. But now I know also, that whatsoeuer thou askest of God, God will giue it thee.

23. Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall 

24. Martha said vnto him, I know that he shall rise againe in the resurrection at the last day.

25. Iesus saide vnto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he liue.

26. And whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth in me, shall neuer die: Beleeuest thou this?

27. She said vnto him, Yea, Lord, I beleeue that thou art that Christ that Sonne of God, which should come into the world.

28. And when she had so saide, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

29. And when she heard it, shee arose quickly, and came vnto him.

30. For Iesus was not yet come into the towne, but was in the place where Martha met him.

31. The Iewes then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they sawe Marie, that she rose vp hastily, & went out, folowed her, saying, She goeth vnto the graue, to weepe there.

32. Then when Mary was come where Iesus was, and sawe him, she fell downe at his feete, saying vnto him, Lord, if thou haddest bene here, my brother had not bene dead.

33. 
          

34. And saide, Where haue ye layde him? They said vnto him, Lord, come and see.

35. And Iesus wept.

36. Then saide the Iewes, Beholde, how he loued him.

37. And some of them saide, Coulde not he, which opened the eyes of the blinde, haue made also, that this man should not haue died?

38. Iesus therefore againe groned in himselfe, and came to the graue; it was a caue, and a stone was layde vpon it.

39. Iesus saide, Take ye away the stone. Martha the sister of him that was dead, said vnto him, Lorde, he stinketh alreadie: for he hath bene dead foure dayes.

40. Iesus saide vnto her, Saide I not vnto thee, that if thou diddest beleeue, thou shouldest see the glorie of God?

41. Then they tooke away the stone from the place where the dead was layde; Iesus lift vp his eyes, and saide, Father, I thanke thee, because thou hast heard me.

42. I knowe that thou hearest me alwayes, but because of the people that stand by, I said it, that they may beleeue, that thou hast sent me.

43. As hee had spoken these things, hee cried with a loude voyce, Lazarus, come foorth.

44. Then he that was dead, came forth, bound hande and foote with bandes, and his face was bound with a napkin. Iesus said vnto them, Loose him, and let him goe.

45. Then many of the Iewes, which came to Mary, and had seene the thinges, which Iesus did, beleeued in him.

46. 
          

47. Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a

49. 
          

50. Nor yet doe you consider that it is expedient for vs, that one man die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

51. 
          

52. And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that 

53. Then from that day foorth they consulted together, to put him to death.

54. 
          

55. And the Iewes Passeouer was at hande, and many went out of the countrey vp to Hierusalem before the Passeouer, to purifie themselues.

56. Then sought they for Iesus, and spake among themselues, as they stoode in the Temple, What thinke ye, that he cometh not to the feast?

57. Nowe both the hie Priestes and the Pharises had giuen a commaundement, that if any man knew where he were, he should shewe it, that they might take him.

## John 12

1. Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passeouer, came to Bethania, where Lazarus was, who died, whom he had raised from the dead.

2. There they made him a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him.

3. Then tooke Mary a pound of oyntment of Spikenarde very costly, and anoynted Iesus feete, and wiped his feete with her heare, and the house was filled with the sauour of the oyntment.

4. Then said one of his disciples, euen Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, which should betray him:

5. 
          

6. Nowe he said this, not that he cared for the poore, but because hee was a theefe, and had the bagge, and bare that which was giuen.

7. 
          

8. For the poore alwayes yee haue with you, but me ye shall not haue alwayes.

9. 
          

10. The hie Priestes therefore consulted, that they might put Lazarus to death also,

11. Because that for his sake many of the Iewes went away, and beleeued in Iesus.

12. On the morowe a great multitude that were come to the feast, when they heard that Iesus should come to Hierusalem,

13. Tooke branches of palme trees, and went foorth to meete him, and cried, Hosanna, Blessed is the King of Israel that commeth in the Name of the Lorde.

14. And Iesus found a yong asse, and sate thereon, as it is written,

15. Feare not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King commeth sitting on an asses colte.

16. But his disciples vnderstoode not these thinges at the first: but when Iesus was glorified, then remembred they, that these thinges were written of him, and that they had done these things vnto him.

17. The people therefore that was with him, bare witnesse that hee called Lazarus out of the graue, and raised him from the dead.

18. Therefore mette him the people also, because they heard that he had done this miracle.

19. 
          

20. And there were certain Greeks among them that 

21. And they came to Philippe, which was of Bethsaida in Galile, and desired him, saying, Syr, we would see that Iesus.

22. Philippe came and tolde Andrewe: and againe Andrewe and Philippe tolde Iesus.

23. And Iesus answered them, saying, The houre is come, that the Sonne of man must bee glorified.

24. 
          

25. He that loueth his life, shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keepe it vnto life eternall.

26. If any man serue me, let him followe me: for where I am, there shall also my seruant be: and if any man serue me, him will my Father honour.

27. 
          

28. Father, 

29. Then saide the people that stoode by, and heard, that it was a thunder: other said, An Angel spake to him.

30. 
          

31. Now is the iudgement of this world: nowe shall the prince of this world be cast out.

32. And I, if I be 

33. Nowe this sayd he, signifying what death he should die.

34. The people answered him, We haue heard out of the Law, that that Christ bideth for euer: and howe sayest thou, that that Sonne of man must be lift vp? Who is that Sonne of man?

35. 
          

36. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the

40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart, that they shoulde not see with their eyes, nor vnderstand with their heart, and should be conuerted, and I should heale them.

41. These things sayd Esaias when he sawe his glory, and spake of him.

42. 
          

43. For they loued the prayse of men, more then the prayse of God.

44. 
          

45. And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.

46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoeuer beleeueth in me, should not abide in darkenes.

47. And if any man heare my wordes, and beleeue not, I iudge him not: for I came not to iudge the world, but to saue the world.

48. He that refuseth me, and receiueth not my wordes, hath one that iudgeth him: the worde that I haue spoken, it shall iudge him in the last day.

49. For I haue not spoken of my selfe: but the Father which sent me, hee gaue me a commaundement what I should say, and what I should speake.

50. And I knowe that his commaundement is life euerlasting: the thinges therefore that I speake, I speake them so as the Father sayde vnto me.

8. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast

10. Iesus sayd to him, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to wash his feete, but is cleane euery whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.

11. For hee knewe who should betray him: therefore sayd he, Ye are not all cleane.

12. So after he had washed their feete, and had taken his garments, and was set downe againe, he sayd vnto them, Knowe ye what I haue done to you?

13. Ye call me Master, and Lorde, and ye say well: for so am I.

14. If I then your Lorde, and Master, haue washed your feete, ye also ought to wash one an others feete.

15. For I haue giuen you an example, that ye should doe, euen as I haue done to you.

16. Verely, verely I say vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master, neither the ambassadour greater then he that sent him.

17. If ye know these things, blessed are ye, if ye doe them.

18. 
          

19. From henceforth tell I you before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye might beleeue that I am he.

20. Verely, verely I say vnto you, If I send any, he that receiueth him, receiueth me, and hee that receiueth me, receiueth him that sent me.

21. When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and 

22. Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.

23. Now there was 

24. To him beckened therefore Simon Peter, that he should aske who it was of whom he spake.

25. He then, as he leaned on Iesus breast, saide vnto him, Lord, who is it?

26. Iesus answered, He it is, to whome I shall giue a soppe, when I haue dipt it: and hee wet a soppe, and gaue it to Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne.

27. And after the soppe, Satan entred into him. Then sayd Iesus vnto him, That thou doest, doe quickly.

28. But none of them that were at table, knew, for what cause he spake it vnto him.

29. For some of them thought because Iudas had the bag, that Iesus had sayd vnto him, Buy those things that we haue neede of against ye feast: or that he should giue some thing to the poore.

30. Assoone then as he had receiued the soppe, he went immediately out, and it was night.

31. 
          

32. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him in himselfe, and shal straightway glorifie him.

33. 
          

34. A newe commaundement giue I vnto you, that ye loue one another: as I haue loued you, that ye also loue one another.

35. By this shall all men knowe that ye are my disciples, if ye haue loue one to another.

36. 
          

37. Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, why can I not followe thee now? I will lay downe my life for thy sake.

38. Iesus answered him, Wilt thou lay downe thy life for my sake? Verely, verely I say vnto thee, The cocke shall not crowe, till thou haue denied me thrise.

6. Jesus saith unto him, I am

8. Philippe sayd vnto him, Lord, shewe vs thy Father, and it sufficeth vs.

9. Iesus sayd vnto him, I haue bene so long time with you, and hast thou not knowen mee, Philippe? he that hath seene me, hath seene my Father: how then sayest thou, Shewe vs thy Father?

10. 
          

11. Beleeue me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me: at the least, beleeue me for the very workes sake.

12. 
          

13. And whatsoeuer ye aske in my Name, that will I doe, that the Father may be glorified in the Sonne.

14. If ye shall aske any thing in my Name, I will doe it.

15. 
          

16. And I wil pray the Father, and he shal giue you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for euer,

18. I will not leaue you fatherles: but I will come to you.

19. Yet a litle while, and the world shal see me no more, but ye shall see me: because I liue, ye shall liue also.

20. At that day ye shall know that I [am] 

21. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will 

22. 
          

23. Iesus answered, and sayd vnto him, If any man loue me, he will keepe my worde, and my Father will loue him, and we wil come vnto him, and wil dwell with him.

24. He that loueth me not, keepeth not my wordes, & the worde which ye heare, is not mine, but the Fathers which sent me.

25. 
          

26. But the Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father wil send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, which I haue tolde you.

27. 
          

28. 
          

29. And nowe haue I spoken vnto you, before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye might beleeue.

30. 
          

31. But it is that the world may knowe that I loue my Father: and as the Father hath commanded me, so I doe. Arise, let vs goe hence.

2. Euery branch that beareth not fruite in me, he taketh away: and euery one that beareth fruite, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruite.

3. Nowe are ye cleane through the worde, which I haue spoken vnto you.

4. Abide in me, and I in you: as the branche cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

5. I am that vine: ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, & I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruite: for without me can ye doe nothing.

6. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branche, and withereth: and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they burne.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. If ye shall keepe my commandements, ye shall abide in my loue, as I haue kept my Fathers commandements, and abide in his loue.

11. These things haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remaine in you, and that your ioy might be full.

12. This is my commandement, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you.

13. Greater loue then this hath no man, when any man bestoweth his life for his friendes.

14. Ye are my friendes, if ye doe whatsoeuer I commaund you.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. These things commaunde I you, that ye loue one another.

18. 
          

19. If ye were of the worlde, the world woulde loue his owne: but because ye are not of ye world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

20. Remember the word that I said vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master. If they haue persecuted me, they will persecute you also: if they haue kept my worde, they will also keepe yours.

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.

24. If I had not done workes among them which none other man did, they had not had sinne: but nowe haue they both seene, and haue hated both me, and my Father.

25. But [this cometh to pass], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their

## John 16

1. These 

2. They shall excommunicate you: yea, the time shall come, that whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that he doeth God seruice.

3. And these things will they doe vnto you, because they haue not knowen ye Father, nor me.

4. But these things haue I tolde you, that when the houre shall come, ye might remember, that I tolde you them; these things said I not vnto you from ye beginning, because I was with you.

5. But now I go my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?

6. But because I haue saide these thinges vnto you, your hearts are full of sorowe.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. Of sinne, because they beleeued not in me:

10. Of

13. Howbeit, when he is come which is the Spirit of trueth, he will leade you into all trueth: for he shall not speake of himselfe, but whatsoeuer he shall heare, shall he speake, and he will shew you the things to come.

14. 
          

15. All thinges that the Father hath, are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shewe it vnto you.

16. 
          

17. Then said some of his disciples among them selues, What is this that he saieth vnto vs, A litle while, and ye shall not see me, and againe, a litle while, and ye shall see me, and, For I goe to the Father.

18. They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A litle while? we know not what he sayeth.

19. Now Iesus knew that they would aske him, and said vnto them, Doe ye enquire among your selues, of that I said, A litle while, & ye shal not see me: and againe, a litle while, and yee shall see me?

20. Verely, verely I say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, and the worlde shall reioyce: and ye shall sorowe, but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioye.

21. A woman when she traueileth, hath sorowe, because her houre is come: but assoone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguish, for ioy that a man is borne into the world.

22. And ye nowe therefore are in sorowe: but I will see you againe, & your hearts shal reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you.

23. And in that day shall ye aske me nothing. Verely, verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my Name, he will giue it you.

24. Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that your ioye may be full.

25. 
          

26. 
          

27. For the Father himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me, and haue beleeued that I came out from God.

28. I am come out from the Father, and came into the worlde: againe I leaue the worlde, and goe to the Father.

29. 
          

30. Nowe knowe wee that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should aske thee. By this we beleeue, that thou art come out from God.

8. For I haue giuen vnto them the wordes which thou gauest me, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowen surely that I came out from thee, & haue beleeued that thou hast sent me.

9. I pray for them: I pray not for the worlde, but for them which thou hast giuen me: for they are thine.

10. And al mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.

2. And Iudas which betraied him, knewe also the place: for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. They answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus sayde vnto them, I am hee. Nowe Iudas also which betraied him, stoode with them.

6. Assoone then as hee had saide vnto them, I am hee, they went away backewardes, and fell to the grounde.

7. Then he asked them againe, Whome seeke yee? And they sayd, Iesus of Nazareth.

8. 
          

9. This was that the worde might be fulfilled which hee spake, Of them which thou gauest me, haue I lost none.

10. 
          

11. Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sworde into the sheath: shall I not drinke of the cuppe which my Father hath giuen me?

12. Then the bande and the captaine, and the officers of the Iewes tooke Iesus, and bound him,

13. 
          

14. And Caiaphas was he, that gaue counsel to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

15. 
          

16. But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out the other disciple which was knowen vnto the hie Priest, and spake to her that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.

17. Then saide the maide that kept the doore, vnto Peter, Art not thou also one of this mans disciples? He sayd, I am not.

18. And the seruants and officers stoode there, which had made a fire of coles: for it was colde, & they warmed themselues; Peter also stood among them, and warmed himselfe.

19. 
          

20. Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world: I euer taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes resort continually, and in secret haue I sayde nothing.

21. Why askest thou mee? aske them which heard mee what I sayde vnto them: beholde, they knowe what I sayd.

22. When he had spoken these thinges, one of the officers which stoode by, smote Iesus with his rod, saying, Answerest thou the hie Priest so?

23. Iesus answered him, If I haue euill spoken, beare witnes of the euil: but if I haue well spoken, why smitest thou me?

24. Nowe Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the hie Priest)

25. 
          

26. One of the seruaunts of the hie Priest, his cousin whose eare Peter smote off, saide, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?

27. Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crewe.

28. 
          

29. Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring yee against this man?

30. They answered, and saide vnto him, If hee were not an euill doer, we woulde not haue deliuered him vnto thee.

31. Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, 

32. That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, 

33. So Pilate entred into the common hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde vnto him, Art thou the king of the Iewes?

34. Iesus answered him, Saiest thou that of thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me?

35. Pilate answered, Am I a Iewe? Thine owne nation, and the hie Priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me. What hast thou done?

36. 
          

37. Pilate then said vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King: for this cause am I borne, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should beare witnes vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the trueth, heareth my voyce.

38. 
          

39. But you haue a custome, that I shoulde deliuer you one loose at the Passeouer: will yee then that I loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?

40. Then 

## John 19

1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and 

2. And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple garment,

3. And saide, Haile, King of the Iewes; they smote him with their roddes.

4. 
          

5. Then came Iesus foorth wearing a crowne of thornes, and a purple garment; Pilate said vnto them, Beholde the man.

6. When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, 

7. The Iewes answered him, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himselfe the Sonne of God.

8. 
          

9. And went againe into the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere.

10. Then saide Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, & haue power to loose thee?

11. Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne.

12. From thence foorth Pilate sought to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying, If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Cesar.

13. 
          

14. And it was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.

15. But they cried, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The high Priestes answered, We haue no King but Cesar.

16. 
          

17. And he bare his owne crosse, and came into a place named of dead mens Skulles, which is called in Hebrewe, «Golgotha»:

18. Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middes.

19. 
          

20. This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was neere to the citie: and it was written in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine.

21. Then saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that he sayd, I am King of the Iewes.

22. Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.

23. 
          

24. Therefore they sayde one to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which sayth, They parted my garments among them, and on my coate did cast lots. So the souldiers did these things in deede.

25. 
          

26. And when Iesus sawe his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde thy sonne.

27. Then saide he to the disciple, Beholde thy mother: and from that houre, the disciple tooke her home vnto him.

28. 
          

29. Now there was set a 

30. Nowe when Iesus had receiued of the vineger, he saide, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.

31. 
          

32. Then came the souldiers and brake the legges of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with Iesus.

33. But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges.

34. 
          

35. And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleeue it.

36. For these things were done, that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shalbe broken.

37. And againe an other Scripture saith, They shall see him whom they haue thrust through.

38. 
          

39. And there came also Nicodemus (which first came to Iesus by night) & brought of myrrhe and aloes mingled together about an hundreth pound.

40. Then tooke they the body of Iesus, and wrapped it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie.

41. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was 

42. There then laide they Iesus, because of the Iewes Preparation day, for the sepulchre was neere.

2. Then she ranne, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Iesus loued, and saide vnto them, They haue taken away the Lorde out of the sepulchre, and we knowe not where they haue laid him.

3. Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they came vnto the sepulchre.

4. So they ranne both together, but the other disciple did outrunne Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

5. And he stouped downe, and sawe the linnen clothes lying: yet went he not in.

6. Then came Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and sawe the linnen clothes lye,

7. And the kerchiefe that was vpon his head, not lying with the linnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it selfe.

8. Then went in also the other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he sawe it, and beleeued.

9. For as yet they knewe not the Scripture, That he must rise againe from the dead.

10. And the disciples went away againe vnto their owne home.

11. But Mary stood 

12. 
          

13. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away 

14. 
          

15. Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She supposing that he had bene the gardener, said vnto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

16. Iesus saith vnto her, Marie. She turned her selfe, and said vnto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.

17. 
          

18. Marie Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seene the Lord, and that he had spoken these things vnto her.

19. 
          

20. And when he had so saide, he shewed vnto them his handes, and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they had seene the Lord.

21. Then saide Iesus to them againe, Peace be vnto you: as my Father sent me, so sende I you.

22. And when he had saide that, he breathed on them, and saide vnto them, Receiue the holy Ghost.

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. The other disciples therefore saide vnto him, We haue seene the Lord: but he said vnto them, Except I see in his handes the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and put mine hand into his side, I will not beleeue it.

26. And eight dayes after, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Iesus, when the doores were shut, and stood in the middes, and said, Peace be vnto you.

27. After saide he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see mine hands, & put forth thine hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faithfull.

28. Then Thomas answered, & said vnto him, Thou art my Lord, and my God.

29. 
          

30. 
          

31. But these things are written, that ye might beleeue, that Iesus is that Christ that Sonne of God, and that in beleeuing ye might haue life through his Name.

## John 21

1. After these things 

2. There were together Simon Peter, & Thomas, which is called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galile, and the sonnes of Zebedeus, and two other of his disciples.

3. Simon Peter said vnto them, I go a fishing. They said vnto him, We also will goe with thee. They went their way & entred into a ship straightway, and that night caught they nothing.

4. But when the morning was nowe come, Iesus stoode on the shore: neuerthelesse the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus.

5. Iesus then said vnto them, Syrs, haue ye any meate? They answered him, No.

6. Then he said vnto them, Cast out the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall finde. So they cast out, & they were not able at all to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.

7. Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's 

8. But the other disciples came by shippe (for they were not farre from land, but about two hundreth cubites) and they drewe the net with fishes.

9. Assoone then as they were come to land, they sawe hoate coales, and fish laide thereon, and bread.
