12. Aram before and the Philistims behinde, and they shall deuoure Israel with open mouth: yet for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

13. For the people turneth not vnto him that smiteth them, neither doe they seeke the Lord of hostes.

14. Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and taile, branche and rush in one day.

15. The ancient and the honorable man, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the taile.

16. For the leaders of the people cause them to erre: and they that are led by them are deuoured.

17. Therefore shall the Lord haue no pleasure in their yong men, neither will he haue compassion of their fatherlesse and of their widowes: for euery one is an hypocrite and wicked, and euery mouth speaketh follie: yet for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out stil.

18. For wickedness 

19. Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall

8. For he sayeth, Are not my princes altogether Kings?

9. [Is] not Calno as 

10. Like as mine hand hath founde the kingdomes of the idoles, seeing their idoles were aboue Ierusalem, and aboue Samaria:

11. Shall not I, as I haue done to Samaria, and to the idoles thereof, so doe to Ierusalem and to the idoles thereof?

12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, [that] when the Lord hath performed 

13. Because he said, By ye power of mine owne hand haue I done it, and by my wisdome, because I am wise: therefore I haue remooued the borders of the people, and haue spoyled their treasures, and haue pulled downe the inhabitants like a valiant man.

14. And mine hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people, and as one gathereth egges that are left, so haue I gathered all the earth: and there was none to mooue the wing or to open the mouth, or to whisper.

21. The remnant shall returne, euen the remnant of Iaakob vnto the mightie God.

22. For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant of them shall return: the full end 

23. For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a full end, even 

24. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of 

25. But yet a very litle time, and the wrath shall be consumed, and mine anger in their destruction.

26. And the LORD of hosts shall raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of

3. And shall make him prudent in the feare of the Lord: for he shall not iudge after the sight of his eies, neither reproue by ye hearing of his eares.

4. But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall

8. And the sucking childe shall play vpon the hole of the aspe, and the wained childe shall put his hand vpon the cockatrice hole.

9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as

13. The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of

19. And Babel the glorie of kingdomes, the beautie and pride of the Chaldeans, shall be as the destruction of God in Sodom and Gomorah.

20. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the

## Isaiah 36

1. Now it came to pass 

2. And the King of Asshur sent Rabshakeh from Lachish toward Ierusalem vnto King Hezekiah, with a great hoste, & he stood by ye conduite of the vpper poole in the path of the fullers fielde.

3. Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was 

4. And 

5. I say, 

6. Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will enter his hand, and pierce it: so [is] 

7. But if thou say to me, We trust in the Lord our God. Is not that he, whose hie places & whose altars Hezekiah tooke downe, & said to Iudah & to Ierusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?

8. Nowe therefore giue hostages to my lorde the King of Asshur, and I wil giue thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders vpon them.

9. How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the 

10. And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, 

11. Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, 

12. Then said Rabshakeh, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee to speake these wordes, and not to the men that sit on the wall? that they may eate their owne doung, and drinke their owne pisse with you?

13. So Rabshakeh stood, & cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes language, and sayd, Heare the wordes of the great King, of the King of Asshur.

14. Thus saith the King, Let not Hezekiah deceiue you: for he shall not be able to deliuer you.

15. Neither let Hezekiah make you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lorde will surely deliuer vs: this citie shal not be giuen ouer into the hand of the King of Asshur.

16. Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make 

17. Till I come and bring you to a land like your owne land, euen a land of wheate, and wine, a land of bread and vineyardes,

18. Least Hezekiah deceiue you, saying, The Lord wil deliuer vs. Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered his land out of the hand of the King of Asshur?

19. Where [are] the gods of 

20. Who is hee among all the gods of these lands, that hath deliuered their countrey out of mine hand, that the Lorde should deliuer Ierusalem out of mine hand?

## Isaiah 37

6. And Isaiah sayde vnto them, Thus say vnto your master, Thus saith the Lorde, Be not afrayd of the wordes that thou hast heard, wherewith the seruants of the king of Asshur haue blasphemed me.

7. Behold, I will send a wind upon him, and he shall hear a 

8. So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against 

9. He heard also men say of Tirhakah, King of Ethiopia, Beholde, he is come out to fight against thee: and when he heard it, he sent other messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, 

11. Beholde, thou hast heard what the Kings of Asshur haue done to all lands in destroying them, and shalt thou be deliuered?

12. Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, [as] 

13. Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arpad, and the King of the citie of Sepharuaim, Hena and Iuah?

14. So Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went vp into the House of the Lorde, and Hezekiah spread it before the Lord.

15. And Hezekiah prayed vnto the Lorde, saying,

16. O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that 

17. Encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare: open thine eyes, O Lorde, and see, and heare all the wordes of Saneherib, who hath sent to blaspheme the liuing God.

18. Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and 

19. And haue cast their gods in ye fire: for they were no gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood or stone: therefore they destroyed them.

20. Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that 

21. Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent vnto Hezekiah, saying, Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, Because thou hast prayed vnto me, concerning Saneherib king of Asshur,

22. This [is] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The 

23. Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? [even] against the 

24. By thy seruants hast thou railed on the Lord, and sayd, By the multitude of my charets I am come vp to the top of the mountaines to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut downe the hie cedars thereof, and the faire firre trees thereof, and I will goe vp to the heightes of his top and to the forest of his fruitfull places.

25. I have dug, 

26. Hast thou not heard long ago, [how] I have done it; [and] of ancient times, 

27. Therefore their inhabitants [were] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and [as grain] blighted 

28. But I know thy abode, and thy 

29. Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my

31. And 

32. For out of Ierusalem shall goe a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeale of the Lord of hostes shall doe this.

33. Therefore thus sayth the Lord, concerning the King of Asshur, He shall not enter into this citie, nor shoote an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mount against it.

34. By the same way that he came, he shall returne, and not come into this citie, saith the Lord.

35. For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant 

36. Then the Angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the campe of Asshur an hundreth, fourescore, and fiue thousand: so when they arose early in the morning, beholde, they were all dead corpses.

37. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at

4. Then came the worde of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,

5. Goe, and say vnto Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord God of Dauid thy father, I haue heard thy prayer, and seene thy teares: behold, I will adde vnto thy dayes fifteene yeeres.
