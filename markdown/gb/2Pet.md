## 2 Peter 1

1. Simon 

2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you 

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. And with godlines, brotherly kindnes: and with brotherly kindnes, loue.

8. 
          

9. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and 

10. 
          

11. For by this meanes an entring shalbe ministred vnto you aboundantly into the euerlasting kingdome of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ.

12. 
          

13. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this 

14. Seeing I knowe that the time is at hand that I must lay downe this my tabernacle, euen as our Lord Iesus Christ hath shewed me.

15. I will endeuour therefore alwayes, that ye also may be able to haue remembrance of these things after my departing.

16. 
          

17. For he receiued of God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voyce to him from that excellent glory, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.

18. And this voyce we heard when it came from heauen, being with him in the Holy mount.

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but 

## 2 Peter 2

1. But 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to 

5. And spared not the 

6. And turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrhe into ashes, condemned them and ouerthrewe them, and made them an ensample vnto them that after should liue vngodly,

7. And deliuered iust Loth vexed with the vncleanly conuersation of the wicked:

8. (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in 

9. The Lord 

10. 
          

11. Where as the Angels which are greater both in power and might, giue not railing iudgement against them before the Lord.

12. 
          

13. And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings 

14. 
          

15. Which forsaking the right way, haue gone astray, folowing the way of Balaam, the sonne of Bosor, which loued the wages of vnrighteousnes.

16. But he was rebuked for his iniquitie: for the dumme beast speaking with mans voyce, forbade the foolishnesse of the Prophet.

17. 
          

18. For when they speak great 

19. Promising vnto them libertie, & are themselues the seruants of corruption: for of whomsoeuer a man is ouercome, euen vnto the same is he in bondage.

20. 
          

21. For it had bene better for them, not to haue acknowledged the way of righteousnes, then after they haue acknowledged it, to turne from the holy commaundement giuen vnto them.

22. But it is come vnto them, according to the true Prouerbe, The dogge is returned to his owne vomit: and, The sowe that was washed, to the wallowing in the myre.

## 2 Peter 3

1. This 

2. To call to remembrance the wordes, which were tolde before of the holy Prophetes, and also the commaundement of vs the Apostles of the Lord and Sauiour.

11. 
          

12. Looking for and 

13. Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, 

14. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in 

15. And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord [is] salvation; 

16. As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; 

17. Ye therefore beloued, seeing ye know these thinges before, beware, lest ye be also plucked away with the errour of the wicked, and fall from your owne stedfastnesse.

18. But growe in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ: to him be glory both now and for euermore. Amen.
