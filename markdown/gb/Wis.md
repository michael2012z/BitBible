1. {\cf2 In the twelfth yere of the reigne of Nabuchodonosor, who reigned in Nineue the great citie (in the dayes of Arphaxad, which reigned ouer the Medes in Ecbatane,}

2. {\cf2 And buylt in Ecbatane the walles round about, of hewen stone, three cubites broad, & sixe cubits long, & made the height of the wal seuetie cubits, & the bredth therof fiftie cubits,}

3. {\cf2 And made the towres thereof in the gates of it of an hundreth cubites, and the breadth thereof in the foundation three score cubites,}

4. {\cf2 And made the gates thereof, euen gates that were lifted vp on hie, seuentie cubites, & the bredth of the fourtie cubits, for ye going forth of his mightie armies, & for the setting in aray of his footeme)}

5. {\cf2 Euen in those dayes, King Nabuchodonosor made warre with King Arphaxad in the great field, which is the field in the coastes of Ragau.}

6. {\cf2 Then came vnto him all they that dwelt in the mountaines, & all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tygris & Hydaspes, & the countrey of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, & very many nations assembled theselues to the battel of ye sonnes of Chelod.}

7. {\cf2 And Nabuchodonosor King of the Assyrians sent vnto all that dwelt in Persia, & to all that dwelt in the West, and to those that dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus & Antilibanus, and to all that dwelt vpon the sea coast,}

8. {\cf2 And to the people that are in Carmel, and Galaad, and the hier Galile, and the great fielde of Esdrelam,}

9. {\cf2 And to all that were in Samaria, & the cities therof, & beyond Iorden vnto Ierusalem, & Betane, and Chellus, and Cades, & the riuer of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,}

10. {\cf2 Vnto one come to Tanis, and Memphis, and to all the inhabitantes of Egypt, and to one come to the mountaines of Ethiopia.}

11. {\cf2 But all the inhabitants of this countrey did not passe for the comandement of Nabuchodonosor King of the Assyrians, neither would they come with him to the battel: for they did not feare him: yea, he was before them as one man: therefore they sent away his ambassadours from them without effect, and with dishonour.}

12. {\cf2 Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry, with all this countrey, and sware by his throne and kingdome that he woulde surely be auenged vpon all those coastes of Cilicia & Damascus, & Syria, & that he woulde slay with the sworde all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Iudea, and all that were in Egypt, till one come to the borders of the two seas.}

13. {\cf2 Then hee marched in battell aray with his power against King Arphaxad in the seuenteenth yeere, & he preuailed in his battel: for he ouerthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, & all his chariots.}

14. {\cf2 And he wanne his cities, & came vnto Ecbatane, and tooke the towres, and spoyled the streetes thereof, and turned the beautie thereof into shame.}

15. {\cf2 He tooke also Arphaxad in the mountaines of Ragau, and smote him through with his dartes, and destroyed him vtterly that day.}

16. {\cf2 So he returned afterward to Nineue, both he and all his companie with a very great multitude of men of warre, and there he passed the time, and banketed, both he, and his armie an hundreth and twentie dayes.}

## Wisdom 2

1. {\cf2 And in the eighteenth yeere, the two and twentieth day of the first moneth, there was talke in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, that he should auenge himselfe on al ye earth, as he had spoken.}

2. {\cf2 So he called vnto him all his officers and al his nobles, and communicated with them his secrete counsell, and set before them with his owne mouth all the malice of the earth.}

3. {\cf2 Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that had not obeyed the commandement of his mouth.}

4. {\cf2 And when hee had ended his counsell, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians called Olofernes his chiefe captaine, and which was next vnto him, and sayde vnto him,}

5. {\cf2 Thus saith the great king, the Lorde of the whole earth, Behold, thou shalt goe forth from my presence, and take with thee men that trust in their owne strength, of footemen, an hundreth & twentie thousande, and the number of horses with their riders, twelue thousand,}

6. {\cf2 And thou shalt go against all the West countrey, because they disobeyed my commandement.}

7. {\cf2 And thou shalt declare vnto them, that they prepare for me the land and the water: for I wil goe forth in my wrath against them, and will couer the whole face of the earth with the feete of mine armie, and I will giue them as a spoyle vnto them,}

8. {\cf2 So that their wounded shall fill their valleyes, and their riuers, and the flood shall ouerflowe, being filled with their dead.}

9. {\cf2 And I will bring their captiuitie to the vtmost parts of all the earth.}

10. {\cf2 Thou therefore shalt depart hence, and take vp for me all their countrey: and if they yeeld vnto thee, thou shalt reserue them for mee vntill the day that I rebuke them.}

11. {\cf2 But concerning them that rebell, let not thine eye spare them, but put them to death, and spoyle them wheresoeuer thou goest.}

12. {\cf2 For as I liue, & the power of my kingdome, whatsoeuer I haue spoken, that will I doe by mine hande.}

13. {\cf2 And take thou heede that thou transgresse not any of the commandements of thy lorde, but accomplish them fully, as I haue commanded thee, and deferre not to do them.}

14. {\cf2 Then Olofernes went forth from the presence of his Lord, & called all the gouernours, and captaines, and officers of the armie of Assur,}

15. {\cf2 And he mustred the chosen men for the battel, as his Lord had commanded him, vnto an hundreth and twentie thousand, and twelue thousande archers on horsebacke.}

16. {\cf2 And he set the in aray according to the maner of setting a great armie in aray.}

17. {\cf2 And hee tooke camels & asses for their burdens, a very great number, and sheepe, and oxen, and goates without number for their prouision,}

18. {\cf2 And vitaile for euery man of the army, and very much gold and siluer out of the kings house.}

19. {\cf2 Then he went forth and all his power, to goe before in the viage of king Nabuchodonosor, & to couer all the face of the earth Westward, with their charets, and horsemen, and chosen footemen.}

20. {\cf2 A great multitude also of sundry sorts came with them like grashoppers, and like the grauell of the earth: for the multitude was without number.}

21. {\cf2 And they went forth of Nineue three dayes iourney toward the countrey of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth neere the mountaine which is at the left hand of the vpper Cilicia.}

22. {\cf2 Then hee tooke all his armie, his footemen and horsemen, and charets, and went from thence into the mountaines,}

23. {\cf2 And he destroied Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Ismael, which were toward the wildernesse at the South of the Chelians.}

24. {\cf2 Then hee went ouer Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and destroyed al the hie cities that were vpon the riuer of Arbonai, vntill one come to the sea.}

25. {\cf2 And he tooke the borders of Cilicia, and destroyed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Iapheth, which were toward the South and ouer against Arabia.}

26. {\cf2 He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burnt vp their tabernacles, and spoiled their lodges.}

27. {\cf2 Then hee went downe into the countrey of Damascus, in the time of wheate haruest, and burnt vp all their fieldes, and destroyed their flockes and the heards: he robbed their cities, and spoyled their countrey, and smote all their yong men with the edge of the sword.}

28. {\cf2 Therefore feare and trembling fell vpon all the inhabitants of the sea coast, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Iemnaan: and they that dwelt in Azotus, and Ascalon feared him greatly.}

## Wisdom 3

1. {\cf2 So they sent ambassadours to him with messages of peace, saying,}

2. {\cf2 Beholde, we are the seruants of Nabuchodonosor the great king: we lie downe before thee: vse vs as shalbe good in thy sight.}

3. {\cf2 Beholde, our houses and all our places, and all our fieldes of wheate, & our flocks, and our heards, and all our lodges and tabernacles lie before thy face: vse them as it pleaseth thee.}

4. {\cf2 Beholde, euen our cities and the inhabitantes therof are thy seruants come, and take them, as seemeth good to thee.}

5. {\cf2 So the men came to Olofernes, and declared vnto them after this maner.}

6. {\cf2 The came he downe toward ye sea coast, both he and his armie, and set garisons in the hie cities, and tooke out of them chosen men for the warre.}

7. {\cf2 So they and all the countrey round about receiued them, with crownes, with daunces, and with timbrels.}

8. {\cf2 Yet he brake downe all their borders, and cut downe their woods: for it was inioyned him to destroy al the gods of the land, that al nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, & that all tongues and tribes should call vpon him as God.}

9. {\cf2 Also he came against Esdr√¶lon, neere vnto Iudea, ouer against the great straite of Iudea,}

10. {\cf2 And he pitched betweene Geba, and a citie of ye Scythians, & there he taried a moneth, that he might assemble all the baggage of his armie.}

## Wisdom 4

1. {\cf2 Nowe the children of Israel that dwelt in Iudea, heard all that Olofernes ye chiefe captaine of Nabuchodonosor King of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and howe hee had spoyled all their temples, and brought them to nought.}

2. {\cf2 Therefore they feared greatly his presence, and were troubled for Ierusalem, and for the Temple of the Lord their God.}

3. {\cf2 For they were newly returned from the captiuitie, and of late all the people was assembled in Iudea, and the vessels and the altar of the house had bene sanctified because of the pollution.}

4. {\cf2 Therefore they sent into all the coastes of Samaria, and the villages, and to Bethoro, and Belmen, and Iericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem,}

5. {\cf2 And tooke all the toppes of the hie mountaines, and walled the villages that were in the, and put in vitailes for the prouision of warre: for their fieldes were of late reaped.}

6. {\cf2 Also Ioacim the hie Priest which was in those dayes in Ierusale, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia & Betomastham, which is ouer against Esdraelon toward the open countrey nere to Dothaim,}

7. {\cf2 Exhorting them to keepe the passages of the mountaines: for by them there was an entrie into Iudea, and it was easie to let them that woulde come vp, because ye passage was streit for two men at the most.}

8. {\cf2 And the children of Israel did as Ioacim ye hie Priest had commanded them with the Ancients of all the people of Israel, which dwelt at Ierusalem.}

9. {\cf2 Then cried euery man of Israel to God with great feruencie, and their soules with great affectio.}

10. {\cf2 Both they, and their wiues, and their children, and their cattell, and euery stranger, and hireling, and their bought seruantes put sackcloth vpon their loynes.}

11. {\cf2 Thus euery man and woman, and the children, and the inhabitantes of Ierusalem fell before the Temple, and sprinkled ashes vpon their heads, and spred out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,}

12. {\cf2 And cried to the God of Israel, all with one consent most earnestly, that hee woulde not giue their children for a pray, and their wiues for a spoile, and the cities of their inheritance to destructio, and the Sanctuarie to pollution and reproch, and vnto derision to the heathen.}

13. {\cf2 So God heard their prayers, and looked vpon their affliction: for the people fasted many dayes in al Iudea and Ierusalem before the Sanctuary of the Lord almightie.}

14. {\cf2 And Ioacim the high Priest, and all the Priests that stoode before the Lorde, and ministred vnto the Lord, had their loines girt with sackcloth, and offred the continuall burnt offring, with prayers and the free gifts of the people,}

15. {\cf2 And had ashes on their mytres, & cried vnto the Lord with all their power for grace, and that he would looke vpon all the house of Israel.}

## Wisdom 5

1. {\cf2 Then was it declared to Olofernes the chiefe captaine of the army of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for warre, and had shut the passages of the mountaines, and had walled all the toppes of the hie hilles, and had layd impediments in the champion countrey.}

2. {\cf2 Wherewith he was very angrie, and called all the princes of Moab, and the captaines of Ammon, and all the gouernours of the sea coast.}

3. {\cf2 And he sayd vnto the, Shewe me, O ye sonnes of Chanaan, Who is this people that dwelleth in the mountaines? And what are the cities that they inhabite? And what is the multitude of their armie? And wherein is their strength and their power? And what king or captaine is raised among them ouer their armie?}

4. {\cf2 And why haue they determined not to come to meete me, more then all the inhabitantes of the West?}

5. {\cf2 Then saide Achior the captaine of all the sonnes of Ammon, Let my lord heare ye word of the mouth of his seruant, and I will declare vnto thee ye trueth concerning this people, that dwell in these mountaines, neere where thou remainest: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy seruant.}

6. {\cf2 This people come of the stocke of the Chaldeans.}

7. {\cf2 And they dwelt before in Mesopotamia, because they would not followe the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea.}

8. {\cf2 But they went out of the way of their ancesters and worshipped the God of heauen, the God whom they knewe: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and soiourned there many dayes.}

9. {\cf2 Then their God commaunded them to depart from the place where they soiourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan, where they dwelt, and were increased with golde and siluer, and with very much cattell.}

10. {\cf2 But when a famine couered all the lande of Chanaan, they went downe into Egypt, and dwelt there till they returned, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their linage.}

11. {\cf2 Therfore the king of Egypt rose vp against them, and vsed deceite against them, and brought them lowe with labouring in bricke, and made them slaues.}

12. {\cf2 Then they cried vnto their God, & he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight.}

13. {\cf2 And God dried ye red sea in their presence,}

14. {\cf2 And brought them into mount Sina and Cades barne, and cast foorth all that dwelt in the wildernesse.}

15. {\cf2 So they dwelt in the lande of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength all them of Esebon, and passing ouer Iordan, they inherited all the mountaines.}

16. {\cf2 And they cast forth before them the Chanaanites, and the Pheresites, and the Iebusites, and them of Sichem, and all the Gergesites, and they dwelt in that countrey many dayes.}

17. {\cf2 And whiles they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hated iniquitie, was with them.}

18. {\cf2 But when they departed from the way which he appoynted them, they were destroyed in many battels after a wonderfull sort, and were led captiues into a land that was not theirs and the Temple of their God was cast to the grounde, and their cities were taken by the enemies.}

19. {\cf2 But nowe they are turned to their God, and are come vp from the scattering wherein they were scattered, and haue possessed Ierusalem, where their Temple is, and dwell in the mountaines which were desolate.}

20. {\cf2 Nowe therefore, my lorde and gouernour, ifthere be any fault in this people, so that they haue sinned against their God, let vs consider that this shall be their ruine, and let vs goe vp, and we shall ouercome them.}

21. {\cf2 But if there be none iniquitie in this people, let my lord passe by, least their Lord defende them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproche before all the worlde.}

22. {\cf2 And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people, standing round about the tent, murmured: and the chiefe men of Olofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side and in Moab, spake that he should kill him.}

23. {\cf2 For, say they, we feare not to meete the children of Israel: for loe, it is a people that haue no strength nor power against a mightie armie.}

24. {\cf2 Let vs therefore goe vp, O lorde Olofernes, and they shalbe meate for thy whole armie.}

## Wisdom 6

1. {\cf2 And when the tumult of the men that were about the councill, was ceased, Olofernes, the chiefe captaine of the armie of Assur, said vnto Achior before all the people of the strangers, and before all the children of Moab, and of them that were hyred of Ephraim,}

2. {\cf2 Because thou hast prophesied among vs to day, and hast sayde that the people of Ierusalem is able to fight, because their God will defende them: and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?}

3. {\cf2 He will send his power, and will destroy the from the face of the earth, and their God shall not deliuer them: but we his seruants will destroye them as one man: for they are not able to susteine the power of our horses.}

4. {\cf2 For we will treade them vnder feete with them, and their mountaines shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shalbe filled with their dead bodyes, and their footesteppes shall not be able to stand before vs: but they shall vtterly perish.}

5. {\cf2 The King Nabuchodonosor, lorde of all the earth, hath saide, euen he hath saide, None of my wordes shall be in vaine.}

6. {\cf2 And thou Achior an hireling of Ammon, because thou hast spoken these wordes in the day of thine iniquitie, thou shalt see my face no more from this day vntill I take vengeance of that people that is come out of Egypt.}

7. {\cf2 And then shall the yron of mine armie, and the multitude of them that serue me, passe through thy sides, and thou shalt fall among their slaine, when I shall put them to flight,}

8. {\cf2 And my seruants shall carrie thee into the mountaines, and they shall leaue thee at one of the hie cities: but thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them.}

9. {\cf2 And if thou perswade thy selfe in thy mind, that they shall not be taken, let not thy countenance fall: I haue spoken it, and none of my words shall be in vaine.}

10. {\cf2 Then commanded Olofernes them concerning Achior, that they shoulde bring him to Bethulia, and deliuer him into the handes of the children of Israel.}

11. {\cf2 So his seruants tooke him, and brought him out of the campe into the plaine: and they went out from the middest of the plaine into the mountaines, and came vnto the fountaines that were vnder Bethulia.}

12. {\cf2 And when the men of the citie saw them fro the top of the mountaine, they tooke their armour, and went foorth of the citie vnto the toppe of the moutaine, euen all the throwers with slings, & kept the from coming vp, by casting stones against the.}

13. {\cf2 But they went priuily vnder the hill, and bounde Achior, and left him lying at the foote of the hill, and returned to their lorde.}

14. {\cf2 Then the Israelites came downe from their citie, and stoode about him, and loosed him and brought him into Bethulia, and presented him to the gouernours of their citie,}

15. {\cf2 Which were in those dayes, Ozias the sonne of Micha, of ye tribe of Simeon, & Chabris ye sonne of Gothoniel, and Charmis the sonne of Melchiel.}

16. {\cf2 And they called together all the Auncients of the citie, and all their youth ranne together, and their women to the assemblie: and they set Achior in the middes of all their people. Then Ozias asked him of that which was done.}

17. {\cf2 And he answered and declared vnto them the wordes of the counsell of Olofernes, and all the wordes that he had spoken in the mids of the princes of Assur, and whatsoeuer Olofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel.}

18. {\cf2 Then the people fell downe and worshipped God, and cryed vnto God, saying,}

19. {\cf2 O Lord God of heauen, beholde their pride, and haue mercie on the basenesse of our people, and beholde this day the face of those that are sanctified vnto thee.}

20. {\cf2 Then they comforted Achior, and praysed him greatly.}

21. {\cf2 And Ozias tooke him out of ye asseblie into his house, & made a feast to the Elders, and they called on the God of Israel al that night for helpe.}

## Wisdom 7

1. {\cf2 The next day, Olofernes commaunded all his armie and all his people, which were come to take his part, that they should remoue their camps against Bethulia, and that they shoulde take all the streites of the hill, and to make warre against the children of Israel.}

2. {\cf2 Then their strong men remoued their camps in that day, and the armie of the men of warre was an hundreth thousand and seuentie footemen, and twelue thousande horsemen, beside the baggage & other men that were afoote among them, a very great multitude.}

3. {\cf2 And they camped in the plaine neere vnto Bethulia, by the fountaine, and they spred abroade towarde Dothaim vnto Belbaim, and in length from Bethulia vnto Ciamon, which is ouer against Esdraelom.}

4. {\cf2 Nowe the children of Israel, when they sawe the multitude, were greatly troubled, and said euery one to his neighbour, Nowe will they shut vp all the whole earth: for neither the hye mountaines nor the valleyes, nor the hilles are able to abide their burden.}

5. {\cf2 Then euery one tooke his weapons of warre, and burning fires in their towres, they remained and watched all that night.}

6. {\cf2 But in the seconde day, Olofernes brought foorth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel, which were in Bethulia,}

7. {\cf2 And viewed the passages vp to their citie, & came to the fountaines of their waters, and tooke them and set garrisons of men of warre ouer them, and remoued towarde his people.}

8. {\cf2 Then came vnto him all the chiefe of ye children of Esau, & all the gouernours of the people of Moab, and all the captaines of the sea coast, & said,}

9. {\cf2 Let our captaine nowe heare a worde, least an inconuenience come in thine armie.}

10. {\cf2 For this people of the children of Israel doe not trust in their speares, but in the height of the mountaines, wherein they dwell, because it is not easie to come vp to the tops of their mountaines.}

11. {\cf2 Nowe therefore, my lorde, fight not against them in battell aray, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.}

12. {\cf2 Remaine in thy campe, & keepe all the men of thine armie, and let thy men keepe still the water of the countrey, that commeth foorth at the foote of the mountaine.}

13. {\cf2 For al the inhabitants of Bethulia haue their water thereof: so shall thirst kill them, and they shall giue vp their citie: and we and our people wil goe vp to the toppes of the mountaines that are neere, and will campe vpon them, and watch that none goe out of the citie.}

14. {\cf2 So they and their wiues, and their children shalbe consumed with famine, & before the sworde come against them, they shall be ouerthrowen in the streetes where they dwell.}

15. {\cf2 Thus shalt thou render them an euil reward, because they rebelled and obeyed not thy person peaceably.}

16. {\cf2 And these wordes pleased Olofernes and all his souldiers, and he appointed to doe as they had spoken.}

17. {\cf2 So the campe of the children of Ammon departed, & with the fiue thousande of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, & tooke ye waters, & the fountaines of ye waters of the children of Israel.}

18. {\cf2 Then the children of Esau went vp with the children of Ammon, & camped in the mountaines ouer against Dothaim, and they sent some of them selues toward the South, and toward the East, ouer against Rebel, which is neere vnto Chusi, that is vpon the riuer Mochmur: and the rest of the armie of the Assyrians camped in the fielde, and couered the whole lande: for their tents and their baggage were pitched in a wonderfull great place.}

19. {\cf2 Then the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lorde their God, because their heart fayled: for all their enemies had compassed them about, and there was no waye to escape out from among them.}

20. {\cf2 Thus all the companie of Assur remained about them, both their footemen, chariots & horsemen, foure & thirtie dayes: so that euen all the places of their waters fayled all ye inhabitants of Bethulia.}

21. {\cf2 And the cisternes were emptie, and they had not water ynough to drinke for one day: for they gaue them to drinke by measure.}

22. {\cf2 Therefore their children swooned, and their wiues and yong men failed for thirst, & fell downe in the streetes of the citie, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no strength in them.}

23. {\cf2 Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chiefe of the citie, both yong men and women, and children, and cryed with a loude voyce, and said before all the Elders,}

24. {\cf2 The Lord iudge betweene vs and you: for you haue done vs great iniurie, in that ye haue not required peace of the children of Assur.}

25. {\cf2 For now we haue no helper: but God hath sold vs into their hands, that we should be throwen downe before them with thirst & great destructio.}

26. {\cf2 Nowe therefore call them together, and deliuer the whole citie for a spoyle to the people of Olofernes, and to all his armie.}

27. {\cf2 For it is better for vs to be made a spoyle vnto them, then to die for thirst: for we will bee his seruants that we may liue, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wiues, nor our children to die.}

28. {\cf2 We take to witnesse against you the heauen and the earth, and our God and Lorde of our fathers, which punisheth vs, according to our sinnes and the sinnes of our fathers, that he lay not these things to our charge.}

29. {\cf2 Then there was a great cry of all with one consent in the middes of the assemblie, and they cryed vnto the Lord God with a loude voyce.}

30. {\cf2 Then said Ozias to the, Brethren, be of good courage: let vs waite yet fiue dayes, in the which space the Lorde our God may turne his mercie towarde vs: for he will not forsake vs in the ende.}

31. {\cf2 And if these dayes passe, and there come not helpe vnto vs, I will doe according to your worde.}

32. {\cf2 So he separated the people, euery one vnto their charge, and they went vnto the walles and towers of their citie, and sent their wiues and their children into their houses, and they were very lowe brought in the citie.}

## Wisdom 8

1. {\cf2 Nowe at that time, Iudeth heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari the sonne of Ox, the sonne of Ioseph, the sonne of Oziel, the sonne of Elcia, the sonne of Ananias, the sonne of Gedeon, the sonne of Raphaim, the sonne of Acito, the sonne of Eliu, the sonne of Eliab, the sonne of Nathanael, the sonne of Samael, the sonne of Salasadai, the sonne of Israel.}

2. {\cf2 And Manasses was her husband, of her stocke and kinred, who dyed in the barley haruest.}

3. {\cf2 For as he was diligent ouer them that bound sheaues in the fielde, the heate came vpon his head, and he fell vpon his bed, and dyed in the citie of Bethulia, and they buryed him with his fathers in the fielde betweene Dothaim and Balamo.}

4. {\cf2 So Iudeth was in her house a widowe three yeeres and foure moneths.}

5. {\cf2 And she made her a tent vpon her house, and put on sackecloth on her loynes, and ware her widowes apparell.}

6. {\cf2 And she fasted all the dayes of her widowhood, saue the day before the Sabbath & the Sabbaths, and the day before the newe moones, and in the feastes & solemne dayes of the house of Israel.}

7. {\cf2 She was also of a goodly countenance and very beautifull to beholde: and her husbande Manasses had left her golde and siluer, and men seruants, and maide seruants, and cattell, and possessions, where she remained.}

8. {\cf2 And there was none that coulde bring an euill report of her: for she feared God greatly.}

9. {\cf2 Now when she heard the euil wordes of the people against the gouernour, because they faintedfor lacke of waters (for Iudeth had hearde all the wordes that Ozias had spoken vnto them, and that hee had sworne vnto them to deliuer the citie vnto the Assyrians within fiue dayes)}

10. {\cf2 Then she sent her maide, that had the gouernement of all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmisthe Ancients of the citie.}

11. {\cf2 And they came vnto her, and she sayde vnto them, Heare me, O ye gouernors of the inhabitantes of Bethulia: for your words that ye haue spoken before the people this day, are not right, touching this othe which yee made and pronounced betweene God and you, and haue promised to deliuer the citie to the enemies, vnlesse within these dayes the Lord turne to helpe you.}

12. {\cf2 And nowe who are you that haue tempted God this day, & set your selues in the place of God among the children of men?}

13. {\cf2 So now you seeke the Lorde almightie, but you shall neuer know any thing.}

14. {\cf2 For you cannot finde out the depth of the heart of man, neither can yee perceiue the thinges that hee thinketh: then howe can you search out God, that hath made all these things, and knowe his minde, or comprehende his purpose? Nay my brethren, prouoke not the Lord our God to anger.}

15. {\cf2 For if he will not helpe vs within these fiue dayes, he hath power to defend vs whe he will, euen euery day, or to destroy vs before our enemies.}

16. {\cf2 Doe not you therefore binde the counsels of the Lord our God: For God is not as man that he may be threatned, neither as the sonne of man to be brought to iudgement.}

17. {\cf2 Therefore let vs wayte for saluation of him and call vpon him to helpe vs, and hee will heare our voice if it please him.}

18. {\cf2 For there appeareth none in our age, neither is there any nowe in these dayes, neither tribe, nor familie, nor people, nor citie among vs, which worship ye gods made with hands, as hath bene aforetime.}

19. {\cf2 For the which cause our fathers were giuen to the sworde, and for a spoyle, and had a great fall before our enemies.}

20. {\cf2 But we know none other God: therefore we trust that he will not despise vs, nor any of our linage.}

21. {\cf2 Neither when we shalbe taken, shal Iudea be so famous: for our Sanctuarie shalbe spoyled, & he will require the prophanation therof at our mouth,}

22. {\cf2 And the feare of our brethren, and the captiuitie of the countrey, and the desolation of our inheritance will he turne vpon our heades among the Gentiles, wheresoeuer we shalbe in bondage, & we shall be an offence and a reproche to all them that possesse vs.}

23. {\cf2 For our seruitude shall not be directed by fauour, but ye Lord our God shal turne it to dishonour.}

24. {\cf2 Now therefore, O brethren, let vs shew an example to our brethren, because their heartes depend vpon vs, and the Sanctuarie, and the House, and the altar rest vpon vs.}

25. {\cf2 Moreouer, let vs giue thankes to ye Lord our God, which tryeth vs euen as hee did our fathers.}

26. {\cf2 Remember what things he did to Abraha, and how he tryed Isaac, & al that he did to Iacob in Mesopotamia of Syria when he kept the sheepe of Laban his mothers brother.}

27. {\cf2 For hee hath not tried vs as he did them to the examination of their heartes, neither doth hee take vengeance on vs, but the Lorde punisheth for instruction them that come neere to him.}

28. {\cf2 Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken, hast thou spoken with a good heart, and there is none that is able to resist thy words.}

29. {\cf2 For it is not to day that thy wisedome is knowen, but from the beginning of thy life all the people haue knowen thy wisedome: for the deuice of thine heart is good.}

30. {\cf2 But the people were very thirstie, and compelled vs to do vnto the, as we haue spoken, & haue brought vs to an oth which we may not transgresse.}

31. {\cf2 Therefore now pray for vs, because thou art an holy woman, that the Lord may send vs raine to fill our cisternes, and that we may faint no more.}

32. {\cf2 Then sayd Iudeth vnto them, Heare mee, & I will doe a thing, which shall bee declared in all generations, to the children of our nation.}

33. {\cf2 You shal stand this night in the gate, & I wil go forth with mine handmaide: & within ye dayes that ye haue promised to deliuer the citie to our enemies, the Lord wil visite Israel by mine hand.}

34. {\cf2 But inquire not you of mine acte: for I will not declare it vnto you, till the things be finished that I doe.}

35. {\cf2 Then saide Ozias and the princes vnto her, Goe in peace, and the Lorde God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.}

36. {\cf2 So they returned from the tent, and went to their wardes.}

## Wisdom 9

1. {\cf2 Then Iudeth fell vpon her face, and put ashes vpon her head, and put off the sackcloth wherwith she was clothed; about the time that the incense of that euening was offred in Ierusalem in the house of the Lorde, Iudeth cryed with a loude voyce, and saide,}

2. {\cf2 O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gauest a sworde to take vengeance of ye strangers which opened the wombe of the maide, and defiled her, and discouered the thigh with shame, & polluted the wombe to reproche (for thou haddest commanded that it should not so be,}

3. {\cf2 Yet they did things for the which thou gauest their princes to the slaughter, for they were deceiued and washed their beds with bloud) and hast striken the seruants with the gouerners, and the gouerners vpon their thrones,}

4. {\cf2 And hast giuen their wiues for a pray & their daughters to be captiues, and all their spoyles for a bootie to the children that thou louedst: which were mooued with thy zeale, & abhorred the pollution of their bloud, & called vpon thee for ayde, O God, O my God, heare me also a widdowe.}

5. {\cf2 For thou hast wrought the things afore, and these, and the things that shalbe after, and thou considerest the things that are present, and the things that are to come.}

6. {\cf2 For the things which thou doest purpose, are present, and say, Beholde, wee are here: for all thy wayes are readie, and thy iudgements are foreknowen.}

7. {\cf2 Behold, the Assyrians are multyplied by their power: they haue exalted them selues with horses and horsemen: they glory in the strength of their footemen: they trust in shield, speare and bow, and sling, and do not know that thou art the Lord that breakest the battels: the Lord is thy Name.}

8. {\cf2 Breake thou their strength by thy power, and breake their force by thy wrath: for they haue purposed to defile thy Sanctuarie, and to pollute the Tabernacle where thy glorious Name resteth, and to cast downe with weapons the hornes of the Altar.}

9. {\cf2 Behold their pride, and send thy wrath vpon their heads: giue into mine hand which am a widow, the strength that I haue conceiued.}

10. {\cf2 Smite by the deceite of my lippes the seruant with the prince, and the prince with the seruant: abate their height by the hand of a woman.}

11. {\cf2 For thy power standeth not in the multitude, nor thy might in strong men: but thou, O Lorde, art the helpe of the humble and little ones, the defender of the weake, and the protector of them that are forsaken, and the Sauiour of them that are without hope.}

12. {\cf2 Surely, surely thou art the God of my father, and the God of the inheritance of Israel, the Lorde of heauen and earth, the creator of the waters, the King of all creatures: heare thou my prayer,}

13. {\cf2 And graunt me words and craft, & a wound, & a stroke against the that enterprise cruel things against thy couenat, and against thine holy House, and against the toppe of Sion, & against the house of the possession of thy children.}

1. {\cf2 Nowe after she had ceased to cry vnto the God of Israel, and had made an ende of all these wordes,}

2. {\cf2 She rose where she had fallen down, & called her maide, and went downe into the house, in the which she abode in the Sabbath dayes and in the feast dayes,}

3. {\cf2 And putting away the sackecloth wherewith she was clad, and putting off the garmentes of her widowhode, shee washed her bodie with water, and anointed it with much oyntment, and dressed the heare of her head, and put attire vpon it, and put on her garments of gladnesse, wherewith shee was clad during the life of Manasses her husbande.}

4. {\cf2 And she put slippers on her feete, and put on bracelets, and sleeues, and rings, and earinges, and all her ornaments, and she decked her selfe brauely to allure the eyes of all men that should see her.}

5. {\cf2 Then she gaue her maide a bottel of wine, & a potte of oyle, and filled a scrip with floure, & with drie figges, and with fine bread: so she lapped vp all these thinges together and layde them vpon her.}

6. {\cf2 Thus they went forth to the gate of the citie of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias, and the Ancients of the citie, Chabris and Charmis.}

7. {\cf2 And when they sawe her that her face was changed, and that her garment was changed, they marueyled greaely at her wonderfull beautie, and sayde vnto her,}

8. {\cf2 The God, the God of our fathers giue thee fauour, and accomplish thine enterprises to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Ierusalem. Then they worshipped God.}

9. {\cf2 And she said vnto them, Command the gates of the citie to be opened vnto me, that I may goe forth to accomplish the things which you haue spoken to me. So they commanded the yong men to open vnto her, as she had spoken.}

10. {\cf2 And when they had done so, Iudeth went out, she and her maide with her, & the men of the citie looked after her, vntill shee was gone downe the mountaine, and till she had passed the valley, & could see her no more.}

11. {\cf2 Thus they went streight forth in the valley, and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,}

12. {\cf2 And tooke her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence commest thou? and whither goest thou? And shee saide, I am a woman of the Hebrewes, and am fledde from them: for they shall be giuen you to be consumed.}

13. {\cf2 And I come before Olophernes, the chiefe captaine of your armie, to declare him true things, and I will shew before him the way whereby hee shall goe and win al the mountaines, without losing the bodie or life of anie of his men.}

14. {\cf2 Now when the men heard her wordes, and behelde her countenance, they wondred greatly at her beautie, and sayd vnto her,}

15. {\cf2 Thou hast saued thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come downe to the presence of our lorde nowe therefore come to his tent, and some of vs shall conduct thee vntill they haue deliuered thee into his hands.}

16. {\cf2 And when thou standest before him, be not afraide in thine heart, but shew vnto him according as thou hast to say, and hee will intreate thee well.}

17. {\cf2 Then they chose out of them an hundreth men, and prepared a charet for her and her maide, and brought her to the tent of Olophernes.}

18. {\cf2 Then there was a running to and fro, through out the campe: for her comming was bruted amog the tentes: and they came and stoode round about her: for she stood without the tent of Olophernes vntil they had declared vnto him concerning her.}

19. {\cf2 And they marueiled at her beautie, and wondred at the children of Israel because of her, and euery one sayde vnto his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that haue among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left: for if they shoulde remaine, they might deceiue the whole earth.}

20. {\cf2 Then Olophernes garde went out, and all his seruants, and they brought her into the tent.}

21. {\cf2 Now Olophernes rested vpon his bed vnder a conopie, which was wouen with purple and golde and emeraudes, and precious stones.}

22. {\cf2 So they shewed him of her, & he came forth vnto the entrie of his tent, and they caryed lampes of siluer before him.}

23. {\cf2 And when Iudeth was come before him and his seruantes, they all marueyled at the beautie of her countenance, and she fel downe vpon her face, and did reuerence vnto him, and his seruants tooke her vp.}

## Wisdom 11

1. {\cf2 Then sayd Olophernes vnto her, Woman, bee of good comfort: feare not in thine heart: for I neuer hurt any that would serue Nabuchodonosor the King of all the earth.}

2. {\cf2 Now therefore if thy people that dwelleth in the mountaines, had not despysed me, I would not haue lifted vp my speare against them: but they haue procured these things to themselues.}

3. {\cf2 But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and art come vnto vs: for thou art come for sauegard: bee of good comfort, thou shalt liuefrom this night, and hereafter.}

4. {\cf2 For none shall hurt thee, but intreate thee well, as they doe the seruants of King Nabuchodonosor my lorde.}

5. {\cf2 Then Iudeth saide vnto him, Receiue the wordes of thy seruant, and suffer thine handmaide to speake in thy presence, and I will declare no lye to my lorde this night.}

6. {\cf2 And if thou wilt followe the wordes of thine handmaid, God wil bring ye thing perfectly to passe by thee, and my lorde shall not faile of his purpose.}

7. {\cf2 As Nabuchodonosor King of all the earth liueth, and as his power is of force, who hath sent thee to reforme all persons, not onely men shalbe made subiect to him by thee, but also the beastes of the fieldes, and the cattel, and the foules of the heauen shall liue by thy power vnder Nabuchodonosor and all his house.}

8. {\cf2 For we haue heard of thy wisedome and of thy prudent spirite, and it is declared through the whole earth, that thou onely art excellent in all the kingdome, and of a wonderfull knowledge, and in feates of warre marueilous.}

9. {\cf2 Nowe as concerning the matter which Achier did speake in thy councill, we haue heard his wordes: for the men of Bethulia did take him, and he declared vnto them all that he had spoken vnto thee.}

10. {\cf2 Therefore, O lord and gouernour, reiect not his worde, but set it in thine heart, for it is true: for there is no punishment against our people, neither can the sworde preuaile against them, except they sinne against their God.}

11. {\cf2 Nowe therefore, least my lorde shoulde be frustrate, and voyde of his purpose, and that death may fall vpon them, and that they may be taken in their sinne whiles they prouoke their God to anger, which is so oft times as they doe that which is not beseeming,}

12. {\cf2 (For because their vitailes fayle, and all their water is wasted, they haue determined to take their cattell, and haue purposed to consume all things that God had forbidden them to eate by his Lawes:}

13. {\cf2 Yea, they haue purposed to consume the first fruits of the wheat, and the tithes of the wine, & of the oyle which they had reserued and sanctified for the Priestes that serue in Ierusalem before the face of our God: the which things it is not lawfull for any of the people to touch with their handes.}

14. {\cf2 Moreouer, they haue sent to Ierusalem, because they also that dwel there, haue done the like, such as should bring them licence from ye Senate)}

15. {\cf2 Nowe when they shall bring them worde, they will doe it, and they shall be giuen thee to be destroyed the same day.}

16. {\cf2 Wherefore I thine handmaide, knowing all this, am fledde from their presence, and God hath sent me to worke a thing with thee, whereof all the earth shall wonder, and whosoeuer shall heare it.}

17. {\cf2 For thy seruant feareth God, and worshippeth the God of heauen day and night, and nowe let me remaine with thee, my lord, and let thy seruant go out in the night into the valley, and I will pray vnto God, that he may reueile vnto me when they shall commit their sinnes,}

18. {\cf2 And I wil come and shew it vnto thee: then thou shalt goe foorth with all thine armie, and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee.}

19. {\cf2 And I will leade thee through the middes of Iudea, vntill thou come before Ierusalem, and I will set thy throne in the middes thereof, and thou shalt driue them as sheepe that haue no shepherd, and a dogge shall not barke with his mouth against thee: for these things haue bene spoken vnto me, and declared vnto me according to my foreknowledge, and I am sent to shewe thee.}

20. {\cf2 Then her wordes pleased Olofernes, and all his seruants, and they marueiled at her wisedom, and sayde,}

21. {\cf2 There is not such a woman in all the world, both for beautie of face, and wisedome of wordes.}

22. {\cf2 Likewise Olofernes said vnto her, God hath done this, to sende thee before the people, that strength might be in our handes, and destruction vpon them that despise my lorde.}

23. {\cf2 And nowe thou art both beautifull in thy countenance, and wittie in thy wordes: surely if thou doe as thou hast spoken, thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of Nabuchodonosor, and shalt be renoumed throughout the whole earth.}

1. {\cf2 Then he commanded to bring her in where his treasures were layd, and bade that they should prepare for her of his owne meates, and that she should drinke of his owne wine.}

2. {\cf2 But Iudeth saide, I may not eate of them, least there should be an offence, but I can suffice my selfe with the things that I haue brought.}

3. {\cf2 Then Olofernes said vnto her, If the things that thou hast, should faile, howe should we giue thee the like? for there is none with vs of thy nation.}

4. {\cf2 Then said Iudeth vnto him, As thy soule liueth, my lorde, thine handmaide shall not spende those things that I haue, before the Lorde worke by mine hand the things that he hath determined.}

5. {\cf2 Then the seruants of Olofernes brought her into the tent, and she slept vntill midnight, and rose at the morning watch,}

6. {\cf2 And sent to Olofernes, saying, Let my lorde commaunde that thine handmaide may goe foorth vnto prayer.}

7. {\cf2 Then Olofernes commanded his garde that they shoulde not stay her: thus she abode in the campe three dayes, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed her selfe in a fountaine, euen in the water by the campe.}

8. {\cf2 And when she came out, she prayed vnto the Lord God of Israel, that he woulde direct her way to the exaltation of the children of her people.}

9. {\cf2 So she returned, and remained pure in the tent, vntill she ate her meate at euening.}

10. {\cf2 And in the fourth day, Olofernes made a feast to his owne seruants only, and called none of them to the banket, that had the affaires in hande.}

11. {\cf2 Then saide he to Bagoas the eunuche who had charge ouer all that he had, Goe and perswade this Hebrewe woman, which is with thee, that she come vnto vs, and eate and drinke with vs.}

12. {\cf2 For it were a shame for vs, if we shoulde let such a woman alone, and not talke with her, and if we doe not allure her, she will mocke vs.}

13. {\cf2 Then went Bagoas from the presence of Olofernes, and came to her, and saide, Let not this faire maide make difficultie to goe in to my lord, and to be honoured in his presence, and to drinke wine with vs ioyfully, and to be entreated as one of the daughters of the children of Assur, which remaine in the house of Nabuchodonosor.}

14. {\cf2 The said Iudeth vnto him, Who am I now, that I should gainesay my lord? Surely whatsoeuer pleaseth him, I will doe speedily, and it shall be my ioy vnto the day of my death.}

15. {\cf2 So she arose & trimmed her with garments, and with all the ornaments of women, & her maid went, and spred foorth her skinnes on the grounde ouer against Olofernes, which she had receiued of Bagoas for her daily vse, that she might sit and eate vpon them.}

16. {\cf2 Nowe when Iudeth came and sate downe, Olofernes heart was rauished with her, and his spirite was moued, and he desired greatly her company: for he had waited for the time to deceiue her from the day that he had seene her.}

17. {\cf2 Then said Olofernes vnto her, Drinke now, and be merry with vs.}

18. {\cf2 So Iudeth said, I drinke nowe, my lorde, because my state is exalted this day more then euer it was since I was borne.}

19. {\cf2 Then she tooke, and ate and dranke before him the things, that her maide had prepared.}

20. {\cf2 And Olofernes reioyced because of her, and dranke much more wine then hee had drunken at any time in one day since he was borne.}

## Wisdom 13

1. {\cf2 Now when the euening was come, his seruants made haste to depart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed those that were present, from the presence of his lorde, and they went to their beddes: for they were all weary, because the feast had bene long.}

2. {\cf2 And Iudeth was left alone in the tent, and Olofernes was stretched along vpon his bed: for he was filled with wine.}

3. {\cf2 Nowe Iudeth had commanded her maide to stande without her chamber, and to waite for her comming foorth as she did daily: for she saide, she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoas according to the same purpose.}

4. {\cf2 So all went foorth of her presence, and none was left in the chamber, neither litle nor great: then Iudeth standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lorde God of all power, beholde at this present the workes of mine handes for the exaltation of Ierusalem.}

5. {\cf2 For nowe is the time to helpe thine inheritance, and to execute mine enterprises, to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against vs.}

6. {\cf2 Then she came to the post of the bed which was at Olofernes head, and tooke downe his fauchin from thence,}

7. {\cf2 And approched to the bed, and tooke holde of the heare of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel this day.}

8. {\cf2 And she smote twise vpon his necke with al her might, and she tooke away his head from him,}

9. {\cf2 And rolled his bodie downe from the bed, and pulled downe the canopie from the pillars, and anon after she went foorth, and gaue Olofernes head to her maide,}

10. {\cf2 And she put it in her scrippe of meate: so they twaine went together according to their custome vnto praier, and preassing through the tents, went about by that valley, & went vp to the moutaine of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.}

11. {\cf2 Then said Iudeth afarre off to the watchmen at the gates, Open nowe the gate: God, euen our God is with vs to shewe his power yet in Ierusalem, and his force against his enemies, as he hath euen done this day.}

12. {\cf2 Nowe when the men of her citie heard her voyce, they made haste to goe downe to the gate of their citie, and they called the Elders of the city.}

13. {\cf2 And they ranne all together both small and great: for it was aboue their expectation, that she shoulde come. So they opened the gate and receiued her, and made a fire for a light, and stood roud about them twaine.}

14. {\cf2 Then she said to them with a loude voyce, Praise God, praise God: for he hath not taken away his mercie from the house of Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.}

15. {\cf2 So she tooke the head out of the scrippe and shewed it, and said vnto them, Beholde the head of Olofernes, the chiefe captaine of the armie of Assur, and beholde the canopie, wherein he did lye in his drunkennes, and the Lord hath smitteth him by the hande of a woman.}

16. {\cf2 As the Lorde liueth, who hath kept me in my way that I went, my countenance hath deceiued him to his destruction, and he hath not committed sinne with me by any pollution or villenie.}

17. {\cf2 Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowed them selues, and worshipped God, and said with one accorde, Blessed be thou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies of thy people.}

18. {\cf2 Then said Ozias vnto her, O daughter, blessed art thou of the most hie God aboue al the women of the earth, and blessed be the Lorde God, which hath created the heauens and the earth, which hath directed thee to the cutting off of the head of the chiefe of our enemies.}

19. {\cf2 Surely this thine hope shall neuer departe out of the heartes of men: for they shall remember the power of God for euer.}

20. {\cf2 And God turne these things to thee for a perpetuall praise, and visite thee with good things, because thou hast not spared thy life, because of the affliction of our nation, but thou hast holpen our ruine, walking a straight way before our God; all the people said, So be it, so be it.}

## Wisdom 14

2. {\cf2 And so soone as the morning shall appeare and the sunne shall come foorth vpon the earth, take you euery one his weapons, and goe foorth euery valiant man out of the citie, & set you a captaine ouer them, as though you woulde goe downe into the fielde, towarde the watch of the Assyrians, but goe not downe.}

3. {\cf2 Then they shall take their armour, and shall goe into their campe, and rayse vp the captaines of the armie of Assur, and they shall runne to the tent of Olofernes, but shall not finde him: then feare shall fall vpon them, and they shall flee beforeyour face.}

4. {\cf2 So you & all that inhabite the coastes of Israel, shal pursue them, & ouerthrow them as they go.}

5. {\cf2 But before you doe these things, call mee Achior the Ammonite, that hee may see, and knowe him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to vs as to death.}

6. {\cf2 Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias, and when hee was come and sawe the head of Olofernes in a certaine mans hand in the assemblie of the people, hee fell downe on his face, and his spirit failed.}

8. {\cf2 Now therefore tell mee all the thinges, that thou hast done in these dayes. Then Iudeth declared vnto him in the middes of the people all that shee had done from the daye that shee went forth, vntill that houre shee spake vnto them.}

9. {\cf2 And when she had left of speaking, the people reioyced with a great voyce, and made a noyse of gladnesse through their citie.}

12. {\cf2 But when the Assyrians sawe them, they sent to their captaines, which went to the gouernours and chiefe captaines, and to all their rulers.}

13. {\cf2 So they came to Olofernes tent and saide to him that had the charge of all his things, Waken our lord: for the slaues haue bene bolde to come downe against vs to battel, that they may bee destroyed for euer.}

14. {\cf2 Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the doore of the tent: for hee thought that hee had slept with Iudeth.}

15. {\cf2 But because none answered, hee opened it, and went into the chamber, and founde him cast vpon the floore, and his head was taken from him.}

16. {\cf2 Therefore he cryed with a loude voyce, with weeping and mourning, and a mightie cry, and rent his garments.}

3. {\cf2 They also that had camped in the mountaines rounde about Bethulia, were put to flight: then the children of Israel, euery one that was a warriour among them, rushed out vpon them.}

4. {\cf2 Then sent Ozias to Bethomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Chola and to al the coastes of Israel, such as shoulde declare vnto them the things that were done, and that all shoulde rushe forth vpon their enemies to destroy them.}

5. {\cf2 Nowe when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell vpon them together vnto Choba: likewise also they that came from Ierusalem and from all the mountaines: for men had tolde them what things were done in the campe of their enemies, & they that were in Galaad and in Galile chased them with a great slaughter vntill they came to Damascus and to the coastes thereof.}

6. {\cf2 And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell vpon the campe of Assur and spoyled them, and were greatly enriched.}

7. {\cf2 And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter, had the rest: and the villages and the cities that were in the mountaines and in the plaine, had a great bootie: for the abundance was very great.}

8. {\cf2 Then Ioacim the hie Priest, and the Ancients of the children of Israel that dwelt in Ierusalem, came to confirme the benefites that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Iudeth, and to salute her.}

9. {\cf2 And when they came vnto her, they blessed her with one accord, and saide vnto her, Thou art the exaltation of Ierusalem: thou art the great glorie of Israel: thou art the great reioycing of our nation.}

10. {\cf2 Thou hast done all these thinges by thine hande: thou hast done much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed bee thou of the almightie Lorde for euermore: and all the people said, So be it.}

11. {\cf2 And the people spoyled the campe the space of thirtie dayes, and they gaue vnto Iudeth Olofernes tent, and all his siluer and beds, and basins, and all his stuffe, and she tooke it and laid it on her mules, and made readie her charets, & laied them thereon.}

12. {\cf2 Then all the women of Israel came together to see her, & blessed her, & made a daunce among them for her, and she tooke braunches in her hand, and gaue also to the women that were with her.}

13. {\cf2 They also crowned her with oliues, and her that was with her, and shee went before the people in the daunce, leading al the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour, with crownes, and with songs in their mouthes.}

## Wisdom 16

1. {\cf2 Then Iudeth began this confession in all Israel, and all the people sang this songe with a loude voyce.}

2. {\cf2 And Iudeth saide, Beginne vnto my GOD with tymbrels: sing to my Lorde with cymbals: tune vnto him a psalme: exalt his prayse, and call vpon his Name.}

3. {\cf2 For God breaketh the battels, and pitched his campe in the middes of the people, and deliuered me out of the hande of the persecuters.}

4. {\cf2 Assur came from the mountaines forth of the North: hee came with thousandes in his armie, whose multitude hath shut vp the riuers and their horsemen haue couered the valleis.}

5. {\cf2 He said that he would burne vp my borders and kill my yong men with the sworde, and dash the sucking children against the ground, and make mine infantes as a pray, and my virgins a spoyle.}

6. {\cf2 But the almightie Lorde hath brought them to nought by the hand of a woman.}

7. {\cf2 For the mightie did not fal by the yong men, neither did the sonnes of Titan smite him, nor the hie giants inuade him, but Iudeth the daughter of Merari did discomfite him by the beautie of her countenance.}

8. {\cf2 For shee put off the garment of her widowhoode, for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with oyntment, and bound vp her heare in a coife, and tooke a linnen garment to deceiue him.}

9. {\cf2 Her slippers rauished his eyes: her beautie tooke his minde prisoner, and the fauchin passed through his necke.}

10. {\cf2 The Persians were astonished at her boldenes, & the Medes were troubled with her hardines.}

11. {\cf2 But mine afflicted reioyced, and my feeble ones showted: then they feared, they lifted vp their voyce and turned backe.}

12. {\cf2 The children of maides perced them, and wounded them as they fledde away like children: they perished by the battel of the Lord.}

13. {\cf2 I will sing vnto the Lorde a song and praise, O Lord, thou art great and glorious, marueilous & inuincible in power.}

14. {\cf2 Let all thy creatures serue thee: for thou hast spoken and they were made: thou hast sent thy Spirit, and he made them vp: and there is none that can resist thy voyce.}

15. {\cf2 For the mountaines leape vp from their foudations with the waters: the rockes melte at thy presence like waxe: yet thou art mercifull to them that feare thee.}

16. {\cf2 For al sacrifice is to litle for a sweet savour, and al the fatte is to litle for thy burnt offring: but hee that feareth the Lorde, is great at all times.}

17. {\cf2 Woe to the nations that rise vp against my kinred: the Lorde almightie will take vengeance of them in the day of iudgement, in sending fire & wormes vpon their flesh, and they shall feele them and weepe for euer.}

18. {\cf2 After, when they wet vnto Ierusalem, they worshipped the Lorde, and assoone as the people were purified, they offred their burnt offrings, and their free offringes, and their giftes.}

19. {\cf2 Iudeth also offred all the stuffe of Olofernes, which the people had giuen her, and gaue the canopie which she had taken off his bed, for an oblation to the Lord.}

20. {\cf2 So the people reioyced in Ierusalem by the Sanctuarie, for the space of three moneths, and Iudeth remained with them.}

21. {\cf2 After this time, euery one returned to his owne inheritance, and Iudeth went to Bethulia, and remayned in her owne possession, and was for her time honourable in all the countrey.}

22. {\cf2 And many desired her, but none had her companie all the dayes of her life after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his people.}

23. {\cf2 But shee increased more and more in honour, and waxed olde in her husbandes house, beeing an hundreth and fiue yeere olde, and made her maide free: so shee dyed in Bethulia, and they buried her in the graue of her husband Manasses.}

24. {\cf2 And the house of Israel lamented her seuen dayes, and before shee dyed, shee did distribute her goods to all them that were neerest of kinred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the neerest of her kinred.}

25. {\cf2 And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afrayde in the dayes of Iudeth, nor a long time after her death.}
