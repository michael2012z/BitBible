31. {\cf2 (13:32)} But the men, that went vp with him, saide, we be not able to goe vp against the people: for they are stronger then we.

3. And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be

5. Then Moses and Aaron

8. If the Lorde loue vs, he will bring vs into this land, and giue it vs, which is a land that floweth with milke and honie.

9. Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are]

12. I will smite them with the pestilence and destroy them, and will make thee a greater nation and mightier then they.

13. But Moses saide vnto the Lorde, When the Egyptians shall heare it, (for thou broughtest this people by thy power from among them)

14. Then they shall say to the inhabitants of this land, (for they haue heard that thou, Lorde, art among this people, and that thou, Lorde, art seene face to face, and that thy cloude standeth ouer them, and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloude, and in a pillar of fire by night)

15. Now [if] thou shalt kill [all] this people as 

16. Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the lande, which he sware vnto them, therefore hath he slaine them in the wildernesse.

17. And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lorde be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,

18. The Lord is slowe to anger, and of great mercie, and forgiuing iniquitie, and sinne, but not making the wicked innocent, and visiting the wickednes of the fathers vpon the children, in the thirde and fourth generation:

19. Be mercifull, I beseech thee, vnto the iniquitie of this people, according to thy great mercie, and as thou hast forgiuen this people from Egypt, euen vntill nowe.

20. And the LORD said, I have pardoned 

21. Notwithstanding, as I liue, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.

22. Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these

27. How long shall I suffer this wicked multitude to murmure against me? I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmure against me.

28. Tell them, As I liue (saith the Lorde) I wil surely do vnto you, euen as ye haue spoken in mine eares.

29. Your carkeises shall fall in this wildernes, and all you that were counted through all your nombers, from twentie yeere olde and aboue, which haue murmured against me,

30. Ye shall not doubtles come into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande, to make you dwell therein, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun.

31. But your children, (which ye said shoulde be a pray) them will I bring in, and they shall knowe the lande which ye haue refused:

37. Euen those men that did bring vp that vile slander vpon the land, shall die by a plague before the Lorde.

38. But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, of those men that went to search the land, shall liue.

39. Then Moses tolde these sayings vnto all the children of Israel, and the people sorowed greatly.

40. And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here], and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have

42. Goe not vp (for the Lorde is not among you) lest ye be ouerthrowe before your enemies.

16. One Lawe and one maner shall serue both for you and for the stranger that soiourneth with you.

26. Then it shalbe forgiuen all the Congregation of the children of Israel, & the stranger that dwelleth among them: for all the people were in ignorance.

29. He that is borne among the children of Israel, and the stranger that dwelleth among them, shall haue both one lawe, who so doth sinne by ignorance.

30. But the person that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be borne in the land, or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord: therefore that person shalbe cut off from among his people,

8. Againe Moses saide vnto Korah, Heare, I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui.

9. Seemeth it a smal thing vnto you that the God of Israel hath separated you from the multitude of Israel, to take you neere to himselfe, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, & to stand before the Congregation and to minister vnto them?

10. And he hath brought thee near [to

22. And they fell vpon their faces and saide, O God the God of the spirits, of all fleshe, hath not one man onely sinned, and wilt thou bee wroth with all the Congregation?

23. And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,

24. Speake vnto the Congregation & say, Get you away from about the Tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.

25. Then Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram, and the Elders of Israel followed him.

26. And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed 

27. So they gate them away from the Tabernacle of Korah, Dathan and Abiram on euerie side: and Dathan, and Abiram came out & stood in the doore of their tentes with their wiues, and their sonnes, and their little children.

28. And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of mine own

33. So they and all that they had, went down aliue into the pit, and the earth couered them: so they perished from among the Congregation.

34. And all Israel that were about them, fled at the crie of them: for they said, Let vs flee, least the earth swalow vs vp.

35. But there came out a fire from the Lorde, and consumed the two hundreth and fiftie men that offred the incense.

36. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

37. Speake vnto Eleazar, the sonne of Aaron the Priest, that he take vp the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire beyond the altar: for they are halowed,

42. And when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, then they turned their faces toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and beholde, the cloude couered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.

43. Then Moses and Aaron were come before the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

44. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

45. Get you vp from among this Congregation: for I wil consume them quickly: then they fell vpon their faces.

46. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the

17. I pray thee that we may passe through thy countrey: we will not goe through the fieldes nor the vineyardes, neither will we drinke of the water of the welles: we will goe by the kings way, and neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left, vntill we be past thy borders.

18. And Edom answered him, Thou shalt not passe by mee, least I come out against thee with the sword.

19. Then the children of Israel said vnto him, We will goe vp by the hie way: and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water, I will then pay for it: I will onely (without any harme) goe through on my feete.

20. Hee answered againe, Thou shalt not goe through. The Edom came out against him with much people, and with a mightie power.

9. So Moses made a serpent of brasse, and set it vp for a signe: and when a serpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the serpent of brasse, and liued.

10. And ye children of Israel departed thence, and pitched in Oboth.

11. And they departed from Oboth, & pitched in lie-abarim, in the wildernesse, which is before Moab on the Eastside.

12. They remoued thence, and pitched vpon the riuer of Zared.

13. Thence they departed, & pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wildernesse, and commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites: (for Arnon is the border of Moab, betweene the Moabites and the Amorites)

14. Wherefore it is said in the

16. And from thence they turned to Beer: the same is the well where the Lord said vnto Moses, Assemble the people, and I wil giue them water.

20. And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the plaine of Moab, to the top of Pisgah that looketh toward Ieshimon.

21. Then Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, saying,

22. Let me goe through thy land: we wil not turne aside into the fieldes, nor into the vineyardes, neither drinke of the waters of ye welles: we will goe by the kings way, vntill we be past thy countrey.

32. And Moses sent to searche out Iaazer, and they tooke the townes belonging thereto, and rooted out the Amorites that were there.

33. And they turned and went vp toward Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan came out against them, hee, and all his people, to fight at Edrei.

34. Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thine hand and all his people, and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou diddest vnto Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

35. They smote him therefore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him: so they conquered his land.

15. Balak yet sent againe moe princes, and more honourable then they.

16. And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, 

17. For I wil promote thee vnto great honour, and wil do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.

18. And Balaam answered, and sayde vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak woulde giue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not goe beyonde the worde of the Lorde my God, to doe lesse or more.

19. Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me 

20. And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayd vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but onely what thing I say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe.

21. So Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab.

25. And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and dasht Balaams foote against the wall: wherefore hee smote her againe.

26. Then the Angel of the Lord went further, & stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left.

27. And when the asse sawe the Angell of the Lorde, she lay downe vnder Balaam: therefore Balaam was very wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe.

28. And the LORD 

29. And Balaam saide vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I woulde there were a sworde in mine hand, for nowe would I kill thee.

30. And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever

13. And Balak sayde vnto him, Come, I pray thee, with mee vnto another place, whence thou mayest see them, & thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: therefore curse them out of that place for my sake.

14. And he brought him into Sede-sophim to the top of Pisgah, and built seuen altars, and offred a bullocke, and a ramme on euery altar.

15. After, he sayde vnto Balak, Stande here by thy burnt offring, & I wil meete the Lord yonder.

25. Then Balak sayde vnto Balaam, Neither curse, nor blesse them at all.

26. But Balaam answered, & saide vnto Balak, Tolde not I thee, saying, All that the Lorde speaketh, that must I do?

27. And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another 

28. So Balak brought Balaam vnto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Ieshmon.

13. Then Moses commaunded the children of Israel, saying, This is the lande which yee shall inherite by lot, which the Lord commaunded to giue vnto nine tribes and halfe the tribe.

14. For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the housholdes of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad, according to their fathers housholdes, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh, haue receiued their inheritance.

15. Two tribes and an halfe tribe haue receiued their inheritance on this side of Iorden toward Iericho full East.

## Numbers 35

1. And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the plaine of Moab by Iorden, toward Iericho, saying,

2. Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the 

3. So they shall haue the cities to dwell in, & their suburbes shall be for their cattell, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.

4. And the suburbes of the cities, which ye shal giue vnto the Leuites, from the wall of the citie outward, shalbe a thousand cubites round about.

5. And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side 

6. And of the cities which yee shall giue vnto the Leuites, there shalbe sixe cities for refuge, which ye shal appoint, that he which killeth, may flee thither: and to them yee shall adde two and fourtie cities mo.

7. All the cities which yee shall giue to the Leuites, shalbe eight and fourtie cities: them shal ye giue with their suburbes.

8. And concerning the cities which yee shall giue, of the possession of the children of Israel: of many ye shall take mo, and of few ye shall take lesse: euery one shall giue of his cities vnto the Leuites, according to his inheritance, which hee inheriteth.

9. And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,

10. Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come ouer Iorden into the land of Canaan,

11. Ye shall appoint you cities, to bee cities of refuge for you, that the slayer, which slayeth any person vnwares, may flee thither.

12. And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the 

13. And of the cities which ye shall giue, sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge.

14. Ye shall give three cities 

15. These six cities shalbe a refuge for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that dwelleth among you, that euery one which killeth any person vnwares, may flee thither.

16. And if he 

17. And if he smite him with throwing a 

18. Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may be slaine, if he die, he is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death.

19. The reuenger of the blood himselfe shall slay the murtherer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.

20. But if hee thrust him of hate, or hurle at him by laying of wait, that he die,

21. Or smite him through enimitie with his hand, that he die, he that smote him shal die ye death: for hee is a murtherer: the reuenger of the blood shall slay the murtherer when he meeteth him.

22. But if he pusshed him vnaduisedly, and not of hatred, or cast vpon him any thing, without laying of waite,

23. Or any stone (whereby he might be slaine) and sawe him not, or caused it to fall vpon him, and he die, and was not his enemie, neither sought him any harme,

24. Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the 

25. And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the 

26. But if the slayer come without the borders of the citie of his refuge, whither he was fled,

27. And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the

29. So these [things] shall be for a 

30. Whosoeuer killeth any person, the Iudge shall slay the murtherer, through witnesses: but one witnesse shall not testifie against a person to cause him to die.

31. Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which [is] 

32. Also ye shall take no recompense for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge, that he should come againe, and dwell in the lande, before the death of the hie Priest.

33. So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye [are]: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be

3. If they bee married to any of the sonnes of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and shalbe put vnto the inheritance of the tribe whereof they shalbe: so shall it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.

4. And when the 

5. And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said 

6. This is the thing that the Lorde hath commaunded, concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, They shall be wiues, to whome they thinke best, onely to the familie of the tribe of their father shall they marry:

7. So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remoue from tribe to tribe, for euery one of the children of Israel shal ioyne himselfe to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

8. And every daughter, that possesseth an

10. As the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad.

11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, & Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad were married vnto their fathers brothers sonnes,

12. They were wiues to certaine of the families of the sonnes of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph: so their inheritance remained in the tribe of the familie of their father.
