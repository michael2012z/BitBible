## 2 Chronicles 1

1. And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 

2. Then Solomon 

3. So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that [was] at 

4. But the Arke of God had Dauid brought vp from Kiriath-iearim, when Dauid had made preparation for it: for he had pitched a tent for it in Ierusalem.

5. Moreover the 

6. And Salomon offred there before the Lord vpon the brasen altar that was in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: euen a thousand burnt offrings offred he vpon it.

7. The same night did God appeare vnto Salomon, and sayde vnto him, Aske what I shall giue thee.

8. And Salomon sayde vnto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father and hast made me to reigne in his stead.

9. Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be 

10. Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may 

11. And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the 

12. Wisdome and knowledge is granted vnto thee, and I will giue thee riches and treasures and honour, so that there hath not bene the like among the Kings which were before thee, neither after thee shal there be the like.

13. Then Salomon came from the hie place, that was at Gibeon, to Ierusalem from before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and reigned ouer Israel.

14. And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the 

15. And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem [as plenteous] as 

16. And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: 

17. They came vp also and brought out of Egypt some charet, worth sixe hundreth shekels of siluer, that is an horse for an hundreth and fiftie: and thus they brought horses to all the Kings of the Hittites, and to the Kings of Aram by their meanes.

## 2 Chronicles 2

1. Then Salomon determined to builde an house for the Name of the Lord, and an house for his kingdome.

2. And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and 

3. And Salomon sent to Huram the king of Tyrus, saying, As thou hast done to Dauid my father, and didst sende him cedar trees to buylde him an house to dwell in, so do to me.

4. Behold, I buylde an house vnto the Name of the Lord my God, to sanctifie it vnto him, and to burne sweete incense before him, and for the continuall shewbread, and for the burnt offrings of the morning and euening, on the Sabbath dayes, and in the new moneths, & in the solemne feastes of the Lorde our God: this is a perpetuall thing for Israel.

5. And the house which I buylde, is great: for great is our God aboue all gods.

6. But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who [am] I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn 

7. Sende me nowe therefore a cunning man that can worke in golde, in siluer, & in brasse, and in yron, & in purple, and crimosin & blue silke, & that can graue in grauen worke with the cunning men that are with me in Iudah & in Ierusalem, whom Dauid my father hath prepared.

8. Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and 

9. That they may prepare me timber in abudance: for the house which I doe buylde, is great and wonderfull.

10. And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty 

11. Then Huram King of Tyrus answered in writing which he sent to Salomon, Because the Lorde hath loued his people, he hath made thee King ouer them.

12. Huram said moreover, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a 

13. Now therefore I haue sent a wise man, and of vnderstanding of my father Hurams,

14. The son of a woman of the 

15. Now therefore the wheate and the barley, the oyle and the wine, which my lorde hath spoken of, let him send vnto his seruants.

16. And we wil cut wood in Lebanon as much as thou shalt neede, and will bring it to thee in raftes by the sea to Iapho, so thou mayest cary them to Ierusalem.

17. And Salomon nombred al the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the nombring that his father Dauid had nombred them: & they were found an hundreth and three & fiftie thousand, and sixe hundreth.

18. And he set seuentie thousande of them to the burden, and fourescore thousande to hewe stones in the mountaine, and three thousande and sixe hundreth ouerseers to cause the people to worke.

## 2 Chronicles 3

1. Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount 

2. And he beganne to buylde in the seconde moneth and the second day, in the fourth yeere of his reigne.

3. Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first 

4. And the porch that [was] in the front [of the house], the length [of it was] according to the 

5. And the greater house he sieled with firre tree which he ouerlayd with good golde, & graued thereon palme trees and chaines.

6. And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold [was] gold of 

7. The house, I say, the beames, postes, and walles thereof & the doores thereof ouerlayde he with gold, & graued Cherubims vpon the walles.

8. He made also the house of the most holy place: the length thereof was in the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, & the breadth thereof twentie cubites: and he ouerlayde it with the best golde, of sixe hundreth talents.

9. And the weight of the nayles was fiftie shekels of golde, and hee ouerlayde the chambers with golde.

10. And in the house of the most holy place he made two Cherubims wrought like children, and ouerlayd them with golde.

11. And the winges of the Cherubims were twentie cubites long: the one wing was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing fiue cubites, reaching to the wing of the other Cherub.

12. Likewise the wing of ye other Cherub was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of the house, & the other wing fiue cubites ioyning to the wing of the other Cherub.

13. The wings of these Cherubims were spread abroade twentie cubites: they stoode on their feete, and their faces were toward the house.

14. And he made the 

15. Also he made before the house two pillars of 

16. And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of the pillars; and made an 

17. And he set vp the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hande and the other on the left, and called that on the right hand Iachin, & that on the left hand Boaz.

## 2 Chronicles 4

1. And hee made an altar of brasse twentie cubites long, and twentie cubites broade, and ten cubites hie.

2. Also he made a molten 

3. And under 

4. It stoode vpon twelue oxen: three looked toward the North, and three looked towarde the West, and three looked towarde the South, and three looked towarde the East, and the Sea stoode about vpon them, and all their hinder parts were inwarde.

5. And the thickness of it [was] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; [and] it received and held 

6. He made also ten caldrons, and put fiue on the right hand, and fiue on the left, to wash in them, and to clense in them that which apperteined to the burnt offrings: but the Sea was for the Priests to wash in.

7. And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to 

8. And he made ten tables, & put them in the Temple, fiue on the right hand, & fiue on the left: and he made an hundreth basens of golde.

9. Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great 

10. And he set the Sea on the right side Eastward toward the South.

11. And Huram made pottes and besoms and basens, and Huram finished the worke that hee shoulde make for King Salomon for the house of God,

12. To wit, two pillars, and the bowles & the chapiters on the top of ye two pillars, & two grates to couer the two bowles of the chapiters which were vpon the toppe of the pillars:

13. And foure hundreth pomegranates for the two grates, two rowes of pomegranates for euery grate to couer the two bowles of the chapiters, that were vpon the pillars.

14. He made also bases, and made caldrons vpon the bases:

15. And a Sea, and twelue bulles vnder it:

16. The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram 

17. In the playne of Iorden did the King cast them in clay betweene Succoth & Zeredathah.

18. And Salomon made al these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of brasse could not be rekoned.

19. And Solomon made all the vessels that [were for] the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the 

20. Moreouer the candlestickes, with their lampes to burne them after the maner, before the oracle, of pure golde.

21. And the floures and the lampes, and the snuffers of gold, which was fine golde.

22. And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, [of] pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy [place], and the doors of the house of the temple, [were 

## 2 Chronicles 5

1. So was all the worke finished that Salomon made for the house of the Lord, and Salomon brought in the things that Dauid his father had dedicated, with the siluer and the golde, and all the vessels, and put them among the treasures of the house of God.

2. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the 

3. Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the 

4. And all the Elders of Israel came, and the Leuites tooke vp the Arke.

5. And they caried vp the Arke and the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle, those did the Priests and Leuites bring vp.

6. And King Salomon & all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled vnto him, were before ye Arke, offring sheepe & bullocks, which could not be told nor nobred for multitude.

7. So the Priests brought the Arke of the couenant of the Lord vnto his place, into the Oracle of the house, into the most Holy place, euen vnder the wings of the Cherubims.

8. For ye Cherubims stretched out their wings ouer the place of the Arke, and the Cherubims couered the Arke and the barres thereof aboue.

9. And they drewe out the barres, that the endes of the barres might bee seene out of the Arke before the Oracle, but they were not seene without: and there they are vnto this day.

10. [There was] nothing in the ark save 

11. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy [place]: (for all the priests [that were] present were 

12. And the Leuites the singers of all sortes, as of Asaph, of Heman, of Ieduthun, and of their sonnes and of their brethren, being clad in fine linen, stoode with cymbales, and with violes and harpes at the East ende of the altar, and with them an hundreth and twentie Priestes blowing with trumpets:

13. It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers [were] 

14. So that the Priests could not stand to minister, because of the cloude: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.

## 2 Chronicles 6

1. Then 

2. And I haue built thee an house to dwell in, an habitation for thee to dwell in for euer.

3. And the King turned his face, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel (for all the Congregation of Israel stoode there )

4. And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, & hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,

5. Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no citie of al the tribes of Israel to buylde an house, that my Name might be there, neyther chose I any man to be a ruler ouer my people Israel:

6. But I haue chosen Ierusalem, that my Name might be there, & haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel.

7. And it was in the heart of Dauid my father to builde an house vnto the Name of the Lord God of Israel,

8. But the Lorde sayde to Dauid my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to buylde an house vnto my Name, thou diddest well, that thou wast so minded.

9. Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house, but thy sonne which shall come out of thy loynes, he shall buylde an house vnto my Name.

10. And the Lorde hath performed his worde that he spake: and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father, and am set on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised, & haue built an house to the Name of the Lord God of Israel.

11. And in it have I put the ark, wherein [is] the 

12. And 

13. For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and 

14. And sayd, O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heauen nor in earth, which keepest couenant, and mercie vnto thy seruants, that walke before thee with all their heart.

15. Thou that hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him: for thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as appeareth this day.

16. Therefore now Lord God of Israel, keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him, saying, Thou shalt not want a man in my sight, that shall sit vpon the throne of Israel: so that thy sonnes take heede to their wayes, to walke in my Lawe, as thou hast walked before me.

17. And now, O Lorde God of Israel, let thy worde be verified, which thou spakest vnto thy seruant Dauid.

18. (Is it true in deede that God will dwell with man on earth? beholde, the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to conteine thee: how much more vnable is this house, which I haue buylt?)

19. But haue thou respect to the prayer of thy seruant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to heare the crye and prayer which thy seruant prayeth before thee,

20. That thine 

21. Heare thou therefore the supplication of thy seruant, and of thy people Israel, which they pray in this place: and heare thou in the place of thine habitation, euen in heauen, and when thou hearest, be mercifull.

22. If a man sin against his 

23. Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way 

24. And when thy people Israel shalbe ouerthrowen before the enemie, because they haue sinned against thee, and turne againe, and confesse thy Name, and pray, and make supplication before thee in this house,

25. Then heare thou in heauen, and be mercifull vnto the sinne of thy people Israel, and bring them againe vnto the land which thou gauest to them and to their fathers.

26. When heauen shall be shut vp, and there shalbe no rayne, because they haue sinned against thee, and shall pray in this place, and confesse thy Name, and turne from their sinne, when thou doest afflict them,

27. Then heare thou in heauen, and pardon the sinne of thy seruants, and of thy people Israel (when thou hast taught them the good way wherein they may walke) and giue rayne vpon thy lande, which thou hast giuen vnto thy people for an inheritance.

28. When there shalbe famine in the land, when there shalbe pestilence, blasting, or mildew, when there shall be grashopper, or caterpiller, when their enemie shall besiege them in the cities of their land, or any plague or any sickenesse,

29. Then what prayer and supplication so euer shalbe made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, whe euery one shall knowe his owne plague, and his owne disease, and shall stretch forth his hands toward this house,

30. Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose

32. Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and 

33. Heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place, and doe according to all that the stranger calleth for vnto thee, that all the people of the earth may knowe thy Name, and feare thee like thy people Israel, and that they may knowe, that thy Name is called vpon in this house which I haue built.

34. If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that 

35. Then heare thou in heauen their prayer & their supplication, and iudge their cause.

36. If they sinne against thee ( for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them and deliuer them vnto the enemies, and they take them and cary them away captiue vnto a land farre or neere,

37. If they turne againe to their heart in the lande whither they be caryed in captiues, and turne and pray vnto thee in the lande of their captiuitie, saying, We haue sinned, we haue transgressed and haue done wickedly,

38. If they turne againe to thee with all their heart, and with all their soule in the land of their captiuitie, whither they haue caryed them captiues, and pray toward their land, which thou gauest vnto their fathers, & toward the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I haue built for thy Name,

39. Then heare thou in heauen, in the place of thine habitation their prayer and their supplication, and iudge their cause, and be mercifull vnto thy people, which haue sinned against thee.

40. Nowe my God, I beseech thee, let thine eyes be open, & thine eares attent vnto the prayer that is made in this place.

41. Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy

## 2 Chronicles 7

1. Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the 

2. So that the Priestes could not euter into the house of the Lorde, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lordes house.

3. And when all the children of Israel saw the fire, and the glory of the Lord come downe vpon the house, they bowed themselues with their faces to the earth vpon the pauement, and worshipped and praysed the Lord, saying, For he is good, because his mercy lasteth for euer.

4. Then the King and all the people offred sacrifices before the Lord.

5. And King Salomon offered a sacrifice of two and twentie thousand bullockes, and an hundreth and twentie thousand sheepe. so the King and all the people dedicated the house of God.

6. And the Priests waited on their offices, and the Leuites with the instruments of musicke of the Lorde, which King Dauid had made to praise the Lord, Because his mercy lasteth for euer: whe Dauid praysed God by them, the Priestes also blewe trumpets ouer against them: and all they of Israel stoode by.

7. Moreouer Salomon halowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord: for there hee had prepared burnt offerings, and the fatte of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Salomon had made, was not able to receiue the burnt offering, and the meate offring, and the fat.

8. Also at the same time Solomon kept 

9. And in the eighth day they 

10. And on the 

11. So Salomon finished the house of the Lorde, and the Kings house, and all that came into Salomons heart to make in the house of the Lorde: and he prospered in his house.

12. And the Lord appeared to Salomon by night and said to him, I haue heard thy prayer, and haue chosen this place for my selfe to be an house of sacrifice.

13. If I shut the heauen that there be no raine, or if I commaunde the grashopper to deuoure the lande, or if I sende pestilence among my people,

14. If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will 

15. Then mine eies shalbe open & mine eares attent vnto the prayer made in this place.

16. For I haue nowe chosen and sanctified this house, that my Name may be there for euer: and mine eyes & mine heart shalbe there perpetually.

17. And if thou wilt walke before me, as Dauid thy father walked, to doe according vnto all that I haue commanded thee, and shalt obserue my statutes and my iudgements,

18. Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdome, according as I made the couenant with Dauid thy father, saying, Thou shalt not want a man to be ruler in Israel.

19. But if ye turne away, and forsake my statutes and my commandements which I haue set before you, and shall goe and serue other gods, and worshippe them,

20. Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have 

21. And this house which is most hie, shall be an astonishment to euery one that passeth by it, so that he shall say, Why hath the Lorde done thus to this lande, and to this house?

22. And they shall answere, Because they forsooke the Lorde God of their fathers, which brought them out of the lande of Egypt, and haue taken holde on other gods, and haue worshipped them, and serued them, therefore hath he brought all this euill vpon them.

## 2 Chronicles 8

1. And it came to pass at the end of 

2. That the cities which Huram had 

3. And Salomon went to Hamath Zobah, and ouercame it.

4. And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the 

5. Also he built 

6. Also Baalath, and al the cities of store that Salomon had, and all the charet cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and euery pleasaunt place that Salomon had a minde to builde in Ierusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the lande of his dominion.

7. And all the people that were left to ye Hittites, and ye Amorites, and Perizzites, and the Hiuuites, and the Iebusites, which were not of Israel,

8. But of their children which were left after them in the lande, whome the children of Israel had not consumed, euen them did Salomon make tributaries vntill this day.

9. But of the children of Israel did Salomon make no seruantes for his worke: for they were men of warre, and his chiefe princes, and the captaines of his charets and of his horsemen.

10. And these [were] the chief of king Solomon's officers, [even] 

11. Then Salomon brought vp the daughter of Pharaoh out of the citie of Dauid, into the house that he had built for her: for he saide, My wife shall not dwel in the house of Dauid King of Israel: for it is holy, because that the Arke of the Lorde came vnto it.

12. Then Salomon offered burnt offrings vnto the Lord, on the altar of the Lorde, which he had built before the porche,

13. Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, 

14. And he set the courses of the Priestes to their offices, according to the order of Dauid his father, and the Leuites in their watches, for to praise and minister before the Priestes euery day, and the porters by their courses, at euery gate: for so was the commandement of Dauid the man of God.

15. And they declined not from the commandement of the King, concerning the Priests and the Leuites, touching al things, and touching the treasures.

16. Now all the

## 2 Chronicles 9

1. And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to 

2. And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was 

3. Then the Queene of Sheba sawe the wisedome of Salomon, and the house that he had buylt,

4. And the meate of his table, and the sitting of his seruants, and the order of his wayters, and their apparel, and his butlers, and their apparel, & his burnt offrings which he offred in the house of the Lorde, and she was greatly astonied.

5. And she saide to the King, It was a true worde which I heard in mine owne lande of thy sayings, and of thy wisedome:

6. Howbeit I beleeued not their report, vntil I came, and mine eyes had seene it: & beholde, the one halfe of thy great wisedom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.

7. Happie are thy men, and happie are these thy seruants, which stande before thee alway, and heare thy wisedome.

8. Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his

10. And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought 

11. And the king made [of] the algum trees 

12. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, 

13. Also the weight of golde that came to Salomon in one yeere, was sixe hundreth three score and sixe talents of golde,

14. Besides that which chapmen and marchants brought: and all the Kings of Arabia, and the princes of the countrey brought golde and siluer to Salomon.

15. And king Solomon made two hundred targets [of] beaten gold: 

16. And three hundreth shieldes of beaten golde: three hundreth shekels of golde went to one shielde, and the King put them in the house of the wood of Lebanon.

17. And the King made a great throne of yuorie and ouerlaid it with pure golde.

18. And [there were] six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, [which were] 

19. And twelue lyons stoode there on the sixe steps on either side: there was not the like made in any kingdome.

20. And all King Salomons drinking vessels were of golde, and all the vessels of the house of the wood of Lebanon were of pure gold: for siluer was nothing esteemed in ye dayes of Salomo.

21. For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of 

22. So King Salomon excelled all the Kings of the earth in riches and wisedome.

23. And all the Kings of the earth sought the presence of Salomon, to heare his wisedome that God had put in his heart.

24. And they brought euery man his present, vessels of siluer, and vessels of golde, and raiment, armour, and sweet odours, horses, and mules, from yeere to yeere.

25. And Solomon had 

26. And he reigned ouer all the Kings from the Riuer euen vnto the land of the Philistims, and to the border of Egypt.

27. And the king made silver in Jerusalem 

28. And they brought vnto Salomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all landes.

29. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, [are] they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer 

30. And Salomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel fourtie yeeres.

31. And Salomon slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the citie of Dauid his father: and Rehoboam his sonne reigned in his steade.

## 2 Chronicles 10

1. And Rehoboam 

2. And when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat heard it, (which was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Salomon the King) he returned out of Egypt.

3. And they sent and called him: so came Ieroboam and all Israel, and communed with Rehoboam, saying,

4. Thy father 

5. And he sayde to them, Depart yet three dayes, then come againe vnto me; the people departed.

6. And King Rehoboam tooke counsel with the olde men that had stande before Salomon his father, while hee yet liued, saying, What counsell giue ye that I may answere this people?

7. And they spake vnto him, saying, If thou be kinde to this people, and please them, and speake louing words to them, they will be thy seruants for euer.

8. But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that 

9. And he sayd vnto them, What counsel giue ye, that we may answere this people, which haue spoken to mee, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put vpon vs, lighter?

10. And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My 

11. Now whereas my father did burden you with a grieuous yoke, I will yet increase your yoke: my father hath chastised you with roddes, but I will correct you with scourges.

12. Then Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the King had appointed saying, Come againe to me the third day.

And when Asa heard these wordes, and the prophesie of Obed the Prophet, he was encouraged, and tooke away the abominations out of all the lande of Iudah, and Beniamin, and out of the cities which he had taken of mount Ephraim, and he renued the altar of the Lorde, that was before the porche of the Lorde.

9. And he gathered all Iudah and Beniamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for there fell many to him out of Israel, when they sawe that the Lorde his God was with him.

4. And Benhadad hearkened vnto King Asa, and sent the captaines of the armies which hee had, against the cities of Israel; they smote Iion, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

5. And when Baasha heard it, he left building of Ramah, and let his worke cease.

6. Then Asa the King tooke all Iudah, and caryed away the stones of Ramah and the tymber thereof, wherewith Baasha did builde, and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

7. And at that same time Hanani the Seer came to Asa King of Iudah, and saide vnto him, Because thou hast rested vpon the king of Aram, and not rested in the Lorde thy God, therefore is the hoste of the King of Aram escaped out of thine hande.

8. The Ethiopians and the Lubims, were they not a great hoste with charets & horsemen, exceeding many? Yet because thou diddest rest vpon the Lord, he deliuered them into thine had.

9. For the eyes of the Lorde beholde all the earth to shewe him selfe strong with them that are of perfite heart towarde him: thou hast then done foolishly in this: therefore from henceforth thou shalt haue warres.

26. So there was great ioye in Ierusalem: for since the time of Salomon the sonne of Dauid King of Israel there was not the like thing in Ierusalem.

27. Then the priests the Levites arose and

1. Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and

4. Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the 

5. And when the commaundement was spread, the children of Israel brought abundance of first fruites, of corne, wine, and oyle, and honie, and of all the increase of the fielde, and the tithes of all things brought they abundantly.

6. And [concerning] the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things 

7. In the thirde moneth they beganne to lay the foundation of the heapes, and finished them in the seuenth moneth.

8. And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they 

9. And Hezekiah questioned with the Priests and the Leuites concerning the heapes.

10. And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have 

11. And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lorde: and they prepared them,

12. And caryed in the first fruites, and the tithes, and the dedicate things faithfully: and ouer them was Conaniah the Leuite, the chiefe, and Shimei his brother the seconde.

13. And Iehiel, and Azariah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Ierimoth, and Iozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah were ouerseers by the appointment of Conaniah, & Shimei his brother, and by the commandement of Hezekiah the King, and of Azariah the chiefe of the house of God.

14. And Kore the sonne of Imnah the Leuite porter towarde the East, was ouer the things that were willingly offred vnto God, to distribute the oblations of the Lorde, and the holy things that were consecrate.

15. And at his hande were Eden, and Miniamin, and Ieshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, & Shechaniah, in the cities of the Priestes, to distribute with fidelitie to their brethren by courses, both to the great and small,

16. Beside their genealogy of males, 

17. Both to the generation of the Priestes after the house of their fathers, and to the Leuites from twentie yeere olde and aboue, according to their charge in their courses:

18. And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their

20. And thus did Hezekiah throughout al Iudah, and did well, and vprightly, and truely before the Lorde his God.

21. And in all the workes that he began for the seruice of the house of God, both in the Law and in the commandements, to seeke his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

## 2 Chronicles 32

1. After these things faithfully described, Saneherib King of Asshur came and entred into Iudah, and besieged the strong cities, & thought to winne them for him selfe.

2. When Hezekiah sawe that Saneherib was come, and that his purpose was to fight against Ierusalem,

3. Then he tooke counsell with his princes and his nobles, to stoppe the water of the fountaines without the citie: and they did helpe him.

4. So many of the people assembled themselues, and stopt all the fountaines, and the riuer that ranne through the middes of the countrey, saying, Why should the Kings of Asshur come, and finde much water?

5. Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised [it] up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired 

6. And he set captaines of warre ouer the people, and assembled them to him in the broade place of the gate of the citie, and spake comfortably vnto them, saying,

7. Be strong and couragious: feare not, neither be afraide for the King of Asshur, neither for all the multitude that is with him: for there be mo with vs, then is with him.

8. With him [is] an 

9. After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he [himself laid siege] 

10. Thus saith Saneherib the King of Asshur, Wherein doe ye trust, that ye will remaine in Ierusalem, during the siege?

11. Doeth not Hezekiah entice you to giue ouer your selues vnto death by famine and by thirst, saying, The Lorde our God shall deliuer vs out of the hande of the King of Asshur?

12. Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his

17. He wrote also letters, blaspheming the Lorde God of Israel and speaking against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other countreies could not deliuer their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliuer his people out of mine hande.

18. Then they 

19. And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, [which were] the

21. And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and 

22. So the Lorde saued Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem from the hande of Saneherib King of Asshur, and from the hande of all other, and maintained them on euery side.

23. And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was 

24. In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him 

25. But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [done] unto him; for his heart 

26. Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled him selfe (after that his heart was lifted vp) he and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and the wrath of the Lorde came not vpon them in the dayes of Hezekiah.

27. Hezekiah also had exceeding much riches and honour, and he gate him treasures of siluer, and of golde, and of precious stones, and of sweete odours, and of shieldes, and of all pleasant vessels:

28. And of store houses for the increase of wheat and wine & oyle, and stalles for all beasts, and rowes for the stables.

29. And he made him cities, and had possession of sheepe and oxen in abundance: for God had giuen him substance exceeding much.

30. This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of 

31. Howbeit in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was [done] in the land, God left him, to 

32. Concerning the rest of the actes of Hezekiah, and his goodnesse, beholde, they are written in the vision of Ishiah the Prophet, the sonne of Amoz, in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel.

33. So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the highest sepulchre of the sonnes of Dauid: and all Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem did him honour at his death: and Manasseh his sonne reigned in his stead.

## 2 Chronicles 33

1. Manasseh was twelue yeere olde, when he beganne to reigne, and he reigned fiue and fiftie yeere in Ierusalem:

2. And he did euill in the sight of the Lorde, like the abominations of the heathen, who the Lorde had cast out before the children of Israel.

3. For he went backe and built the hie places, which Hezekiah his father had broken downe: and he set vp altars for Baalim, and made groues, and worshipped all the hoste of the heauen, and serued them.

4. Also he built altars in the house of the Lorde, whereof the Lorde had saide, In Ierusalem shall my Name be for euer.

5. And he built altars for all the hoste of the heauen in the two courtes of the house of the Lorde.

6. 
          

7. He put also the carued image, which he had made, in the house of God: whereof God had said to Dauid and to Salomon his sonne, In this house and in Ierusalem, which I haue chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my Name for euer,

8. Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the 

9. So Manasseh made Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem to erre, and to doe worse then the heathen, whome the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.

10. And the LORD spake 

11. Wherefore the Lorde brought vpon them the captaines of the hoste of the King of Asshur, which tooke Manasseh and put him in fetters, & bound him in chaines, & caryed him to Babel.

12. And when he was in tribulation, he prayed to the Lorde his God, and humbled him selfe greatly before the God of his fathers,

13. And prayed unto him: and he was 

14. Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of 

15. And he tooke away the strange gods and the image out of the house of the Lord, & all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lorde, and in Ierusalem, and cast them out of the citie.

16. And he repaired the 

17. Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, [yet] unto the 

18. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his 

19. And his prayer and how God was intreated of him, and all his sinne, and his trespasse, and the places wherein he built hie places, and set groues and images (before he was humbled) behold, they are written in the booke of the Seers.

20. So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own 

21. Amon was two and twentie yeere olde, when he began to reigne, and reigned two yeere in Ierusalem.

22. But he did euill in the sight of the Lorde, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed to all the images, which Manasseh his father had made, and serued them,

23. And he humbled not him selfe before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled himselfe: but this Amon trespassed more and more.

24. And his seruants conspired against him, & slewe him in his owne house.

25. But the people of the land slewe all them that had conspired against King Amon: and the people of the land made Iosiah his sonne King in his steade.

## 2 Chronicles 34

1. Iosiah was eight yeere olde when hee began to reigne, and he reigned in Ierusalem one and thirtie yeere.

2. And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of

7. And when he had 

8. Then in the eightenth yere of his reigne, when hee had purged the lande and the Temple, he sent Shaphan the sonne of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the gouernour of the citie, & Ioah the sonne of Ioahaz the recorder, to repaire the house of the Lord his God.

9. And when they came to Hilkiah the hie Priest, they deliuered ye money that was brought into the house of God, which the Leuites that kept the doore, had gathered at the hand of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and of all the residue of Israel, and of all Iudah and Beniamin, and of the inhabitantes of Ierusalem.

10. 
          

11. Even to the artificers and builders gave they [it], to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the 

12. And the men did the work 

13. And they were ouer the bearers of burdens, and them that set forwarde all the workemen in euery worke: and of the Leuites were scribes, and officers and porters.

14. And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a 

15. Therefore Hilkiah answered and sayde to Shaphan the chaceler, I haue found the booke of the Law in the house of the Lord: & Hilkiah gaue the booke to Shaphan.

16. And Shaphan carried the book to 

17. For they haue gathered the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and haue deliuered it into the handes of the ouerseers, and to the handes of the workemen.

18. Also Shaphan ye chanceler declared to the King, saying, Hilkiah the Priest hath giuen mee a booke, and Shaphan read it before the King.

19. And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he 

20. And the King commanded Hilkiah, & Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, & Abdon the sonne of Micah, and Shaphan the chanceler, & Asaiah the Kings seruant, saying,

21. Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our

24. Thus saith the Lorde, Beholde, I will bring euill vpon this place, and vpon the inhabitantes thereof, euen all the curses, that are written in the booke which they haue read before the King of Iudah:

25. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their 

26. But to the King of Iudah, who sent you to enquire of the Lord, so shal ye say vnto him, Thus saith the Lorde God of Israel, The words which thou hast heard, shal come to passe.

27. Because thine heart was 

28. Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this 

29. Then the King sent and gathered all the Elders of Iudah and Ierusalem.

30. And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and 

31. And the King stood by his pillar, and made a couenant before the Lorde, to walke after the Lord, and to keepe his commandements, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soule, and that he would accomplish the wordes of the couenant written in the same booke.

32. And he caused all that were found in Ierusalem, and Beniamin to stande to it: and the inhabitants of Ierusalem did according to the couenant of God, euen the God of their fathers.

33. And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that [pertained] to the children of Israel, and made all

1. Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the 

2. And he appointed the Priestes to their charges, and incouraged them to the seruice of the house of the Lord,

3. And said unto the Levites that 

4. And prepare your selues by the houses of your fathers according to your courses, as Dauid the King of Israel hath written, and according to the writing of Salomon his sonne,

5. And stande in the Sanctuarie according to the deuision of the families of your brethren the children of the people, and after the deuision of the familie of the Leuites:

6. So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and 

7. Iosiah also gaue to the people sheepe, lambs and kiddes, all for the Passeouer, euen to all that were present, to the nomber of thirtie thousand, and three thousande bullocks: these were of the Kings substance.

8. And his princes offred willingly vnto the people, to the Priests and to the Leuites: Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Iehiel, rulers of the house of God, gaue vnto the Priests for the Passeouer, euen two thousand and sixe hundreth sheepe, and three hundreth bullockes.

9. 
          

10. Thus the seruice was prepared, and the Priests stoode in their places, also the Leuites in their orders, according to the Kings commandement:

11. And they killed the passover, and the priests 

12. And they removed the 

13. And they rosted the Passeouer with fire, according to ye custome, but the sanctified things they sod in pots, pannes, and cauldrons, and distributed them quickely to all the people.

14. Afterwarde also they prepared for them selues and for the Priestes: for the Priestes the sonnes of Aaron were occupied in offering of burnt offrings, and the fat vntill night: therefore the Leuites prepared for them selues, and for the Priests the sonnes of Aaron.

15. And the singers the sons of Asaph [were] in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's 

16. So all the seruice of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keepe the Passeouer, and to offer burnt offerings vpon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandement of King Iosiah.

17. And the children of Israel that were present, kept the Passeouer the same time, and the feast of the vnleauened bread seuen dayes.

18. And there was no Passeouer kept like that, in Israel, from the dayes of Samuel the Prophet: neyther did all the Kings of Israel keepe such a Passeouer as Iosiah kept, and the Priestes and the Leuites, and all Iudah, and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem.

19. In 

20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against 

21. But he sent messengers to him, saying, What haue I to doe with thee, thou King of Iudah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house of mine enemie, and God commanded me to make haste: leaue of to come against God, which is with me, least he destroy thee.

22. Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but 

23. And the shooters shot at king Iosiah: then the King saide to his seruants, Cary me away, for I am very sicke.

24. His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in [one of] the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem 

25. And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they [are] written in the

12. And he did euill in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himselfe before Ieremiah the Prophet at the commandement of the Lorde,

14. All the chiefe of the Priestes also and of the people trespassed wonderfully, according to all the abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lorde which he had sanctified in Ierusalem.

15. And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers,
