7. So that ye were as ensamples to all that beleeue in Macedonia and in Achaia.

8. For from you sounded out the worde of the Lord, not in Macedonia and in Achaia only: but your faith also which is toward God, spred abroad in all quarters, that we neede not to speake any thing.

2. And haue sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God, and our labour felow in the Gospel of Christ, to stablish you, and to comfort you touching your faith,

3. That no man should be moved by these afflictions: 

4. For verily when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulations, euen as it came to passe, and ye knowe it.

5. Euen for this cause, when I could no longer forbeare, I sent him that I might knowe of your faith, lest the tempter had tempted you in any sort, and that our labour had bene in vaine.

10. Yea, and that thing verily yee doe vnto all the brethren, which are throughout all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more,

1. But 

2. For ye your selues knowe perfectly, that the day of the Lorde shall come, euen as a thiefe in the night.

3. For when they shall say, Peace, and safetie, then shall come vpon them sudden destruction, as the trauaile vpon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape,

4. 
          

5. Yee are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, neither of darkenesse.

6. Therefore let vs not sleepe as do other, but let vs watch and be sober.

7. For they that sleepe, sleepe in the night, and they that be drunken, are drunken in the night.
