2. Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.

1. But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in

3. And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having 

4. For in great affliction, & anguish of heart I wrote vnto you with many teares: not that yee should be made sorie, but that ye might perceiue the loue which I haue, specially vnto you.

5. 
          

6. It is sufficient vnto the same man, that hee was rebuked of many.

7. So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to

10. To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the

15. But euen vnto this day, whe Moses is read, the vaile is laid ouer their hearts.

16. Neuertheles when their heart shall be turned to the Lord, the vaile shalbe taken away.

1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the

3. I speak not [this] to 

4. I vse great boldnesse of speach toward you: I reioyce greatly in you: I am filled with comfort, and am exceeding ioyous in all our tribulation.

5. For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on euery side, fightings without, and terrours within.

6. Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are 

7. And not by his comming onely, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted of you, when he tolde vs your great desire, your mourning, your feruent minde to me warde, so that I reioyced much more.

8. 
          

9. Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to 

10. For 

11. For beholde, this thing that ye haue bene godly sory, what great care it hath wrought in you: yea, what clearing of yourselues: yea, what indignation: yea, what feare: yea, howe great desire: yea, what a zeale: yea, what reuenge: in all things ye haue shewed your selues, that ye are pure in this matter.

12. Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the 

13. Therefore we were comforted, because ye were comforted: but rather we reioyced much more for the ioye of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.

14. For if that I haue boasted any thing to him of you, I haue not bene ashamed: but as I haue spoken vnto you all things in trueth, euen so our boasting vnto Titus was true.

15. And his inwarde affection is more aboundant toward you, when he remembreth the obedience of you all, and howe with feare and trembling ye receiued him.

16. I reioyce therefore that I may put my confidence in you in all things.

1. Moreover,

4. Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the 

5. 
          

6. That we should exhort Titus, that as hee had begon, so he would also accomplish the same grace among you also.

7. Therefore, as yee abound in euery thing, in faith and woorde, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your loue towardes vs, euen so see that yee abound in this grace also.

8. 
          

9.

16. 
          

17. Because hee accepted the exhortation, yea, hee was so carefull that of his owne accorde hee went vnto you.

18. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] 

19. And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this 

20. Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this 

21. Prouiding for honest thinges, not onely before the Lord, but also before men.

22. And we haue sent with them our brother, whom we haue oft times prooued to be diligent in many thinges, but nowe much more diligent, for the great confidence, which I haue in you.

23. Whether [any do enquire] of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our

1. For 

2. For I knowe your readinesse of minde, whereof I boast my selfe of you vnto them of Macedonia, and say, that Achaia was prepared a yeere agoe, and your zeale hath prouoked many.

3. Nowe haue I sent the brethren, lest our reioycing ouer you shoulde bee in vaine in this behalfe, that yee (as I haue sayde) be readie:

4. Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same 

5. Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] 

6.

## 2 Corinthians 10

1. Now 

2. But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked 

3. 
          

4. (For the weapons of our warfare [are] not 

5. Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, 

6. And hauing ready the vengeance against all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

7. 
          

8. For though I shoulde boast somewhat more of our authoritie, which the Lorde hath giuen vs for edification, and not for your destruction, I should haue no shame.

9. This I say, that I may not seeme as it were to feare you with letters.

10. For [his] letters, say 

11. Let such one thinke this, that such as wee are in woorde by letters, when we are absent, such wil we be also in deede, when we are present.

12. 
          

13. But we will not boast of things without [our] 

14. For we stretche not our selues beyonde our measure, as though wee had not attained vnto you: for euen to you also haue we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ,

15. Not boasting of things 

16. To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in 

17.

4. 
          

5. Verely I suppose that I was not inferior to the very chiefe Apostles.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. I robbed other Churches, and tooke wages of them to doe you seruice.

9. And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, 

10. As the 

11. Wherefore? because I loue you not? God knoweth.

12. But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they

14. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of 

15. Therefore it is no great thing, though his ministers transforme themselues, as though they were the ministers of righteousnes, whose end shall be according to their workes.

16. 
          

17. That I speake, I speake it not after the Lord: but as it were foolishly, in this my great boasting.

18. Seeing that many reioyce after the flesh, I will reioyce also.

19. For ye suffer fooles gladly, because that yee are wise.

20. 
          

21. I speak as concerning 

22. They are Hebrues, so am I: they are Israelites, so am I: they are the seede of Abraham, so am I:

23. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am]

26. In iourneying I was often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine owne nation, in perils among the Gentiles, in perils in the citie, in perils in wildernes, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren,

29. Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not?

30. 
          

31. The God, euen the Father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, which is blessed for euermore, knoweth that I lie not.

32. In Damascus the gouernour of the people vnder King Aretas, layde watch in the citie of the Damascens, and would haue caught me.

33. But at a windowe was I let downe in a basket through the wall, and escaped his handes.

6. For though I woulde reioyce, I should not be a foole, for I will say the trueth: but I refraine, lest any man should thinke of me aboue that hee seeth in me, or that he heareth of me.

7. 
          

8. For this thing I besought the Lord 

9. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. 

10. Therefore I take

14. Behold, the thirde time I am ready to come vnto you, and yet will I not be slouthfull to your hinderance: for I seeke not yours, but you: for the children ought not to laye vp for the fathers, but the fathers for the children.

15. And I will most gladly bestow, and will be bestowed for your soules: though the more I loue you, the lesse I am loued.

16. 
          

17. Did I pill you by any of them whom I sent vnto you?

18. I haue desired Titus, and with him I haue sent a brother: did Titus pill you of any thing? walked we not in the selfe same spirit? walked we not in the same steppes?

19. 
          

20. 
          

21. I feare least when I come againe, my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many of them which haue sinned already, and haue not repented of the vncleannesse, and fornication, and wantonnesse which they haue committed.

## 2 Corinthians 13

1. Lo this is the thirde time that I come vnto you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall euery worde stand
