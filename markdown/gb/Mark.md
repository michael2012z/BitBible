## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, the Sonne of God:

2. 
          

3. The voyce of him that cryeth in the wildernesse is, Prepare the way of the Lord: make his paths straight.

4. 
          

5. And al ye countrey of Iudea, & they of Hierusalem went out vnto him, and were all baptized of him in the riuer Iordan, confessing their sinnes.

6. Nowe Iohn was clothed with camels heare, and with a girdle of a skinne about his loynes: and he did eate Locusts and wilde hony,

7. 
          

8. I indeed have 

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am 

12. 
          

13. And he was there in the wildernesse fourtie daies, and was tempted of Satan: hee was also with the wilde beastes, and the Angels ministred vnto him.

14. 
          

15. And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand: repent and beleeue the Gospel.

16. 
          

17. Then Iesus said vnto them, Folow me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.

18. And straightway they forsooke their nets, and folowed him.

19. 
          

20. And anon hee called them: and they left their father Zebedeus in the shippe with his hired seruants, and went their way after him.

21. And they went into 

22. And they were astonied at his doctrine, for he taught them as one that had authoritie, and not as the Scribes.

23. 
          

24. Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou 

25. And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him.

26. And when the unclean spirit 

27. And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned 

28. And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region 

29. 
          

30. And Symons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer, and anon they told him of her.

31. And he came and tooke her by the hand, and lifted her vp, and the feuer forsooke her by and by, and shee ministred vnto them.

32. And whe euen was come, at what time the sunne setteth, they brought to him all that were diseased, & them that were possessed with deuils.

33. And the whole citie was gathered together at the doore.

34. And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and 

35. And in the morning very early before day, Iesus arose & went out into a solitarie place, and there praied.

36. And Simon, and they that were with him, followed carefully after him.

37. And when they had found him, they sayde vnto him, All men seeke for thee.

38. And he said unto them, Let us go into the 

39. And hee preached in their Synagogues, throughout all Galile, and cast the deuils out.

40. 
          

41. And Iesus had compassion, and put foorth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I wil: be thou cleane.

42. And assone as he had spoken, immediatly ye leprosie departed fro him, & he was made cleane.

43. And after he had giue him a streight commandement, he sent him away forthwith,

44. 
          

45. But when he was departed, hee began to tel many things, and to publish the matter: so that Iesus could no more openly enter into the citie, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from euery quarter.

## Mark 2

1. And 

2. And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as 

3. And there came vnto him, that brought one sicke of the palsie, borne of foure men.

4. And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they 

5. Nowe when Iesus sawe their faith, he saide to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.

6. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and 

7. Why doeth this man speake such blasphemies? who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely?

8. And immediatly when Iesus perceiued in his spirite, that thus they reasoned with themselues, he sayde vnto them, Why reason yee these things in your hearts?

9. Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee? or to say, Arise, and take vp thy bed, and walke?

10. But that ye may knowe, that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue sinnes, (he sayde vnto the sicke of the palsie.)

11. I say vnto thee, Arise and take vp thy bed, and get thee hence into thine owne house.

12. And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all 

13. 
          

14. And as he passed by, he saw 

15. And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at table in his house, many Publicanes & sinners sate at table also with Iesus, and his disciples: for there were many that followed him.

16. And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with the Publicanes and sinners, they sayd vnto his disciples, Howe is it, that hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes and sinners?

17. Now when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole haue no neede of the Physicion, but the sicke. I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.

18. 
          

19. And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children of the marriage chamber fast, whiles the bridegrome is with them? as long as they haue the bridegrome with them, they cannot fast.

20. But the daies will come, when the bridegrome shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in those daies.

21. Also no man soweth a piece of newe cloth in an olde garment: for els the newe piece that filled it vp, taketh away somewhat from the olde, and the breach is worse.

22. Likewise, no man putteth newe wine into old vessels: for els the new wine breaketh the vessels, and the wine runneth out, and the vessels are lost: but newe wine must be put into new vessels.

23. 
          

24. And the Pharises saide vnto him, Beholde, why doe they on the Sabbath day, that which is not lawfull?

25. And he saide to them, Haue yee neuer read what Dauid did when he had neede, and was an hungred, both he, and they that were with him?

26. How he went into the house of God in the days of 

27. And hee sayde to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.

28. Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the 

## Mark 3

1. And 

2. And they watched him, whether he would heale him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.

3. Then he saide vnto the man which had the withered hand, Arise: stand forth in the middes.

4. And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save 

5. And when he had looked round about on them 

6. 
          

7. But Iesus auoided with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude followed him from Galile, and from Iudea,

8. And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] 

9. And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should 

10. For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had 

11. And 

12. And he sharply rebuked them, to the ende they should not vtter him.

13. Then hee went vp into a mountaine, and called vnto him whome he woulde, and they came vnto him.

14. 
          

15. And that they might haue power to heale sicknesses, and to cast out deuils.

16. And the first was Simon, and hee named Simon, Peter,

17. Then Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, & Iohn Iames brother (and surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sonnes of thunder,)

18. And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and 

19. And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an 

20. And the multitude assembled againe, so that they could not so much as eate bread.

21. 
          

22. And the Scribes which came downe fro Hierusalem, saide, He hath Beelzebub, & through the prince of the deuils he casteth out deuils.

23. But he called them vnto him, and said vnto them in parables, How can Satan driue out Sata?

24. For if a kingdome bee deuided against it selfe, that kingdome can not stand.

25. Or if a house bee deuided against it selfe, that house can not continue.

26. And if 

27. No man can enter into a strong mans house, and take away his goods, except hee first binde that strong man, and then spoyle his house.

28. 
          

29. But hee that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, shall neuer haue forgiuenesse, but is culpable of eternall damnation.

30. 
          

31. There came then his 

32. And the people sate about him, and they said vnto him, Beholde, thy mother, and thy brethren seeke for thee without.

33. But hee answered them, saying, Who is my mother and my brethren?

34. 
          

35. For whosoeuer doeth the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

## Mark 4

1. And he began again to teach by the 

2. And he taught them many things in parables, and said vnto them in his doctrine,

3. 
          

4. And it came to passe as he sowed, that some fell by the way side, and the foules of the heauen came, and deuoured it vp.

5. And some fell on stonie grounde, where it had not much earth, and by and by sprang vp, because it had not depth of earth.

6. But assoone as ye Sunne was vp, it was burnt vp, and because it had not roote, it withered away.

7. And some fell among the thornes, and the thornes grewe vp, and choked it, so that it gaue no fruite.

8. Some againe fell in good grounde, and did yeelde fruite that sprong vp, and grewe, and it brought foorth, some thirtie folde, some sixtie folde, and some an hundreth folde.

9. Then he said vnto them, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.

10. And when he was 

11. And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are 

12. That they seeing, may see, and not discerne: and they hearing, may heare, and not vnderstand, least at any time they should turne, and their sinnes should be forgiuen them.

13. Againe he said vnto them, Perceiue ye not this parable? howe then should ye vnderstand all other parables?

14. The sower soweth the worde.

15. And these are they that receiue the seede by the wayes side, in whome the worde is sowen: but when they haue heard it, Satan commeth immediatly, and taketh away the worde that was sowen in their heartes.

16. And likewise they that receiue the seede in stony ground, are they, which whe they haue heard the word, straightwayes receiue it with gladnesse.

17. Yet haue they no roote in themselues, and endure but a time: for when trouble and persecution ariseth for the worde, immediatly they be offended.

18. Also they that receiue the seede among the thornes, are such as heare the word:

19. And the cares 

20. But they that haue receiued seede in good ground, are they that heare the worde, and receiue it, and bring foorth fruite: one corne thirtie, another sixtie, and some an hundreth.

21. 
          

22. For there is nothing hid, that shall not be opened: neither is there a secret, but that it shall come to light.

23. If any man haue eares to heare, let him heare.

24. 
          

25. For vnto him that hath, shall it be giuen, and from him that hath not, shall be taken away, euen that he hath.

26. 
          

27. And 

28. For the earth bringeth forth fruit 

29. And assoone as the fruite sheweth it selfe, anon hee putteth in the sickle, because the haruest is come.

30. 
          

31. It is like a graine of mustarde seede, which when it is sowen in the earth, is the least of all seedes that be in the earth:

32. But after that it is sowen, it groweth vp, and is greatest of all herbes, and beareth great branches, so that the foules of heauen may builde vnder the shadow of it.

33. And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, 

34. But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he 

35. Nowe the same day when euen was come, he saide vnto them, Let vs passe ouer vnto the other side.

36. And they left the multitude, and tooke him as he was in the shippe, and there were also with him other little shippes.

37. 
          

38. And he was in the sterne asleepe on a pillow: and they awoke him, and saide to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?

39. And hee rose vp, and rebuked the winde, and saide vnto the sea, Peace, and be still. So the winde ceased, and it was a great calme.

40. And he said unto them, 

41. And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who is this, that both the winde and sea obey him?

## Mark 5

1. And 

2. And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man 

3. Who had his abiding among the graues, and no man could binde him, no not with chaines:

4. Because that when hee was often bounde with fetters and chaines, he plucked the chaines asunder, and brake the fetters in pieces, neither could any man tame him.

5. And alwayes both night and day he cryed in the mountaines, and in the graues, and strooke himselfe with stones.

6. And when he saw Iesus afarre off, he ranne, and worshipped him,

7. And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of the most high God? I 

8. (For hee saide vnto him, Come out of the man, thou vncleane spirit.)

9. And he asked him, What is thy name? and hee answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.

10. And he 

11. Now there was there nigh unto the 

12. And all ye deuils besought him, saying, Send vs into the swine, that we may enter into them.

13. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the 

14. And the swineheards fled, and told it in the citie, and in the countrey, and they came out to see what it was that was done.

15. And they came to Iesus, and sawe him that had bene possessed with the deuil, and had the legion, sit both clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afraide.

16. And they that saw it, tolde them, what was done to him that was possessed with the deuil, and concerning the swine.

17. Then they began to pray him, that hee would depart from their coastes.

18. And when he was come into the shippe, he that had bene possessed with the deuil, prayed him that he might be with him.

19. Howbeit, Iesus would not suffer him, but said vnto him, Goe thy way home to thy friendes, and shewe them what great thinges the Lorde hath done vnto thee, and howe hee hath had compassion on thee.

20. So he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis, what great things Iesus had done vnto him: and all men did marueile.

21. And when Iesus was come ouer againe by ship vnto the other side, a great multitude gathered together to him, & he was neere vnto the sea.

22. And, 

23. And besought him instantly, saying, My litle daughter lyeth at point of death: I pray thee that thou wouldest come and lay thine hands on her, that she may be healed, and liue.

24. Then hee went with him, and a great multitude folowed him, and thronged him.

25. 
          

26. And had suffred many things of many physicions, and had spent all that she had, and it auailed her nothing, but she became much worse.

27. When she had heard of Iesus, shee came in the preasse behinde, and touched his garment.

28. For she said, If I may but touch his clothes, I shalbe whole.

29. And straightway the course of her blood was dried vp, and she felt in her body, that she was healed of that plague.

30. And immediatly when Iesus did knowe in himselfe the vertue that went out of him, he turned him round about in the preasse, and said, Who hath touched my clothes?

31. And his disciples said vnto him, Thou seest the multitude throng thee, and sayest thou, Who did touche me?

32. And he looked round about, to see her that had done that.

33. And the woman feared and trembled: for she knewe what was done in her, and shee came and fell downe before him, and tolde him the whole trueth.

34. And hee saide to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.)

35. While hee yet spake, there came from the same ruler of the Synagogues house certaine which said, Thy daughter is dead: why diseasest thou the Master any further?

36. 
          

37. And he suffered no man to folow him saue Peter and Iames, and Iohn the brother of Iames.

38. So hee came vnto the house of the ruler of the Synagogue, and sawe the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

39. And he went in, and said vnto them, Why make ye this trouble, and weepe? the childe is not dead, but sleepeth.

40. 
          

41. And tooke the childe by the hand, & saide vnto her, Talitha cumi, which is by interpretation, Mayden, I say vnto thee, arise.

42. And straightway the mayden arose, and walked: for shee was of the age of twelue yeeres, and they were astonied out of measure.

43. And he charged them straitly that no man should knowe of it, and commaunded to giue her meate.

## Mark 6

1. And 

2. And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing [him] were astonished, saying, From whence hath this [man] these things? and what wisdom [is] this which is given unto him, that even such 

3. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his 

4. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without 

5. And he 

6. And he marueiled at their vnbeliefe, and went about by ye townes on euery side, teaching.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. But [be] shod with 

10. And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, 

11. 
          

12. And they went out, and preached, that men should amend their liues.

13. And they cast out many devils, and 

14. 
          

15. Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of 

16. But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I 

17. For Herod him selfe had sent forth, & had taken Iohn, and bound him in prison for Herodias sake, which was his brother Philippes wife, because he had maried her.

18. For Iohn sayd vnto Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to haue thy brothers wife.

19. Therefore Herodias 

20. For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him 

21. But the time being conuenient, when Herod on his birth day made a banket to his princes and captaines, and chiefe estates of Galile:

22. And when the daughter 

23. And he sware vnto her, Whatsoeuer thou shalt aske of me, I will giue it thee, euen vnto the halfe of my kingdome.

24. And 

25. Then she came in straightway with haste vnto the King, & asked, saying, I would that thou shouldest giue me euen now in a charger the head of Iohn Baptist.

26. Then the King was very sory: yet for his othes sake, and for their sakes which sate at table with him, he would not refuse her.

27. And immediately the king sent an 

28. And brought his head in a charger, and gaue it to the maide, and the maide gaue it to her mother.

29. And when his disciples heard it, they came and tooke vp his body, and put it in a tombe.

30. And the Apostles gathered themselues together to Iesus, and tolde him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.

31. 
          

32. So they went by ship out of the way into a desart place.

33. But the people sawe them when they departed, and many knewe him, and ran a foote thither out of all cities, and came thither before them, and assembled vnto him.

34. Then Iesus went out, and sawe a great multitude, and had compassion on them, because they were like sheepe which had no shepheard: and he began to teach them many things.

35. And when the day was nowe farre spent, his disciples came vnto him, saying, This is a desart place, and nowe the day is farre passed.

36. Let them depart, that they may goe into the countrey and townes about, and buy them bread: for they haue nothing to eate.

37. He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, 

38. Then he sayde vnto them, Howe many loaues haue ye? Goe and looke; when they knewe it, they sayd, Fiue, and two fishes.

39. And he commanded them to make all sit down by 

40. And they sat down in 

41. And he tooke the fiue loaues, and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen, and gaue thanks, and brake the loaues, and gaue them to his disciples to set before them, and the two fishes he deuided among them all.

42. So they did all eate, and were satisfied.

43. And they tooke vp twelue baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.

44. And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousand men.

45. 
          

46. And when he had sent 

47. And when euen was come, the ship was in the mids of the sea, and he alone on the land.

48. And he saw them troubled in rowing, (for the winde was contrary vnto them) and about the fourth watch of the night, hee came vnto them, walking vpon the sea, and would haue passed by them.

49. And when they saw him walking vpon the sea, they supposed it had bene a spirit, & cried out.

50. For they all saw him, and were sore afrayd: but anon he talked with them, & said vnto them, Be ye of good comfort: it is I, be not afrayd.

51. And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were 

52. For they 

53. And they came ouer, and went into the land of Gennesaret, and arriued.

54. 
          

55. And ran about throughout all that region round about, and began to cary hither & thither in couches all that were sicke, where they heard that he was.

56. And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched 

## Mark 7

1. Then 

2. And when they saw some of his disciples 

3. For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, 

4. And [when they come] from the 

5. Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why 

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him 

11. But yee say, If a man say to father or mother, Corban, that is, By the gift that is offered by mee, thou mayest haue profite, hee shall be free.

12. So ye suffer him no more to doe any thing for his father, or his mother,

13. Making the worde of God of none authoritie, by your tradition which ye haue ordeined: and ye doe many such like things.

14. Then he called the whole multitude vnto him, and sayd vnto them, Hearken you all vnto me, and vnderstand.

15. There is nothing without a man, that can defile him, when it entreth into him: but the things which proceede out of him, are they which defile the man.

16. If any haue eares to heare, let him heare.

17. And when hee came into an house, away from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.

18. And he sayde vnto them, What? Are ye without vnderstanding also? Doe ye not knowe that whatsoeuer thing from without entreth into a man, cannot defile him,

19. Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, 

20. Then he sayd, That which commeth out of man, that defileth man.

21. For from within, euen out of the heart of men, proceede euill thoughtes, adulteries, fornications, murthers,

22. Thefts, 

23. All these euill things come from within, and defile a man.

24. 
          

25. For a certaine woman, whose litle daughter had an vncleane spirit, heard of him, and came, and fell at his feete,

26. The woman was a 

27. But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the 

28. And she answered and said unto him, 

29. Then he said vnto her, For this saying goe thy way: the deuil is gone out of thy daughter.

30. And when shee was come home to her house, shee founde the deuill departed, and her daughter lying on the bed.

31. 
          

32. And they brought vnto him one that was deafe and stambered in his speache, and prayed him to put his hand vpon him.

33. Then hee tooke him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers in his eares, and did spit, and touched his tongue.

34. And looking vp to heauen, hee sighed, and said vnto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

35. And straightway his eares were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and hee spake plaine.

36. And he commanded them, that they should tell no man: but howe much soeuer hee forbad them, the more a great deale they published it,

37. And were beyonde measure astonied, saying, Hee hath done all thinges well: he maketh both the deafe to heare, & the domme to speake.

## Mark 8

1. In those dayes, when there was a very great multitude, and had nothing to eate, Iesus called his disciples to him, and said vnto them,

2. I haue compassion on the multitude, because they haue nowe continued with mee three dayes, and haue nothing to eate.

3. And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will 

4. Then his disciples answered him, Whence can a man satisfie these with bread here in the wildernes?

5. And hee asked them, Howe many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen.

6. Then he commaunded the multitude to sit downe on the grounde: and hee tooke the seuen loaues, and gaue thankes, brake them, and gaue to his disciples to set before them, and they did set them before the people.

7. They had also a few small fishes: and when he had giuen thankes, he commaunded them also to be set before them.

8. So they did eate, and were sufficed, and they tooke vp of the broken meate that was left, seuen baskets full.

9. (And they that had eaten, were about foure thousand) so he sent them away.

10. And anon he entred into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

11. 
          

12. And he 

13. So he left them, and went into the ship againe, and departed to the other side.

14. And they had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the shippe with them, but one loafe.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. And when Iesus knew it, he said vnto them, Why reason you thus, because ye haue no bread? perceiue ye not yet, neither vnderstande? haue ye your hearts yet hardened?

18. Haue yee eyes, and see not? and haue yee eares, and heare not? and doe ye not remember?

19. When I brake the fiue loaues among fiue thousand, how many baskets full of broken meate tooke ye vp? They said vnto him, Twelue.

20. And when I brake seuen among foure thousande, howe many baskets of the leauings of broken meate tooke ye vp? And they said, Seuen.

21. And he said unto them, 

22. 
          

23. Then he tooke the blinde by the hand, and ledde him out of the towne, and spat in his eyes, and put his handes vpon him, and asked him, if he sawe ought.

24. And he looked up, and said, I 

25. After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him 

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. And they answered, Some say, Iohn Baptist: and some, Elias: and some, one of the Prophets.

29. And he said vnto them, But whome say ye that I am? Then Peter answered, and saide vnto him, Thou art that Christ.

30. 
          

31. 
          

32. 
          

33. But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou 

34. 
          

35. For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: but whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels, he shall saue it.

36. 
          

37. Or what exchange shall a man giue for his soule?

38. For whosoeuer shall be ashamed of mee, and of my wordes among this adulterous and sinfull generation, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed also, when he commeth in the glorie of his Father with the holy Angels.

## Mark 9

1. And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the 

2. 
          

3. And his raiment 

4. And there appeared vnto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Iesus.

5. Then Peter answered, and said to Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: let vs make also three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

6. For he wist not what to say; for they were sore 

7. And there was a cloude that shadowed them, and a voyce came out of the cloude, saying, This is my beloued Sonne: heare him.

8. And suddenly they looked roud about, and sawe no more any man saue Iesus only with them.

9. 
          

10. And they 

11. 
          

12. And he answered, and said vnto them, Elias verely shall first come, and restore all things: and as it is written of the Sonne of man, hee must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

13. But I say vnto you, that Elias is come, (and they haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they would) as it is written of him.

14. 
          

15. And straightway all the people, when they behelde him, were amased, and ranne to him, and saluted him.

16. Then hee asked the Scribes, What dispute you among your selues?

17. And one of the companie answered, and said, Master, I haue brought my sonne vnto thee, which hath a dumme spirit:

18. And wheresoever he taketh him, he 

19. Then he answered him, & said, O faithlesse generation, how long now shall I be with you! how long now shall I suffer you! Bring him vnto me.

20. And they brought him unto him: and when he 

21. Then he asked his father, How long time is it since he hath bin thus? And he said, Of a childe.

22. And oft times he casteth him into the fire, & into the water to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, helpe vs, and haue compassion vpo vs.

23. Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, 

24. And straightway the father of the childe crying with teares, saide, Lorde, I beleeue: helpe my vnbeliefe.

25. When Iesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the vncleane spirit, saying vnto him, Thou domme & deafe spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, & enter no more into him.

26. 
          

27. But Iesus tooke his hande, and lift him vp, and he arose.

28. 
          

29. And he saide vnto them, This kinde can by no other meanes come foorth, but by prayer and fasting.

30. And they departed thence, and 

31. 
          

32. But they vnderstoode not that saying, and were afraide to aske him.

33. 
          

34. And they helde their peace: for by the way they reasoned among themselues, who should bee the chiefest.

35. And he sate downe, and called the twelue, and said to them, If any man desire to be first, the same shalbe last of all, and seruant vnto all.

36. And he tooke a litle childe, and set him in the middes of them, and tooke him in his armes, and sayd vnto them,

37. Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not 

38. 
          

39. But Iesus sayd, Forbid him not: for there is no man that can doe a miracle by my Name, that can lightly speake euill of me.

40. For whosoeuer is not against vs, is on our part.

41. And whosoeuer shall giue you a cup of water to drinke for my Names sake, because ye belong to Christ, verely I say vnto you, he shall not lose his rewarde.

42. 
          

43. Wherefore, if thine hand cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, then hauing two hands, to goe into hell, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched,

44. Where their 

45. Likewise, if thy foote cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to go halt into life, then hauing two feete, to be cast into hell, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched,

46. Where their worme dyeth not, & the fire neuer goeth out.

47. And if thine eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out: it is better for thee to goe into the kingdome of God with one eye, then hauing two eyes, to be cast into hell fire,

48. Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out.

49. 
          

50. Salt is good: but if the salt be vnsauerie, wherewith shall it be seasoned? haue salt in your selues, and haue peace one with another.

## Mark 10

1. And he 

2. Then the Pharises came and asked him, if it were lawfull for a man to put away his wife, and tempted him.

3. And he answered, and sayde vnto them, What did Moses commaund you?

4. And they sayd, Moses suffered to write a bill of diuorcement, and to put her away.

5. 
          

6. But at the beginning of the creation God made them male and female:

7. For this cause shall man leaue his father and mother, and cleaue vnto his wife.

8. And they twaine shalbe one flesh: so that they are no more twaine, but one flesh.

9. Therefore, what God hath coupled together, let not man separate.

10. And in the house his disciples asked him againe of that matter.

11. And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery 

12. And if a woman put away her husband, & be married to another, she committeth adulterie.

13. 
          

14. But when Iesus sawe it, he was displeased, and said to them, Suffer the litle children to come vnto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdome of God.

15. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God 

16. And he tooke them vp in his armes, and put his hands vpon them, and blessed them.

17. 
          

18. Iesus sayde to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, euen God.

19. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, 

20. Then he answered, and said to him, Master, all these things I haue obserued from my youth.

21. And Iesus looked vpon him, & loued him, and sayde vnto him, One thing is lacking vnto thee. Go and sell all that thou hast, and giue to the poore, & thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, followe me, and take vp the crosse.

22. But hee was sad at that saying, and went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions.

23. And Iesus looked round about, & sayd vnto his disciples, Howe hardly doe they that haue riches, enter into the kingdome of God!

24. And his disciples were afraide at his words. But Iesus answered againe, and sayd vnto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdome of God!

25. It is easier for a camel to goe through the eye of a needle, then for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of God.

26. And they were much more astonied, saying with themselues, Who then can be saued?

27. But Iesus looked vpon them, & sayd, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

28. 
          

29. Iesus answered, and sayd, Verely I say vnto you, there is no man that hath forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake and the Gospels,

30. But he shall receive an 

31. But many that are first, shall be last, and the last, first.

32. 
          

33. Saying, Beholde, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be deliuered vnto the hie Priests, and to the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death, and shall deliuer him to the Gentiles.

34. And they shall mocke him, and scourge him, and spit vpon him, and kill him: but the third day he shall rise againe.

35. 
          

36. And he sayd vnto them, What would ye I should doe for you?

37. And they said to him, Graunt vnto vs, that we may sit, one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy glory.

38. But Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye knowe not what ye aske. Can ye drinke of the cup that I shal drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme that I shall be baptized with?

39. And they said vnto him, We can. But Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of the cup that I shall drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme wherewith I shalbe baptized:

40. But to sit at my right hand, and at my left, is not mine to giue, but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared.

41. And when the ten heard that, they began to disdaine at Iames and Iohn.

42. 
          

43. But it shal not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, shall be your seruant.

44. And whosoeuer will be chiefe of you, shall be the seruant of all.

45. For euen the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the raunsome of many.

46. 
          

47. And when hee heard that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he began to crye, and to say, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.

48. And many rebuked him, because he should holde his peace: but hee cryed much more, O Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.

49. Then Iesus stood still, & commanded him to be called: and they called the blind, saying vnto him, Be of good comfort: arise, he calleth thee.

50. So he threwe away his cloke, and rose, and came to Iesus.

51. And Iesus answered, & said vnto him, What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And the blinde sayd vnto him, Lorde, that I may receiue sight.

52. Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Goe thy way: thy fayth hath saued thee; by and by, he receiued his sight, and folowed Iesus in the way.

## Mark 11

1. And 

2. And sayd vnto them, Goe your wayes into that towne that is ouer against you, and assoone as ye shall enter into it, ye shall finde a colte tied, whereon neuer man sate: loose him, and bring him.

3. And if any man say vnto you, Why doe ye this? Say that the Lord hath neede of him, and straightway he will send him hither.

4. And they went their way, and found a colt tyed by the doore without, in a place where two wayes met, and they loosed him.

5. Then certaine of them, that stoode there, sayd vnto them, What doe ye loosing the colt?

6. And they sayde vnto them, as Iesus had commanded them: So they let them goe.

7. And they brought the colte to Iesus, & cast their garments on him, and he sate vpon him.

8. And many spred their garments in the way: other cut downe branches off the trees, & strawed them in the way.

9. And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; 

10. 
          

11. So Iesus entred into Hierusalem, and into the Temple: and when he had looked about on all things, and now it was euening, he went forth vnto Bethania with the twelue.

12. And on the morowe when they were come out from Bethania, he was hungry.

13. 
          

14. Then Iesus answered, and sayd to it, Neuer man eate fruite of thee hereafter while the world standeth: and his disciples heard it.

15. 
          

16. And would not suffer that any man should carry [any] 

17. And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be 

18. And the Scribes and hie Priestes heard it, and sought howe to destroy him: for they feared him, because the whole multitude was astonied at his doctrine.

19. But when euen was come, Iesus went out of the citie.

20. 
          

21. Then Peter remembred, and said vnto him, Master, beholde, the figge tree which thou cursedst, is withered.

22. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have 

23. For verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall say vnto this mountaine, Be thou taken away, and cast into the sea, and shall not wauer in his heart, but shall beleeue that those things which he saieth, shal come to passe, whatsoeuer he saieth, shall be done to him.

24. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that 

25. And when 

26. For if you will not forgiue, your Father which is in heauen, will not pardon you your trespasses.

27. 
          

28. And said vnto him, By what authoritie doest thou these things? and who gaue thee this authoritie, that thou shouldest doe these things?

29. Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, I will also aske of you a certaine thing, & answere ye me, and I will tell you by what authoritie I do these things.

30. The baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men? answere me.

31. And they thought with themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he will say, Why then did ye not beleeue him?

32. 
          

33. Then they answered, and saide vnto Iesus, We cannot tell; Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Neither will I tell you by what authoritie I doe these things.

## Mark 12

1. And 

2. 
          

3. But they tooke him, and beat him, & sent him away emptie.

4. And againe he sent vnto them another seruant, and at him they cast stones, and brake his head, and sent him away shamefully handled.

5. And againe he sent another, and him they slew, & many other, beating some, & killing some.

6. Yet had he one sonne, his deare beloued: him also he sent the last vnto them, saying, They will reuerence my sonne.

7. But ye husbandmen said among themselues, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, and the inheritance shalbe ours.

8. So they tooke him, & killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

9. What shall then the Lord of the vineyard doe? He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and giue the vineyard to others.

10. Haue ye not read so much as this Scripture? The stone which the builders did refuse, is made the head of the corner.

11. This was done of the Lord, and it is marueilous in our eyes.

12. And they 

13. 
          

14. And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou 

15. Should we giue it, or should we not giue it? But he knew their hypocrisie, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a peny, that I may see it.

16. So they brought it, and he said vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said vnto him, Cesars.

17. Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Giue to Cesar the things that are Cesars, and to God, those that are Gods: & they marueiled at him.

18. 
          

19. Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die, and leaue his wife, and leaue no children, that his brother should take his wife, and rayse vp seede vnto his brother.

20. There were seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and when he died, left no issue.

21. Then the seconde tooke her, and he died, neither did he yet leaue issue, & the third likewise:

22. So those seuen had her, and left no yssue: last of all the wife died also.

23. In the resurrection then, when they shall rise againe, whose wife shall she be of them? For seuen had her to wife.

24. Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Are ye not therefore deceiued, because ye knowe not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?

25. For when they shall rise againe from the dead, neither men marry, nor wiues are married, but are as the Angels which are in heauen.

26. And as touching the dead, that they shall rise againe, haue ye not read in the booke of Moses, howe in the bush God spake vnto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob?

27. God is not ye God of the dead, but the God of the liuing. Ye are therefore greatly deceiued.

28. 
          

29. Iesus answered him, The first of all the commandements is, Heare, Israel, The Lord our God is the onely Lord.

30. Thou shalt therefore loue the Lorde thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy minde, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandement.

31. And the second is like, that is, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe. There is none other commandement greater then these.

32. Then that Scribe said vnto him, Well, Master, thou hast saide the trueth, that there is one God, and that there is none but he,

33. And to loue him with all the heart, and with all the vnderstanding, and with all the soule, and with all the strength, and to loue his neighbour as himselfe, is more then all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

34. Then when Iesus saw that he answered discreetely, he saide vnto him, Thou art not farre from the kingdome of God; no man after that durst aske him any question.

35. 
          

36. For David himself said by 

37. Then Dauid himselfe calleth him Lord: by what meanes is he then his sonne? And much people heard him gladly.

38. 
          

39. And the chiefe seates in the Synagogues, and the first roumes at feastes,

40. Which deuoure widowes houses, euen vnder a colour of long prayers. These shall receiue the greater damnation.

41. 
          

42. And there came a certaine poore widowe, & she threw in two mites, which make a quadrin.

43. Then he called vnto him his disciples, and said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, that this poore widowe hath cast more in, then all they which haue cast into the treasurie.

44. For they all did cast in of their superfluitie: but she of her pouertie did cast in all that she had, euen all her liuing.

## Mark 13

1. And 

2. Then Iesus answered and saide vnto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone vpon a stone, that shall not be throwen downe.

3. And as he sate on the mount of Oliues, ouer against the Temple, Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and Andrew asked him secretly,

4. Tell vs, when shall these things be? And what shalbe the signe when all these things shalbe fulfilled?

5. And Iesus answered them, & began to say, Take heede lest any man deceiue you.

6. For many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceiue many.

7. Furthermore when ye shall heare, of warres, & rumours of warres, be ye not troubled: for such things must needes be: but the end shall not be yet.

8. For nation shal rise against nation, & kingdome against kingdome, and there shalbe earthquakes in diuers quarters, and there shalbe famine and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorowes.

9. But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a 

10. And the Gospel must first be published among all nations.

11. But when they shall lead [you], and deliver you up, 

12. Yea, and the brother shall deliuer the brother to death, and the father the sonne, and the children shall rise against their parents, and shall cause them to die.

13. And ye shall be hated of all [men] 

14. But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, 

15. And let him that is vpon the house, not come downe into the house, neither enter therein, to fetch any thing out of his house.

16. And let him that is in the fielde, not turne backe againe to take his garment.

17. Then wo shalbe to the that are with child, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes.

18. Pray therefore that your flight be not in the winter.

19. For [in] 

20. And except that the Lorde had shortened those dayes, no flesh shoulde be saued: but for the elects sake, which he hath chosen, he hath shortened those dayes.

21. Then if any man say to you, Loe, here is Christ, or, lo, he is there, beleeue it not.

22. For false Christes shall rise, and false prophets, and shall shewe signes and wonders, to deceiue if it were possible the very elect.

23. But take ye heede: beholde, I haue shewed you all things before.

24. Moreouer in those dayes, after that tribulation, the sunne shall waxe darke, and ye moone shall not giue her light,

25. And the starres of heauen shall fall: and the powers which are in heauen, shall shake.

26. And then shall they see the Sonne of man comming in ye cloudes, with great power & glory.

27. And he shall then send his Angels, & shal gather together his elect from the foure windes, and from the vtmost part of the earth to the vtmost part of heauen.

28. Nowe learne a parable of the figge tree. When her bough is yet tender, and it bringeth foorth leaues, ye knowe that sommer is neere.

29. So in like maner, when ye see these things come to passe, knowe that the kingdom of God is neere, euen at the doores.

30. Verely I say vnto you, that this generation shall not passe, till all these things be done.

31. Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my woordes shall not passe away.

32. 
          

33. Take heede: watch, and praie: for yee knowe not when the time is.

34. For the Sonne of man is as a man going into a strange countrey, & leaueth his house, & giueth authoritie to his seruaunts, and to euery man his woorke, and commandeth the porter to watch.

35. Watch ye therefore, (for ye know not whe ye master of the house will come, at eue, or at midnight, at the cocke crowing, or in the dawning,)

36. Least if he come suddenly, he should finde you sleeping.

37. And those things that I say vnto you, I say vnto all men, Watch.

## Mark 14

1. After 

2. But they sayde, Not in the feast day, least there be any tumult among the people.

3. And when hee was in Bethania in the house of Simon the leper, as he sate at table, there came a woman hauing a boxe of oyntment of spikenarde, very costly, and shee brake the boxe, and powred it on his head.

4. 
          

5. For it might have been sold for more than 

6. But Iesus saide, Let her alone: why trouble yee her? Shee hath wrought a good worke on me.

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. Verely I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done, shalbe spoken of in remembrance of her.

10. 
          

11. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised that they woulde giue him monie: therefore he sought howe he might conueniently betraie him.

12. 
          

13. Then hee sent foorth two of his disciples, and sayde vnto them, Goe yee into the citie, and there shall a man meete you bearing a pitcher of water: followe him.

14. And whithersoeuer he goeth in, say yee to the good man of the house, The Master sayeth, Where is the lodging where I shal eate the Passeouer with my disciples?

15. And he will shew you a large 

16. So his disciples went foorth, and came to the citie, and found as he had said vnto them, and made readie the Passeouer.

17. And at euen he came with the twelue.

18. 
          

19. Then they began to be sorowful & to say to him one by one, Is it I? And another, Is it I?

20. And he answered and said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, that 

21. Truly the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe bee to that man, by whome the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had beene good for that man, if hee had neuer beene borne.

22. And as they did eate, Iesus tooke the bread, and when hee had giuen thankes, he brake it and gaue it to them, and sayde, Take, eate, this is my bodie.

23. Also he tooke the cuppe, and when he had giuen thankes, gaue it to them: and they all dranke of it.

24. And he saide vnto them, This is my blood of that newe Testament, which is shed for many.

25. Verely I say vnto you, I wil drinke no more of the fruit of ye vine vntill that day, that I drinke it newe in the kingdome of God.

26. And when they had sung a Psalme, they went out to the mount of Oliues.

27. 
          

28. But after that I am risen, I will goe into Galile before you.

29. 
          

30. Then Iesus saide vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, this day, euen in this night, before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt denie me thrise.

31. But he spake the 

32. 
          

33. And hee tooke with him Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and hee began to be troubled, and in great heauinesse,

34. And saide vnto them, My soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie here, and watch.

35. So he went forward a litle, and fell downe on the ground, and praied, that if it were possible, that houre might passe from him.

36. And he said, 

37. 
          

38. Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into tentation: the spirite in deede is ready, but the flesh is weake.

39. And againe hee went away, and praied, and spake the same wordes.

40. And he returned, & founde them a sleepe againe: for their eyes were heauie: neither knewe they what they should answere him.

41. And he came the third time, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest: it is ynough: the houre is come: beholde, the Sonne of man is deliuered into the hands of sinners.

42. Rise vp: let vs go: loe, he that betraieth me, is at hand.

43. 
          

44. And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away 

45. And assoone as hee was come, hee went straightway to him, and saide, Haile Master, and kissed him.

46. Then they laide their handes on him, and tooke him.

47. And 

48. And Iesus answered and saide to them, Ye be come out as against a thiefe with swordes, and with staues, to take me.

49. I was daily with you teaching in the Temple, and yee tooke me not: but this is done that the Scriptures should be fulfilled.

50. And they 

51. 
          

52. But he left his linnen cloth, and fled from them naked.

53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were 

54. And Peter folowed him afarre off, euen into the hall of the hie Priest, and sate with the seruants, and warmed himselfe at the fire.

55. 
          

56. For many bare false witnesse against him, but their witnesse agreed not together.

57. Then there arose certaine, and bare false witnesse against him, saying,

58. We hearde him say, I will destroy this Temple made with hands, & within three daies I will builde another, made without hands.

59. But their witnesse yet agreed not together.

60. Then the hie Priest stoode vp amongst them, and asked Iesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? What is the matter that these beare witnesse against thee?

61. But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the 

62. And Iesus said, I am he, and yee shall see the Sonne of man sitte at the right hande of the power of God, and come in the clouds of heauen.

63. Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, and sayd, What haue we any more neede of witnesses?

64. Ye haue heard the blasphemie: what thinke yee? And they all condemned him to be worthie of death.

65. 
          

66. 
          

67. And when shee sawe Peter warming him selfe, shee looked on him, and sayde, Thou wast also with Iesus of Nazareth.

68. But he denied it, saying, I knowe him not, neither wot I what thou saiest. Then he went out into the porche, and the cocke crewe.

69. And 

70. But hee denied it againe: and anon after, they that stoode by, sayde againe to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art of Galile, and thy speach is like.

71. And he began to curse, and sweare, saying, I knowe not this man of whom ye speake.

72. Then the seconde time the cocke crewe, and Peter remembred the woorde that Iesus had saide vnto him, Before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt denie me thrise, and waying that with himselfe, he wept.

## Mark 15

1. And 

2. Then Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Iewes? And hee answered, and sayde vnto him, Thou sayest it.

3. And the hie Priestes accused him of many things.

4. Wherefore Pilate asked him againe, saying, Answerest thou nothing? beholde howe many things they witnesse against thee.

5. But Iesus answered no more at all, so that Pilate marueiled.

6. Now at [that] feast he 

7. Then there was one named Barabbas, which was bounde with his fellowes, that had made insurrection, who in the insurrection had committed murther.

8. And the people cried aloude, and began to desire that he woulde doe as he had euer done vnto them.

9. Then Pilate answered them, and said, Will ye that I let loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?

10. For he knewe that the hie Priestes had deliuered him of enuie.

11. But the high Priestes had moued the people to desire that he would rather deliuer Barabbas vnto them.

12. And Pilate answered, and said againe vnto them, What will ye then that I doe with him, whom ye call the King of the Iewes?

13. And they cried againe, Crucifie him.

14. Then Pilate said vnto them, But what euill hath he done? And they cryed the more feruently, Crucifie him.

15. So Pilate willing to content the people, loosed them Barabbas, & deliuered Iesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified.

16. Then the souldiers led him away into the hall, which is the common hall, and called together the whole band,

17. 
          

18. And began to salute him, saying, Haile, King of the Iewes.

19. And they smote him on the head with a reede, and spat vpon him, and bowed the knees, and did him reuerence.

20. And whe they had mocked him, they tooke the purple off him, and put his owne clothes on him, and led him out to crucifie him.

21. And they 

22. 
          

23. And they gaue him to drinke wine mingled with myrrhe: but he receiued it not.

24. 
          

25. And it was the third houre, when they crucified him.

26. And ye title of his cause was written aboue, That king of the iewes.

27. They crucified also with him two theeues, the one on ye right hand, & the other on his left.

28. Thus the Scripture was fulfilled, which sayth, And he was counted among the wicked.

29. And they that went by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Hey, thou that destroyest the Temple, & buildest it in three dayes,

30. Saue thy selfe, and come downe from the crosse.

31. Likewise also euen the hie Priests mocking, said among themselues with the Scribes, He saued other men, himselfe he cannot saue.

32. Let Christ the King of Israel nowe come downe from the crosse, that we may see, and beleeue. They also that were crucified with him, reuiled him.

33. And when the sixth hour was come, there was 

34. And at the 

35. And some of them that stoode by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

36. And one ranne, and filled a spondge full of vineger, and put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke, saying, Let him alone: let vs see if Elias will come, and take him downe.

37. And Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and gaue vp the ghost.

38. And the vaile of the Temple was rent in twaine, from the toppe to the bottome.

39. Nowe when the Centurion, which stoode ouer against him, sawe that he thus crying gaue vp the ghost, he saide, Truely this man was the Sonne of God.

40. 
          

41. Which also when he was in Galile, folowed him, and ministred vnto him, and many other women which came vp with him vnto Hierusalem.

42. And nowe when the night was come (because it was the day of the preparation that is before the Sabbath)

43. Joseph of Arimathaea, an 

44. And Pilate marueiled, if he were already dead, and called vnto him the Centurion, and asked of him whether he had bene any while dead.

45. And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion, he gaue the body to Ioseph:

46. Who bought a linnen cloth, & tooke him downe, and wrapped him in the linnen cloth, and laide him in a tombe that was hewen out of a rocke, and rolled a stone vnto the doore of the sepulchre:

47. And Marie Magdalene, and Marie Ioses mother, behelde where he should be layed.

## Mark 16

1. And when the Sabbath day was past, Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of Iames, and Salome, bought sweete oyntments, that they might come, and anoynt him.

2. Therefore early in the morning, the first day of the weeke, they came vnto the sepulchre, when the Sunne was nowe risen.

3. And they saide one to another, Who shall rolle vs away the stone from the doore of the sepulchre?

4. And when they 

5. And entering into the 

6. But he said vnto them, Be not so troubled: ye seeke Iesus of Nazareth, which hath bene crucified: he is risen, he is not here: behold the place where they put him.

7. But goe your way, and tell his disciples, and Peter, that he will goe before you into Galile: there shall ye see him, as he said vnto you.

8. And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre: for they trembled, and were amased: neither said they any thing to any man: for they were afraide.

9. 
          

10. And shee went and tolde them that had bene with him, which mourned and wept.

11. And when they heard that he was aliue, and had appeared to her, they beleeued it not.

12. 
          

13. And they went, and told it to the remnant, neither beleeued they them.

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. He that shall beleeue and be baptized, shalbe saued: but he that will not beleeue, shalbe damned.

17. And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with 

18. And shall take away serpents, and if they shall drinke any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their handes on the sicke, and they shall recouer.

19. 
          

20. And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming
