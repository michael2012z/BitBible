## Job 1

1. There was a man in the land of 

2. And he had seue sonnes, & three daughters.

3. His 

4. And his sonnes went & banketted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent, & called their three sisters to eate and to drinke with them.

5. And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and 

6. Now there was a day when the 

7. And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence 

8. And the Lord saide vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill?

9. Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for 

10. Hast not thou made 

11. But put forth thine hand now, and 

12. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath [is] in 

13. And on a day, when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,

14. There came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places,

15. And the 

16. While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The 

17. And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayd, The Caldeans set on three bands, and fell vpon the camels, and haue taken them, and haue slayne the seruantes with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.

18. While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy 

19. And behold, there came a great wind from beyonde the wildernesse, and smote the foure corners of the house, which fel vpon the children, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.

20. Then Job arose, and 

21. And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return 

22. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God 

## Job 2

1. Again there was a day when the 

2. Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lorde, and sayd, From compassing the earth to and fro, and from walking in it.

3. And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, 

4. And Satan answered the LORD, and said, 

5. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his 

6. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he [is] in thine hand; but save 

7. So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore 

8. And he took him a 

9. Then said his 

10. But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not 

11. Now when Job's three 

12. And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled 

13. So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that [his] grief was very 

## Job 3

1. After this opened 

2. And Iob cryed out, and sayd,

3. Let the day 

4. Let that day be darkness; let not God 

5. Let darkness and the 

6. Let darkenesse possesse that night, let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere, nor let it come into the count of the moneths.

7. Yea, desolate be that night, and let no ioy be in it.

8. Let them curse it that curse the day, who are 

9. Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it 

10. Because it shut not vp the dores of my mothers wombe: nor hid sorowe from mine eyes.

11. 
          

12. Why did the knees preuent me? and why did I sucke the breasts?

13. For now should I have 

14. With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built 

15. Or with the princes that had golde, and haue filled their houses with siluer.

16. Or why was I not hid, as an vntimely birth, either as infants, which haue not seene the light?

17. There the wicked 

18. [There] the 

19. There are small and great, and the seruant is free from his master.

20. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and 

21. Which long for death, and if it come not, they would euen search it more then treasures:

22. Which ioy for gladnes, and reioyce, when they can finde the graue.

23. [Why is light given] to a man whose way is 

24. For my sighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like the water.

25. For the thing which I greatly 

26. I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; 

## Job 4

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde,

2. [If] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but 

3. Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou 

4. Thy wordes haue confirmed him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the weake knees.

5. But now it is come vpon thee, and thou art grieued: it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.

6. [Is] not [this] thy 

7. Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being 

8. Even as I have seen, they that 

9. By the 

10. The roaring of the 

11. The Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray, and the Lyons whelpes are scattered abroade.

12. Now a thing was 

13. In the thoughtes of ye visions of the night, when sleepe falleth on men,

14. Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones 

15. And the wind passed before me, and made the heares of my flesh to stande vp.

16. It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image [was] before mine eyes, [there was] 

17. Shall mortal man be more 

18. Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his 

19. How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of 

20. They are destroyed from 

21. Doth not their excellency [which is] in them go away? they die, even without 

## Job 5

1. Call now, if there be any that will 

2. For 

3. I have seen the 

4. His 

5. Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the 

6. Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, 

7. Yet man is born unto 

8. I would seek unto 

9. Which 

10. Who 

11. And setteth vp on hie them that be lowe, that the sorowfull may be exalted to saluation.

12. He scattereth the deuices of the craftie: so that their handes can not accomplish that which they doe enterprise.

13. He taketh the wise in their craftinesse, and the counsel of the wicked is made foolish.

14. They meet with 

15. But he saveth the 

16. So the poor hath hope, and iniquity 

17. Beholde, blessed is the man whome God correcteth: therefore refuse not thou the chastising of the Almightie.

18. For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp: he smiteth, and his handes make whole.

19. He shall deliver thee in 

20. In famine he shal deliuer thee from death: and in battel from the power of the sworde.

21. Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue, and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it commeth.

22. At destruction and famine thou shalt 

23. For thou 

24. And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle [shall be] in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not 

25. Thou shalt perceiue also, that thy seede shalbe great, and thy posteritie as the grasse of the earth.

26. Thou shalt come to [thy] grave in 

27. Lo 

## Job 6

1. Bvt Iob answered, and said,

2. Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the 

3. For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are 

4. For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do 

5. Doth the 

6. Can that which is 

7. Such things as my soule refused to touch, as were sorowes, are my meate.

8. Oh that I might have my 

9. That is, that God would destroy me: that he would let his hand go, and cut me off.

10. Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; 

11. What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] mine 

12. Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse?

13. [Is] not my 

14. He that is in miserie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour: but men haue forsaken the feare of the Almightie.

15. My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a 

16. Which are blackish with yee, and wherein the snowe is hid.

17. But in time they are dryed vp with heate and are consumed: and when it is hote they faile out of their places,

18. Or they depart from their way and course, yea, they vanish and perish.

19. The troops of Tema 

20. But they were confounded: when they hoped, they came thither and were ashamed.

21. For now ye are 

22. Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your 

23. And deliuer me from the enemies hande, or ransome me out of the hand of tyrants?

24. Teach me, and I will 

25. How 

26. Do ye imagine to reprove 

27. Ye make your wrath to fall vpon the fatherlesse, and dig a pit for your friende.

28. Now therefore be content, 

29. Turne, I pray you, let there be none iniquitie: returne, I say, and ye shall see yet my righteousnesse in that behalfe.

30. Is there iniquitie in my tongue? doeth not my mouth feele sorowes?

## Job 7

1. [Is there] not an appointed time to man upon earth? [are not] his days also like the days of an 

2. As a seruant longeth for the shadowe, and as an hyreling looketh for the ende of his worke,

3. So am I made to possess 

4. If I layed me downe, I sayde, When shall I arise? and measuring the euening I am euen full with tossing to and fro vnto the dawning of the day.

5. My flesh is 

6. My days are swifter than 

7. Remember that my life is but a wind, and that mine eye shall not returne to see pleasure.

8. The eye that hath seene me, shall see me no more: thine eyes are vpon me, and I shall be no longer.

9. 
          

10. He shall returne no more to his house, neither shall his place knowe him any more.

11. Therefore I will not 

12. [Am] I a sea, 

13. When I say, My couch shal relieue me, and my bed shall bring comfort in my meditation,

14. Then thou scarest me 

15. So that my soul 

16. I loathe [it]; I would not live alway: 

17. What [is] man, that thou 

18. And doest visite him euery morning, and tryest him euery moment?

19. Howe long will it be yer thou depart from me? thou wilt not let me alone whiles I may swallowe my spettle.

20. I have 

21. And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I [shall] 

## Job 8

1. Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and saide,

2. How long wilt thou speak these [things]? and [how long shall] the words of thy mouth 

3. Doeth God peruert iudgement? or doeth the Almightie subuert iustice?

4. If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their

6. If thou be pure and vpright, then surely hee will awake vp vnto thee, and he wil make the habitation of thy righteousnesse prosperous.

7. Though thy beginning 

8. For 

9. (For we [are but of] 

10. Shall not they teach thee and tell thee, and vtter the wordes of their heart?

11. Can the rush 

12. Though it were in greene and not cutte downe, yet shall it wither before any other herbe.

13. So are the paths of al that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall perish.

14. Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust [shall be] a 

15. He shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand: he shal holde him fast by it, yet shall it not endure.

16. He [is] 

17. The rootes thereof are wrapped about the fountaine, and are folden about ye house of stones.

18. If he destroy him from his place, then [it] shall 

19. Behold, this [is] the joy 

20. Behold, God will not cast away an vpright man, neither will he take the wicked by the hand,

21. Till he fill thy mouth with 

22. They that hate thee, shall be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the wicked shall not remaine.

## Job 9

1. Then Iob answered, and sayd,

2. I know [it is] so of a truth: but how should man be 

3. If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a 

4. He is wise in heart, & mighty in stregth: who hath bene fierce against him & hath prospered?

5. He remoueth the mountaines, and they feele not when he ouerthroweth them in his wrath.

6. Which 

7. He commandeth the sunne, & it riseth not: hee closeth vp the starres, as vnder a signet.

8. Hee himselfe alone spreadeth out the heauens, and walketh vpon the height of the sea.

9. Which maketh 

10. He doeth great things, and vnsearcheable: yea, marueilous things without nomber.

11. Lo, he goeth 

12. Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? 

13. [If] God 

14. How much less shall I answer him, [and] choose out 

15. Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I 

16. If I 

17. For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds 

18. He wil not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitternesse.

19. If [I speak] of strength, lo, [he is] 

20. If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: 

21. Though I were perfite, yet I knowe not my soule: therefore abhorre I my life.

22. This [is] one [thing], therefore I said [it], He destroyeth the 

23. If the scourge 

24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: 

25. My dayes haue bene more swift then a post: they haue fled, and haue seene no good thing.

26. They are passed as with the most swift ships, and as the eagle that flyeth to the pray.

27. If 

28. Then I am afrayd of all my sorowes, knowing that thou wilt not iudge me innocent.

29. [If] I be wicked, why then 

30. If I wash 

31. Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own 

32. For he is not a man as I am, that I shoulde answere him, if we come together to iudgement.

33. Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, 

34. Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his feare astonish me:

35. [Then] would I speak, and not fear him; 

## Job 10

1. My soul is 

2. I will say unto God, Do not 

3. [Is it] 

4. Hast thou eyes of 

5. [Are] thy days as the 

6. That thou inquirest of mine iniquitie, and searchest out my sinne?

7. Thou knowest that I am not 

8. Thine 

9. Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as 

10. Hast thou not powred me out as milke? & turned me to cruds like cheese?

11. Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and ioyned me together with bones and sinewes.

12. Thou hast granted me life and 

13. And these [things] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know 

14. If I haue sinned, then thou wilt streightly looke vnto me, and wilt not holde mee giltlesse of mine iniquitie.

15. If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not 

16. For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself 

17. Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; 

18. Wherfore then hast thou brought me out of the wombe? Oh that I had perished, and that none eye had seene me!

19. And that I were as I had not bene, but brought from the wombe to the graue!

20. [Are] not my days few? 

21. Before I go [whence] I shall not

## Job 11

1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and sayde,

2. Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man 

3. Should men holde their peace at thy lyes? & when thou mockest others, shall none make thee ashamed?

4. For thou hast said, 

5. But, oh that God would speake and open his lippes against thee!

6. And that he would shew thee the 

7. Canst thou by searching finde out God? canst thou finde out ye Almighty to his perfection?

8. [It is] as high as heaven; what canst thou do? 

9. The measure thereof is longer then the earth, and it is broader then the sea.

10. If he cut off, and 

11. For hee knoweth vaine men, and seeth iniquitie, and him that vnderstandeth nothing.

12. For vain man would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild 

13. If thou 

14. If iniquity [be] in thine 

15. For then shalt thou lift up thy 

16. But thou shalt forget thy miserie, and remember it as waters that are past.

17. Thine age also shall appeare more cleare then the noone day: thou shalt shine and bee as the morning.

18. And thou shalt bee bolde, because there is hope: and thou shalt digge pittes, and shalt lye downe safely.

19. For when thou takest thy rest, none shal make thee afraide: yea, many shall make sute vnto thee.

20. But the eyes 

## Job 12

1. Then Iob answered, and sayde,

2. No doubt but ye [are] the people, and 

3. But I haue vnderstanding aswel as you, and am not inferior vnto you: yea, who knoweth not such things?

4. I am 

5. 
          

6. The tabernacles of robbers doe prosper, and they are in safetie, that prouoke God, whome God hath enriched with his hand.

7. But ask now the beasts, 

8. Or speake to the earth, and it shall shewe thee: or the fishes of the sea, and they shall declare vnto thee.

9. Who is ignorant of all these, but that the hande of the Lord hath made these?

10. In whose hande is the soule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all mankinde.

11. Doth not the ear 

12. With the 

13. With him is wisedome and strength: he hath counsell and vnderstanding.

14. Beholde, he will breake downe, and it can not be built: he shutteth a man vp, and he can not be loosed.

15. Beholde, he withholdeth the waters, and they drie vp: but when he sendeth them out, they destroy the earth.

16. With him [is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the 

17. He causeth the counsellers to goe as spoyled, and maketh the iudges fooles.

18. 
          

19. He leadeth away the princes as a pray, and ouerthroweth the mightie.

20. He removeth away the speech of the 

21. He powreth contempt vpon princes, and maketh the strength of the mightie weake.

22. He discouereth the deepe places from their darkenesse, and bringeth foorth the shadowe of death to light.

23. He 

24. He taketh away the heartes of the that are the chiefe ouer the people of the earth, & maketh them to wander in the wildernes out of the way.

25. They grope in the darke without light: and he maketh the to stagger like a drunken ma.

## Job 13

1. Loe, mine eye hath seene all this: mine eare hath heard, and vnderstande it.

2. I knowe also as much as you knowe: I am not inferiour vnto you.

3. Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire 

4. But ye [are] forgers of lies, ye [are] all 

5. Oh, that you woulde holde your tongue, that it might be imputed to you for wisedome!

6. Nowe heare my disputation, and giue eare to the arguments of my lips.

7. Will ye speak 

8. Will ye accept his person? or will ye contende for God?

9. Is it well that he shoulde seeke of you? will you make a lye for him, as one lyeth for a man?

10. He will surely reprooue you, if ye doe secretly accept any person.

11. Shall not his excellencie make you afraid? and his feare fall vpon you?

12. Your 

13. Holde your tongues in my presence, that I may speake, and let come vpon what will.

14. Wherefore do I 

15. Loe, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him, and I will reprooue my wayes in his sight.

16. He also [shall be] my salvation: for an 

17. Heare diligently my wordes, and marke my talke.

18. Behold now, I have ordered [my] cause; I know that I shall be 

19. Who [is] he [that] will plead 

20. But doe not these two things vnto me: then will I not hide my selfe from thee.

21. 
          

22. Then call thou, and I will answere: or let me speake, and answere thou me.

23. How many [are] 

24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and takest me for thine enemie?

25. Wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the drie stubble?

26. For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess 

27. Thou puttest my feet also in the 

28. Such one consumeth like a rotten thing, and as a garment that is motheaten.

## Job 14

1. Man 

2. He shooteth foorth as a flowre, and is cut downe: he vanisheth also as a shadowe, and continueth not.

3. And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an 

4. Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse? there is not one.

5. Are not his dayes determined? the nober of his moneths are with thee: thou hast appointed his boundes, which he can not passe.

6. Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, 

7. For there is hope of a tree, if it bee cut downe, that it will yet sproute, and the branches thereof will not cease.

8. Though the roote of it waxe olde in the earth, & the stocke thereof be dead in ye ground,

9. Yet by the sent of water it will bud, and bring foorth boughes like a plant.

10. 
          

11. As the waters passe from the sea, and as the flood decayeth and dryeth vp,

12. So man sleepeth and riseth not: for hee shall not wake againe, nor be raised from his sleepe till the heauen be no more.

13. O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy 

14. If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till 

15. Thou shalt call, and I will 

16. But nowe thou nombrest my steppes, and doest not delay my sinnes.

17. My transgression [is] sealed up in a 

18. And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the 

19. As the water breaketh the stones, when thou ouerflowest the things which growe in the dust of ye earth: so thou destroyest ye hope of man.

20. Thou preuailest alway against him, so that he passeth away: he changeth his face when thou castest him away.

21. And he knoweth not if his sonnes shall be honourable, neither shall he vnderstand concerning them, whether they shalbe of lowe degree,

## Job 15

1. Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and saide,

2. Should a wise man utter 

3. Shall he dispute with wordes not comely? or with talke that is not profitable?

4. Yea, thou castest off 

5. For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the 

6. Thine owne mouth condemneth thee, and not I, and thy lippes testifie against thee.

7. [Art] thou the 

8. Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom 

9. What knowest thou that we knowe not? and vnderstandest that is not in vs?

10. With vs are both auncient and very aged men, farre older then thy father.

11. [Are] the consolations of God 

12. Why doth thine heart 

13. That thou answerest to God at thy pleasure, and bringest such wordes out of thy mouth?

14. What [is] man, that he should be clean? and [he which is] born of a woman, that he should 

15. Beholde, he founde no stedfastnesse in his Saintes: yea, the heauens are not cleane in his sight.

16. How much more abominable and filthy [is] man, which 

17. I will tell thee: heare me, and I will declare that which I haue seene:

18. Which wise men haue tolde, as they haue heard of their fathers, and haue not kept it secret:

19. Unto whom alone the earth was 

20. The wicked man travaileth with pain all [his] days, and the number 

21. A sounde of feare is in his eares, and in his prosperitie the destroyer shall come vpon him.

22. He believeth not that he shall return out of 

23. He wandereth 

24. Trouble and 

25. For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and made him selfe strong against the Almightie.

26. Therefore God shall runne vpon him, euen vpon his necke, and against the most thicke part of his shielde.

27. Because he covereth his face with 

28. And he dwelleth 

29. He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the 

30. He shall neuer depart out of darkenesse: the flame shall drie vp his branches, and he shall goe away with the breath of his mouth.

31. Let not him that is 

32. His branch shall not be greene, but shall be cut off before his day.

5. That the reioycing of the wicked is short, and that the ioy of hypocrites is but a moment?

6. Though

20. Surely he shall feele no quietnes in his bodie, neither shall he reserue of that which he desired.

21. There shall none of his

8. Their seede is established in their sight with them, and their generation before their eyes.

9. Their houses are peaceable without feare, and the rod of God is not vpon them.

10. Their bullocke gendreth, and fayleth not: their cow calueth, and casteth not her calfe.

11. They send forth their little ones 

12. They take the tabret & harpe, and reioyce in the sound of the organs.

13. They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment 

14. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the

11. He hath put my feete in the stockes, and looketh narrowly vnto all my paths.

12. Behold, in this hast thou not done right: I will answere thee, that God is greater then man.

13. Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not

18. And keepe backe his soule from the pit, & that his life should not passe by the sword.

19. He is also striken with sorow vpon his bed, and the griefe of his bones is sore,

20. So that his 

21. His flesh faileth that it can not be seene, and his bones which were not seene, clatter.

22. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life 

23. If there be a

25. His flesh shall be 

26. He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his

28. 
          

29. Lo, all these [things] worketh God 

30. That he may turne backe his soule from the pit, to be illuminate in the light of the liuing.

31. Marke well, O Iob, and heare me: keepe silence, and I will speake.

32. If thou hast any

## Job 34

1. Moreouer Elihu answered, and saide,

2. Hear my words, O ye 

3. For the eare tryeth the words, as the mouth tasteth meate.

4. Let us choose to us 

5. For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken 

6. Should I lie against my 

7. What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up 

8. Which goeth in 

9. For he hath said, 

10. Therefore hearken vnto me, ye men of wisedome, God forbid that wickednesse should be in God, and iniquitie in the Almightie.

11. For he will render vnto man according to his worke, and cause euery one to finde according to his way.

12. And certainely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almightie peruert iudgement.

13. Whome hath he appointed ouer the earth beside him selfe? or who hath placed the whole worlde?

14. If 

15. All flesh shal perish together, and man shal returne vnto dust.

16. And if thou hast vnderstanding, heare this and hearken to the voyce of my wordes.

17. Shall even he that hateth right 

18. [Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] 

19. How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, & regardeth not the rich, more then the poore? for they be all the worke of his handes.

20. In a moment shall they die, 

21. For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goings.

22. There is no darkenesse nor shadowe of death, that the workers of iniquitie might be hid therein.

23. For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should 

24. He shall break in pieces mighty men without 

25. Therefore he knoweth their 

26. He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of 

27. Because they haue turned backe from him, and would not consider all his wayes:

28. So that they cause the cry of the poor to 

29. And when he giueth quietnesse, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who can beholde him, whether it be vpon nations, or vpon a man onely?

30. That the 

31. Surely it is meet 

32. 
          

33. [Should it be] according to 

34. Let men of vnderstanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken vnto me.

35. Iob hath not spoken of knowledge, neyther were his wordes according to wisedome.

36. My desire [is that] Job may be 

37. For he

4. I will answer thee, and thy 

5. Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the 

6. If thou sinnest, what doest thou 

7. If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him? or what receiueth he at thine hand?

8. Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousnes may profite ye sonne of man.

9. By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] 

10. But none saieth, Where is God that made me, which giueth songs in the nyght?

11. Which teacheth vs more then the beastes of the earth, and giueth vs more wisdome then the foules of the heauen.

12. There they cry, 

13. Surely God will not heare vanitie, neyther will the Almightie regard it.

14. Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, 

15. But nowe because his anger hath not visited, nor called to count the euill with great extremitie,

16. Therefore doth Job 

## Job 36

1. Elihu also proceeded and sayde,

2. Suffer me a litle, and I will instruct thee: for I haue yet to speake on Gods behalfe.

3. I will fetch 

4. For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that is 

5. Behold, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not [any: he is] 

6. He 

7. He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with 

8. And if they bee bound in fetters and tyed with the cordes of affliction,

9. Then he sheweth them their 

10. He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth them that they returne fro iniquity.

11. If they obey and serue him, they shal end their dayes in prosperity, & their yeres in pleasures.

12. But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die 

13. But the hypocrites 

14. They die in 

15. He deliuereth the poore in his affliction, & openeth their eare in trouble.

16. Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and 

17. But thou hast fulfilled the 

18. 
          

19. Wil he regard thy riches? he regardeth not golde, nor all them that excel in strength.

20. 
          

21. Take heed, regard not 

22. Beholde, God exalteth by his power: what teacher is like him?

23. Who hath appointed to him his way? or who can say, Thou hast done wickedly?

24. Remember that thou magnifie his worke, which men behold.

25. Every man may see it; man may behold [it] 

26. Behold, God [is] great, 

27. For he maketh small the drops of water: they 

28. Which raine the cloudes do droppe and let fall abundantly vpon man.

29. Also can [any] understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the noise of his 

30. Behold, he spreadeth his light upon 

31. For by them judgeth he 

32. With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh

## Job 37

1. At this also my heart

3. He directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his light vnto the endes of the world.

4. After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay 

5. God thundereth marueilously with his voyce: he worketh great things, which we know not.

6. For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth;

13. He causeth it to come, whether for

15. Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the 

16. Dost thou know the 

17. How thy garments [are]

16. Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the

18. Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? Tell if thou knowest all this.

19. Where is the way where light dwelleth? And where is the place of darkenesse,

20. That thou 

21. Knewest thou it, because thou wast then borne, and because the nomber of thy dayes is great?

22. Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snow? Or hast thou seene the treasures of ye haile,

25. Who hath deuided the spowtes for the raine? Or the way for the lightning of ye thunders,

26. To cause it to raine on the earth where no man is, and in the wildernes where there is no man?

27. To fulfil the wilde and waste place, and to cause the bud of the herbe to spring forth?

28. Who is the father of the rayne? Or who hath begotten the droppes of the dewe?

29. Out of whose wombe came the yee? Who hath ingendred the frost of the heauen?

30. The waters are hid
