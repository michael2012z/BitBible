## 2 Kings 1

1. Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 

2. And 

3. But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, 

4. Wherefore thus saith the Lorde, Thou shalt not come downe from the bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death. So Eliiah departed.

5. And the messengers returned vnto him, to whome he said, Why are ye nowe returned?

6. And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, 

7. And he saide vnto them, What maner of man was he which came and met you, and tolde you these wordes?

8. And they answered him, [He was] an 

9. Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top 

10. And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I [be] a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. 

11. Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, 

12. And Elijah answered and said unto them, 

13. And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my 

14. Beholde, there came fire downe from the heauen and deuoured the two former captaines ouer fiftie with their fifties: therefore let my life nowe be precious in thy sight.

15. And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be 

16. And he saide vnto him, Thus saith the Lorde, Because thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, (was it not because there was no God in Israel to inquire of his worde?) therefore thou shalt not come downe off the bed, on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death.

17. So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And 

18. Concerning the rest of the actes of Ahaziah, that he did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 2 Kings 2

1. And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from 

2. Then Eliiah saide to Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Bethel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came downe to Beth-el.

3. And the 

4. Againe Eliiah saide vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iericho: But he said, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.

5. And the sons of the prophets that [were] at 

6. Moreouer Eliiah saide vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iorden. But he saide, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they went both together.

7. And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went and stoode on the other side a farre off, and they two stoode by Iorden.

8. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the 

9. And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, 

10. And he saide, Thou hast asked an hard thing: yet if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt haue it so: & if not, it shal not be.

11. And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into 

12. And Elisha saw it, and he cryed, My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: and he sawe him no more: and he tooke his owne clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

13. He tooke vp also the cloke of Eliiah that fell from him, and returned, and stoode by the banke of Iorden.

14. After, he tooke the cloke of Eliiah, that fell from him, and smote the waters, and sayde, Where is the Lord God of Eliiah? And so he also, after he had striken the waters, so that they were deuided this way and that way, went ouer, euen Elisha.

15. And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The 

16. And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, 

17. Yet they were instant vpon him, til he was ashamed: wherefore he saide, Sende. So they sent fiftie men, which sought three dayes, but founde him not.

18. Therefore they returned to him, (for he taryed at Iericho) and he said vnto them, Did not I say vnto you, Goe not?

19. And the men of the citie saide vnto Elisha, Beholde, we pray thee: the situation of this citie is pleasant, as thou, my lorde, seest, but the water is naught, and the ground baren.

20. Then he saide, Bring me a newe cruse, and put salt therein; they brought it to him.

21. And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast 

22. So the waters were healed vntill this day, according to the worde of Elisha which hee had spoken.

23. And he went vp from thence vnto Beth-el; as he was going vp the way, litle children came out of the citie, and mocked him, and saide vnto him, Come vp, thou balde head, come vp, thou balde head.

24. And he turned back, and looked on them, and 

25. So he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

## 2 Kings 3

1. Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the 

2. And he wrought euill in the sight of the Lorde, but not like his father nor like his mother: for he tooke away the image of Baal that his father had made.

3. Nevertheless he cleaved unto the 

4. And 

5. But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the King of Israel.

6. Therefore King Iehoram went out of Samaria the same season, and nombred all Israel,

7. And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: 

8. Then said he, What way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way of the wildernesse of Edom.

9. So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the 

10. Therefore the King of Israel sayde, Alas, that the Lord hath called these three Kings, to giue them into the hand of Moab.

11. But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here [is] Elisha the son of Shaphat, which 

12. And Jehoshaphat said, 

13. And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, 

14. And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would 

15. But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel 

16. And he saide, Thus saith the Lorde, Make this valley full of ditches.

17. For thus saith the Lorde, Ye shall neither see winde nor see raine, yet the valley shalbe filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye and your cattel, and your beastes.

18. And this is [but] a 

19. And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and 

20. And in the morning whe the meat offring was offred, beholde, there came water by the way of Edom: and the countrey was filled with water.

21. And when al the Moabites heard that the Kings were come vp to fight against them, they gathered all that was able to put on harnesse, & vpwarde, and stood in their border.

22. And they rose earely in the morning, when the sunne arose vpon the water, and the Moabites saw the water ouer against them, as red as blood.

23. And they said, 

24. And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they 

25. And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in 

26. And when the King of Moab saw that the battel was too sore for him, he tooke with him seuen hudreth men that drew the sword, to break through vnto the King of Edom: but they could not.

27. Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and

2. And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a 

3. And he sayde, Goe, and borowe thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, emptie vessels, and spare not.

4. And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into 

5. So shee departed from him, and shut the doore vpon her, and vpon her sonnes; they brought to her, and she powred out.

6. And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, [There is] not a vessel more. And the oil 

7. Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the 

8. And on a time Elisha came to Shunem, and there a woman of great estimation constrained him to eate bread: and as he passed by, he turned in thither to eate bread.

9. And she sayde vnto her husband, Beholde, I know now, that this is an holy man of God that passeth by vs continually.

10. Let us make a 

11. And on a day, hee came thither and turned into the chamber, and lay therein,

12. And sayd to Gehazi his seruant, Call this Shunammite: and when hee called her, she stood before him.

13. And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; 

14. And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath 

15. Then said he, Cal her; hee called her, and shee stoode in the doore.

16. And he said, At this time appointed, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a sonne; she sayd, Oh my Lorde, thou man of God, doe not lye vnto thine handmayd.

17. So the woman conceiued, & bare a sonne at that same season, according to the time of life, that Elisha had sayd vnto her.

18. And when the childe was growen, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father, and to the reapers.

19. And he said unto his father, 

20. And hee tooke him & brought him to his mother, and hee sate on her knees till noone, and dyed.

21. Then shee went vp, and layed him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the doore vpon him, and went out.

22. Then she called to her husband, & sayd, Send with me, I pray thee, one of the yong men and one of the asses: for I will haste to the man of God, and come againe.

23. And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? [it is] neither 

24. Then she sadled an asse, and sayde to her seruant, Driue, and goe forward: staye not for me to get vp, except I bid thee.

25. So she went, and came vnto the man of God to mount Carmel; when the man of God sawe her ouer against him, he sayd to Gehazi his seruant, Beholde, the Shunammite.

26. Runne nowe, I say, to meete her, and say vnto her, Art thou in health? is thine husband in health? and is the child in health? And she answered, We are in health.

27. And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she 

28. Then she said, Did I desire a sonne of my lord? did I not say, Deceiue me not?

29. Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: 

30. And the mother of the childe sayde, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. Therefore he arose, and followed her.

31. But Gehazi was gone before them, & had layed the staffe vpon the face of the childe, but he neither spake nor heard: wherefore hee returned to meete him, and told him, saying, The childe is not waken.

32. Then came Elisha into the house, and beholde, the childe was dead, and layed vpon his bedde.

33. He went in therefore, and shut the doore vpon them twayne, and prayed vnto the Lord.

34. And he went up, and 

35. Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed 

36. Then he called Gehazi, and sayd, Call this Shunammite. So he called her, which came in vnto him; he said vnto her, Take thy sonne.

37. And she came, and fell at his feete, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and tooke vp her sonne, and went out.

38. And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and [there was] a dearth in the 

39. And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a 

40. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O [thou] man of God, [there is] 

41. Then he said, Bring meale; hee cast it into the potte, and sayd, Powre out for the people, that they may eate: and there was none euill in the pot.

42. Then came a man from Baal-shalisha, & brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, euen twenty loaues of barley, and full eares of corne in the huske; hee saide, Giue vnto the people, that they may eate.

43. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and 

44. So he set it before them, and they did eate, and left ouer, according to the word of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 5

1. Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given 

2. And the Aramites had gone out by bands, and had taken a litle mayde of the land of Israel, and shee serued Naamans wife.

3. And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord [were] with the 

4. And 

5. And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and 

6. And brought the letter to the King of Israel to this effect, Now when this letter is come vnto thee, vnderstand, that I haue sent thee Naaman my seruant, that thou maiest heale him of his leprosie.

7. And when the King of Israel had read the letter, he rent his clothes, and sayde, Am I God, to kil and to giue life, that hee doth send to mee, that I should heale a man from his leprosie? wherfore consider, I pray you, and see howe he seeketh a quarel against me.

8. And it was [so], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, 

9. Then Naaman came with his horses, and with his charets, and stoode at the doore of the house of Elisha.

10. And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him, saying, Go and wash thee in Iorden seuen times, and thy flesh shall come againe to thee, and thou shalt be clensed.

11. But Naaman was 

12. Are not Abanah and Pharpar, riuers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? may I not washe mee in them, and bee cleansed? so hee turned, and departed in displeasure.

13. And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, 

14. Then went he downe, and washed him selfe seuen times in Iorden, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came againe, like vnto ye flesh of a litle child, & he was cleane.

15. And hee turned againe to the man of God, hee, and all his companie, and came and stood before him, and sayd, Behold, now I knowe that there is no God in all the world, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a reward of thy seruant.

16. But he said, [As] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it]; 

17. Moreouer Naaman sayde, Shall there not be giuen to thy seruant two mules loade of this earth? for thy seruant will henceforth offer neither burnt sacrifice nor offring vnto any other god, saue vnto the Lord.

18. In this thing the LORD 

19. And he said unto him, 

20. And Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God sayde, Beholde, my master hath spared this Aramite Naaman, receiuing not those things at his hand that he brought: as the Lord liueth, I will runne after him, and take somewhat of him.

21. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him, 

22. And he answered, All is well: my master hath set me, saying, Behold, there be come to me, euen nowe from mount Ephraim two yong men of the children of the Prophets: giue them, I pray thee, a talent of siluer, & two change of garmets.

23. And Naaman saide, Yea, take two talents: and he compelled him, and bound two talents of siluer in two bagges, with two change of garments, and gaue them vnto two of his seruants, that they might beare them before him.

24. And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and 

25. Then he went in, and stoode before his master; Elisha said vnto him, Whence commest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy seruant went no whither.

26. And he said unto him, 

27. The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy 

## 2 Kings 6

1. And the children of the Prophets saide vnto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the place where we dwell with thee, is too litle for vs.

2. Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a 

3. And one said, Vouchsafe, I pray thee, to go with thy seruants, and he answered, I will goe.

4. So he went with them, & when they came to Iorden, they cut downe wood.

5. And as one was felling of a tree, the yron fell into the water: then he cryed, and said, Alas master, it was but borowed.

6. And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it] in thither; and the iron did 

7. Then he saide, Take it vp to thee; he stretched out his hand, and tooke it.

8. Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In 

9. Therefore the man of God sent vnto the King of Israel, saying, Beware thou goe not ouer to such a place: for there the Aramites are come downe.

10. And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and 

11. And the heart of the King of Aram was troubled for this thing: therefore he called his seruants and saide vnto them, Will ye not shewe me, which of vs bewrayeth our counsel to the king of Israel?

12. And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that [is] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy 

13. And he said, Goe, and espie where he is, that I may sende and fetch him; one tolde him, saying, Beholde, he is in Dothan.

14. Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a 

15. And when the seruant of the man of God arose earely to goe out, beholde, an hoste compassed the citie with horses and charets. Then his seruant sayde vnto him, Alas master, howe shall we doe?

16. And he answered, 

17. And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, 

18. And when 

19. And Elisha said unto them, This [is] not the way, neither [is] this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led 

20. And when they were come to Samaria, Elisha saide, Lorde, open their eyes that they may see; the Lorde opened their eyes, and they saw, & beholde, they were in the mids of Samaria.

21. And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, 

22. And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: doest thou not smite them that thou hast taken with thy sworde, and with thy bowe? but set bread and water before them, that they may eate and drinke and goe to their master.

23. And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no 

24. But afterward Ben-hadad King of Aram gathered all his hoste, and went vp, and besieged Samaria.

25. And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was [sold] for fourscore [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's 

26. And as the King of Israel was going vpon the wall, there cryed a woman vnto him, saying, Helpe, my lord, O King.

27. And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the 

28. Also the King said vnto her, What ayleth thee? And she answered, This woman sayde vnto me, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him to day, and we will eate my sonne to morowe,

29. So we sod my sonne, and did eate him: & I saide to her the day after, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him, but she hath hid her sonne.

30. And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth within 

31. And he saide, God doe so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the sonne of Shaphat shall stande on him this day.

32. But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a

1. Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, 

2. Then a lord on whose hand the king

4. If we say, We will enter into the citie, the famine is in the citie, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, we dye also. Nowe therefore come, and let vs fall into the campe of the Aramites: if they saue our liues, we shall liue: and if they kill vs, we are but dead.

5. So they rose vp in the twilight, to goe to the campe of the Aramites: and when they were come to the vtmost part of the campe of the Aramites, loe, there was no man there.

6. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a 

7. Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it [was], and 

8. And when these lepers came to the vtmost part of the campe, they entred into one tent, and did eate and drinke, and caryed thence siluer and golde, and raiment, and went and hid it: after they returned, and entred into another tent, and caryed thence also, and went and hid it.

9. Then saide one to another, We doe not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we holde our peace. If we tary till day light, some mischiefe will come vpon vs. Nowe therefore, come, let vs goe, and tell the Kings housholde.

10. So they came, and called vnto the porters of the citie, and tolde them, saying, We came to the campe of the Aramites, and loe, there was no man there, neither voyce of man, but horses tyed and asses tyed: and the tents are as they were.

11. And the porters cryed and declared to the Kings house within.

12. And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, 

13. And one of his servants answered and said, Let [some] take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the 

14. So they tooke two charets of horses, and the King sent after the hoste of the Aramites, saying, Goe and see.

15. And they went after them vnto Iorden, and loe, all the way was full of clothes and vessels which the Aramites had cast from them in their hast: & the messengers returned, and told ye King.

16. And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, 

17. And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people 

18. And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the King, saying, Two measures of barley at a shekel, and a measure of fine floure shall be at a shekel, to morowe about this time in the gate of Samaria.

19. But the prince had answered the man of God, and saide, Though the Lorde would make windowes in the heauen, coulde it come so to passe? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eate thereof.

20. And so it came vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he dyed.

## 2 Kings 8

1. Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou 

2. And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God, and went both shee and her housholde and soiourned in the lande of the Philistims seuen yeeres.

3. And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth 

4. And the King talked with Gehazi the seruant of the man of God, saying, Tell mee, I pray thee, all the great actes, that Elisha hath done.

5. And it came to pass, as he was telling 

6. And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the 

7. Then Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-hadad the King of Aram was sicke, and one told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.

8. And the king sayd vnto Hazael, Take a present in thine hande, and goe meete the man of God, that thou mayest inquire of ye Lord by him, saying, Shall I recouer of this disease?

9. So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every 

10. And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly 

11. And hee looked vpon him stedfastly, till Hazael was ashamed, and the man of God wept.

12. And Hazael sayde, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I knowe the euill that thou shalt do vnto the children of Israel: for their strong cities shalt thou set on fire, and their yong men shalt thou slay with the sworde, and shalt dash their infantes against the stones, and rent in pieces their women with child.

13. And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant 

14. So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What saide Elisha to thee? And he answered, Hee tolde mee that thou shouldest recouer.

15. And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped [it] in water, and 

16. And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah, 

17. He was two and thirtie yere olde, when he began to reigne: and hee reigned eight yeere in Ierusalem.

18. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the 

19. Yet the Lord would not destroy Iudah, for Dauid his seruants sake, as he had promised him to giue him a light, and to his children for euer.

20. In his days Edom 

21. Therefore Ioram went to Zair, and all his charets with him, and he arose by night, & smote the Edomites which were about him with the captains of the charets, and the people fled into their tents.

1. And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, 

2. And when thou commest thither, looke where is Iehu ye sonne of Iehoshaphat, the sonne of Nimshi, and go, and make him arise vp from among his brethren, and leade him to a secret chamber.

3. Then take the boxe of oyle and powre it on his head, and say, Thus sayth the Lorde, I haue anointed thee for King ouer Israel. Then open the doore, and flee without any tarying.

4. So the seruat of ye Prophet gate him to Ramoth Gilead.

5. And when he came in, behold, the captaines of the armie were sitting; he sayde, I haue a message to thee, O captaine; Iehu sayd, Vnto which of all vs? And he answered, To thee, O captaine.

6. And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have 

7. And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may auenge the blood of my seruants the Prophets, and the blood of al the seruants of the Lord of the hand of Iezebel.

8. For the whole house of Ahab shalbe destroied: and I will cut off from Ahab, him that maketh water against the wall, as well him that is shut vp, as him that is left in Israel.

9. And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah.

10. And the dogges shall eate Iezebel in the fielde of Izreel, and there shalbe none to burie her; he opened the doore, and fled.

11. Then Jehu came forth to the 

12. And they sayde, It is false, tell vs it nowe. Then he sayd, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saieth the Lorde, I haue anointed thee for King ouer Israel.

13. Then they made haste, and tooke euerie man his garment, and put it vnder him on the top of the staires, and blewe the trumpet, saying, Iehu is King.

14. So Iehu ye sonne of Iehoshaphat the sonne of Nimshi conspired against Ioram: (Now Ioram kept Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael King of Aram.

15. And King Ioram returned to bee healed in Izreel of the woundes, which the Aramites had giuen him, when hee fought with Hazael King of Aram) and Iehu sayde, If it be your mindes, let no man depart and escape out of the citie, to goe and tell in Izreel.

16. So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And 

17. And the watchman that stoode in the towre in Izreel spyed the companie of Iehu as hee came, & sayd, I see a companie; Iehoram said, Take a horseman and send to meete them, that hee may say, Is it peace?

18. So there went one on horseback to meete him, and sayde, Thus sayth the King, Is it peace? And Iehu sayd, What hast thou to do with peace? Turne behinde me; the watchman tolde, saying, The messenger came to them, but he commeth not againe.

19. Then hee sent out another on horsebacke, which came to them, and sayde, Thus sayth the King, Is it peace? And Iehu answered, What hast thou to doe with peace? turne behinde me.

20. And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving [is] like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth 

21. Then Iehoram sayd, Make ready: and his charet was made ready; Iehoram King of Israel and Ahaziah King of Iudah went out eyther of them in his charet against Iehu, and met him in the fielde of Naboth the Izreelite.

22. And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, [Is it] 

23. Then Iehoram turned his hand, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, O Ahaziah, there is treason.

24. But Iehu tooke a bowe in his hande, and smote Iehoram betweene the shoulders, that the arowe went through his heart: and he fell downe in his charet.

25. Then said Iehu to Bidkar a captaine, Take, and cast him in some place of the fielde of Naboth the Izreelite: for I remember that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lorde layed this burden vpon him.

26. Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his 

27. But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw [this], he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the going up to Gur, which [is] by Ibleam. And he fled to 

28. And his seruants caried him in a charet to Ierusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the citie of Dauid.

29. And in the

31. And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, [Had]

33. And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: 

34. And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed [woman], and bury her: for she [is] a 

35. And they went to burie her, but they foud no more of her, then the skull and the feete, and the palmes of her handes.

36. Wherefore they came agayne and tolde him; he said, This is the worde of the Lorde, which he spake by his seruant Eliiah the Tishbite, saying, In the fielde of Izreel shall ye dogs eate the flesh of Iezebel.

37. And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; [so] that they shall not say,

2. Nowe when this letter commeth to you, (for ye haue with you your masters sonnes, yee haue with you both charets and horses, and a defenced citie, and armour)

3. Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and 

4. But they were exceedingly afraid, and saide, Behold two Kings coulde not stande before him, how shall we then stand?

5. And he that was gouernour of Ahabs house, and he that ruled the citie, and the Elders, & the bringers vp of the children sent to Iehu, saying, We are thy seruants, and will doe all that thou shalt bid vs: we will make no King: do what seemeth good to thee.

6. Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye [be] mine, and [if] ye will hearken unto my voice, 

7. And when the letter came to them, they tooke the Kings sonnes, and slewe the seuentie persons, and layde their heads in baskets, and sent them vnto him to Izreel.

8. Then there came a messenger and tolde him, saying, They haue brought the heads of the Kings sonnes; he sayd, Let them lay them on two heapes at the entring in of the gate vntil the morning.

9. And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye [be] 

10. Knowe nowe that there shal fall vnto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the Lorde hath brought to passe the things that hee spake by his seruant Eliiah.

11. So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his 

12. And he arose, and departed and came to Samaria. And as Iehu was in the way by an house where the shepheards did shere,

13. He met with the brethre of Ahaziah king of Iudah, and sayd, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah, and goe downe to salute the children of the King and the children of the Queene.

14. And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, [even] two and forty men; 

15. And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him: and he 

16. And he sayde, Come with me, and see the zeale that I haue for the Lord: so they made him ride in his charet.

17. And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained vnto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the worde of the Lord, which he spake to Eliiah.

18. And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served 

19. Now therefore call vnto me all ye prophets of Baal, all his seruants, & all his priests, & let not a man be lacking: for I haue a great sacrifice for Baal: whosoeuer is lacking, he shal not liue. But Iehu did it by a subtiltie to destroy ye seruats of Baal.

20. And Iehu sayd, Proclaime a solemne assemblie for Baal; they proclaimed it.

21. So Iehu sent vnto all Israel, and all the seruants of Baal came, and there was not a man left that came not; they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was full from ende to ende.

22. Then he said vnto him that had the charge of the vestrie, Bring forth vestments for al the seruants of Baal; he brought the out vestments.

23. And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the 

24. And when they went in to make sacrifice and burnt offering, Iehu appoynted foure score men without, and sayd, If any of the men whome I haue brought into your hands, escape, his soule shalbe for his soule.

25. And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, [and] slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast [them] out, and went to the 

26. And they brought out the images of the temple of Baal, and burnt them.

27. And they destroyed the image of Baal, and threwe downe the house of Baal, & made a iakes of it vnto this day.

28. So Iehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

29. But fro the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat which made Israel to sinne, Iehu departed not fro them, neither from the golden calues that were in Beth-el and that were in Dan.

30. And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing [that which is] right in mine eyes, [and] hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that [was] in mine heart, thy 

31. But Iehu regarded not to walke in the law of the Lorde God of Israel with all his heart: for hee departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, which made Israel to sinne.

32. In those dayes the Lorde began to lothe Israel, and Hazael smote them in all the coastes of Israel,

33. From Iorden Eastward, euen all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, & them that were of Manasseh, from Aroer (which is by the riuer Arnon) and Gilead and Bashan.

34. Concerning the rest of the actes of Iehu, and all that he did, and all his valiant deedes, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

35. And Iehu slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in Samaria, and Iehoahaz his sonne reigned in his stead.

36. Concerning the rest of the acts of Iotham, and all that hee did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah?

## 2 Kings 16

1. In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah 

2. Twentie yeere olde was Ahaz, when hee began to reigne, and he reigned sixteene yeere in Ierusalem, and did not vprightly in the sight of the Lord his God, like Dauid his father:

3. But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to 

4. Also he offred and burnt incense in the hie places & on the hilles, & vnder euery greene tree.

5. Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome 

6. At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered 

7. So Ahaz sent 

8. And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the

10. And King Ahaz went vnto Damascus to meete Tiglath Pileser King of Asshur: and when King Ahaz sawe the altar that was at Damascus, he sent to Vriiah the Priest the paterne of the altar, and the facion of it, and all the workemanship thereof.

11. And Urijah the priest built an altar 

12. And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered 

13. And hee burnt his burnt offering, and his meate offring, and powred his drinke offring, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offrings besides the altar,

14. And he brought also the brasen altar, which [was] before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the 

15. And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the 

16. And Vriiah the Priest did according to all that King Ahaz had commanded.

17. And King Ahaz brake the borders of the bases, and tooke the caldrons from off them, and tooke downe the sea from the brasen oxen that were vnder it, and put it vpon a pauement of stones.

18. And the 

19. Concerning the rest of the actes of Ahaz, which he did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah?

20. And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buryed with his fathers in the citie of Dauid, and Hezekiah his sonne reigned in his steade.

## 2 Kings 17

1. In the twelft yeere of Ahaz King of Iudah began Hoshea the sonne of Elah to reigne in Samaria ouer Israel, and reigned nine yeeres.

2. And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, 

3. And Shalmaneser king of Asshur came vp against him, and Hoshea became his seruant, and gaue him presents.

4. And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, 

5. Then the king of Asshur came vp throughout all the lande, and went against Samaria, and besieged it three yeere.

6. In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor [by] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the 

7. For [so] it was, that the children of Israel had 

8. And walked according to the facions of the Heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel, and after the maners of the Kings of Israel, which they vsed,

9. And the children of Israel did secretly [those] things that [were] not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower 

10. And had made them images and groues vpon euery hie hill, and vnder euery greene tree,

11. And there burnt incense in all the hie places, as did the heathen, whom the Lord had taken away before them, and wrought wicked things to anger the Lord,

12. And serued idoles: whereof the Lorde had sayd vnto them, Ye shal do no such thing,

13. Notwithstanding the Lord testified to Israel, and to Iudah by all the Prophets, & by all the Seers, saying, Turne from your euill wayes, and keepe my commandements & my statutes, according to all the Lawe, which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my seruants the Prophets.

14. Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their 

15. And they refused his statutes and his couenant, that he made with their fathers, & his testimonies (wherewith he witnessed vnto them) and they followed vanitie, and became vaine, and followed the heathen that were round about them: concerning whome the Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them.

16. And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, [even] two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the 

17. And they caused their sons and their daughters to 

18. Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah 

19. Yet Iudah kept not the commandements of the Lord their God, but walked according to the facion of Israel, which they vsed.

20. And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his 

21. 
          

22. For the children of Israel walked in all the sinnes of Ieroboam, which he did, and departed not therefrom,

23. Vntill the Lord put Israel away out of his sight, as he had said by all his seruants the Prophets, and caryed Israel away out of their land to Asshur vnto this day.

24. And the king of Assyria brought [men] from Babylon, and from 

25. And [so] it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, [that] they 

26. Wherefore they spake to the King of Asshur, saying, The nations which thou hast remoued, and placed in the cities of Samaria, knowe not the maner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they knowe not the maner of the God of the land.

27. Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God 

28. So one of the Priestes, which they had caryed from Samaria, came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they shoulde feare the Lorde.

29. Howbeit euery nation made their gods, & put them in the houses of the hie places, which the Samaritanes had made, euery nation in their cities, wherein they dwelt.

30. And the men of Babylon made 

31. And the Auims made Nibhaz, and Tartak: and the Sepharuims burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech, and Anammelech the gods of Sepharuaim.

32. Thus they feared the Lorde, and appoynted out Priestes out of them selues for the hie places, who prepared for them sacrifices in the houses of the hie places.

33. They 

34. Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after 

35. And with whom the Lord had made a couenant, and charged them, saying, Feare none other gods, nor bowe your selues to them, nor serue them, nor sacrifice to them:

36. But feare the Lorde which brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power, and a stretched out arme: him feare ye, and worshippe him, and sacrifice to him.

37. Also keepe ye diligently the statutes and the ordinances, and the Lawe, and the commandement, which he wrote for you, that ye do them continually, and feare not other gods.

38. And forget not the couenant that I haue made with you, neither feare ye other gods,

39. But feare the Lord your God, and he will deliuer you out of the handes of all your enemies.

40. Howbeit they obeyed not, but did after their olde custome.

41. So these 

## 2 Kings 18

1. Now in the third yeere of Hoshea, sonne of Elah King of Israel, Hezekiah the sonne of Ahaz king of Iudah began to reigne.

2. He was fiue and twentie yeere olde when he began to reigne, and reigned nine and twenty yeere in Ierusalem. His mothers name also was Abi the daughter of Zachariah,

3. And he did [that which was] 

4. He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it 

5. He trusted in the Lorde God of Israel: so that after him was none like him among all the Kings of Iudah, neither were there any such before him.

6. For he claue to the Lord, and departed not from him, but kept his commaundements, which the Lord had commaunded Moses.

7. So the Lord was with him, and he prospered in all thinges, which he tooke in hande: also he rebelled against the King of Asshur, and serued him not.

8. He smote the Philistines, [even] unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, 

9. And in the fourth yere of King Hezekiah, (which was the seuenth yeere of Hoshea sonne of Elah King of Israel) Shalmaneser King of Asshur came vp against Samaria, and besieged it.

10. And after three yeeres they tooke it, euen in the sixt yeere of Hezekiah: that is, the ninth yeere of Hoshea King of Israel was Samaria taken.

11. Then the King of Asshur did carry away Israel vnto Asshur, and put them in Halah and in Habor, by the riuer of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,

12. Because they woulde not obey the voyce of the Lord their God, but transgressed his couenant: that is, all that Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded, and would neyther obey nor doe them.

13. Moreouer, in the fourteenth yeere of King Hezekiah, Saneherib King of Asshur came vp against all the strong cities of Iudah, and tooke them.

14. And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, 

15. Therefore Hezekiah gaue all the siluer that was found in the house of the Lorde, and in the treasures of the Kings house.

16. At the same season did Hezekiah pul off the plates of the doores of the Temple of the Lord, and the pillars (which the sayd Hezekiah King of Iudah had couered ouer) and gaue them to the King of Asshur.

17. And the king of Assyria sent 

18. And called to the King. Then came out to them Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, which was steward of the house, and Shebnah the chanceller, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder.

19. And Rabshakeh sayde vnto them, Tell ye Hezekiah, I pray you, Thus saith the great King, euen the great King of Asshur, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?

20. Thou sayest, (but [they are but] vain words,) [I have] 

21. Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, [even] upon 

22. But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: [is] not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath 

23. Now therefore, I pray thee, give 

24. For how canst thou despise any captaine of the least of my masters seruants, and put thy trust on Egypt for charets and horsemen?

25. Am I now come up without the 

26. Then Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Ioah said vnto Rabshakeh, Speake I pray thee, to thy seruants in the Aramites language, for we vnderstand it, and talke not with vs in the Iewes tongue, in the audience of the people that are on the wall.

27. But Rabshakeh saide vnto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master & to thee to speake these words, and not to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eate their owne doung, and drinke their owne pisse with you?

28. So Rabshakeh stoode and cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes language, and spake, saying, Heare the wordes of the great King, of the king of Asshur.

29. Thus sayth the King, Let not Hezekiah deceiue you: for he shall not be able to deliuer you out of mine hand.

30. Neither let Hezekiah make you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliuer vs, and this citie shall not be giuen ouer into the hand of the king of Asshur.

31. Hearken not vnto Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Asshur, Make appointment with me, and come out to me, that euery man may eate of his owne vine, & euery man of his owne figge tree, and drinke euery man of the water of his owne well,

32. Until 

33. Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered his lande out of the hand of the King of Asshur?

34. Where is the god of Hamah, and of Arpad? where is the god of Sepharuaim, Hena and Iuah? how haue they deliuered Samaria out of mine hand?

35. Who [are] they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the 

36. But the people helde their peace, and answered not him a worde: for the Kings commandement was, saying, Answere ye him not.

37. Then Eliakim, the sonne of Hilkiah which was steward of the house, and Shebnah the chanceller, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and tolde him the wordes of Rabshakeh.

## 2 Kings 19

1. And when King Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes and put on sackecloth, and came into the house of the Lord,

2. And he sent Eliakim, which [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, 

3. And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day [is] a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to

6. And Isaiah said vnto them, So shall ye say to your master, Thus sayeth the Lorde, Be not afraide of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the seruants of the king of Asshur haue blasphemed me.

7. Behold, I will send a blast 

8. So Rabshakeh returned, and founde the King of Asshur fighting against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

9. And when 

10. Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy

12. Haue the gods of the heathen deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed? as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden, which were in Thelasar?

13. Where is the King of Hamath, & the King of Arpad, and the King of the citie of Shepharuaim, Hena and Iuah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the 

15. And Hezekiah 

16. LORD, 

17. Trueth it is, Lord, that the Kings of Asshur haue destroyed the nations and their landes,

18. And haue set fire on their gods: for they were no gods, but the worke of mans hands, euen wood and stone: therefore they destroyed them.

19. Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the

21. This [is] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The 

22. Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] 

23. By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, [and] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the

25. Hast thou not heard long ago [how] I have done it, [and] of ancient times that I have formed it? 

26. Therefore their

28. Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my

33. But he shall returne the way he came, and shall not come into this citie, saith the Lorde.

34. For I will defende this citie to saue it for mine owne sake, and for Dauid my seruants sake.

35. And the same night the Angell of the Lorde went out and smote in the campe of Asshur an hundreth foure score and fiue thousande: so when they rose earely in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

36. So Saneherib King of Asshur departed, & went his way, and returned, & dwelt in Nineueh.

1. Manasseh was twelue yeere olde when he began to reigne, and reigned fiftie and fiue yeere in Ierusalem: his mothers name also was Hephzi-bah.

2. And he did euill in the sight of the Lorde after the abomination of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.

3. For he went backe and built the hie places, which Hezekiah his father had destroyed: and he erected vp altars for Baal, and made a groue, as did Ahab King of Israel, and worshipped all the hoste of heauen and serued them.

4. Also he built altars in the house of the Lorde, of the which the Lorde saide, In Ierusalem will I put my Name.
