## Ezekiel 1

1. Now it came to pass in the 

2. In the fift day of the moneth (which was the fift yere of King Ioiachins captiuitie)

3. The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the 

4. And I looked, and, behold, a 

5. Also from the midst of it [came] the likeness of 

6. And euery one had foure faces, and euery one had foure wings.

7. And their feete were streight feete, and the sole of their feete was like the sole of a calues foote, and they sparkled like the appearance of bright brasse.

8. And the handes of a man came out from vnder their wings in the foure parts of them, & they foure had their faces, and their wings.

9. Their wings [were] 

10. As for the likeness of their faces, they four had 

11. Thus were their faces: but their wings were spred out aboue: two wings of euery one were ioined one to another, & two couered their bodies.

12. And euery one went streight forward: they went whither their spirit led them, and they returned not when they went forth.

13. The similitude also of the beasts, and their appearance was like burning coles of fire, & like the appearance of lampes: for the fire ran among the beastes, and the fire gaue a glister, and out of the fire there went lightning.

14. And the living beings ran and 

15. Nowe as I behelde the beastes, beholde, a wheele appeared vpon the earth by the beastes, hauing foure faces.

16. The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like the colour of a 

17. Whe they went, they went vpo their foure sides, and they returned not when they went.

18. They had also rings, and height, and were fearefull to beholde, and their rings were full of eyes, round about them foure.

19. And when the beastes went, the wheeles went with them: and when the beasts were lift vp from the earth, the wheeles were lift vp.

20. Whither the spirit led them, they went, & thither did the spirite of the wheeles leade them, and the wheeles were lifted vp besides them: for the spirit of the beastes was in the wheeles.

21. When the beastes went, they went, & when they stoode, they stoode, and when they were lifted vp from the earth, the wheeles were lifted vp besides them: for the spirite of the beastes was in the wheeles.

22. And the similitude of the firmament vpon the heads of the beasts was wonderfull, like vnto chrystall, spred ouer their heads aboue.

23. And vnder the firmament were their wings streight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which couered the, and euery one had two, which couered their bodies.

24. And when they went, I heard the noise of their 

25. And there was a voyce fro the firmament, that was ouer their heads, when they stoode, and had let downe their wings.

26. And aboue the firmament that was ouer their heads, was the facion of a throne like vnto a saphir stone, and vpon the similitude of the throne was by appearance, as the similitude of a man aboue vpon it.

27. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire 

28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness around. This [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw [it], I fell 

## Ezekiel 2

1. And 

2. 
          

3. And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: for they and their fathers haue rebelled against me, euen vnto this very day.

4. For they are impudent children, and stiffe hearted: I do send thee vnto them, & thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God.

5. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that 

6. And thou, son of man, 

7. Therefore thou shalt speake my words vnto them: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease: for they are rebellious.

8. But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and 

9. And when I looked vp, beholde, an hande was sent vnto me, and loe, a roule of a booke was therein.

10. And he spread it before me; and it [was] written within and without: and [there was] written in it 

## Ezekiel 3

1. Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; 

2. So I opened my mouth, and he gaue mee this roule to eate.

3. And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, cause thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I giue thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth as sweete as honie.

4. And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, and enter into the house of Israel, and declare them my wordes.

5. For thou art not sent to a people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an hard language, but to the house of Israel,

6. Not to many people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an harde language, whose wordes thou canst not vnderstand: yet if I should sende thee to them, they would obey thee.

7. But the house of Israel will not obey thee: for they will not obey me: yea, all the house of Israel are impudent and stiffe hearted.

8. Behold, I have made thy 

9. I haue made thy forehead as the adamant, and harder then the flint: feare them not therefore, neither be afraid at their lookes: for they are a rebellious house.

10. Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee 

11. And goe and enter to them that are led away captiues vnto the children of thy people, and speake vnto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease.

12. Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying], 

13. I heard also the noyse of the wings of the beasts, that touched one another, and the ratling of the wheeles that were by them, euen a noyse of a great russhing.

14. So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I 

15. Then I came to them of the captivity at 

16. And at the ende of seuen dayes, the worde of the Lorde came againe vnto me, saying,

17. Son of man, I have made thee a 

18. When I shall say vnto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest not him warning, nor speakest to admonish the wicked of his wicked way, that he may liue, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at thine hande.

19. Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule.

20. Again, When a 

21. Neuerthelesse, if thou admonish that righteous man, that the righteous sinne not, and that he doeth not sinne, he shall liue because he is admonished: also thou hast deliuered thy soule.

22. And the 

23. Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the 

24. Then the spirit entered into me, and 

25. But thou, O sonne of man, beholde, they shall put bandes vpon thee, and shall binde thee with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them.

26. And I will make thy tongue 

27. But when I shall haue spoken vnto thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he that leaueth off, let him leaue: for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. Thou also sonne of man, take thee a bricke, and lay it before thee, and pourtray vpon it the citie, euen Ierusalem,

2. And lay siege against it, and builde a fort against it, and cast a mount against it: set the campe also against it, and lay engins of warre against it rounde about.

3. Moreover take thou to thee an 

4. Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the 

5. For I haue layed vpon thee the yeeres of their iniquitie, according to the nomber of the dayes, euen three hundreth and ninetie dayes: so shalt thou beare the iniquitie of the house of Israel.

6. And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy 

7. Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thy 

8. And, behold, I will lay 

9. Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, 

10. And thy food which thou shalt eat [shall be] by weight, 

11. Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of 

12. And thou shalt eat it [as] barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it 

13. And the Lord said, So shall the children of Israel eate their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will cast them.

14. Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither hath 

15. Then he said to me, Lo, I have given thee cow's 

16. Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break 

17. Because that bread and water shall faile, they shalbe astonied one with another, and shall consume away for their iniquitie.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause [it] 

2. Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the 

3. Thou shalt also take of them a few in number, and bind them in thy 

4. Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; 

5. Thus saith the Lorde God, This is Ierusalem: I haue set it in the middes of the nations and countreyes, that are rounde about her.

6. And she hath changed my 

7. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye 

8. Therefore thus saith the Lorde God, Beholde, I, euen I come against thee, and will execute iudgement in the middes of thee, euen in the sight of the nations.

9. And I will doe in thee, that I neuer did before, neither will do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.

10. For in the middes of thee, the fathers shall eate their sonnes, and the sonnes shall eate their fathers, and I will execute iudgement in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the windes.

11. Wherefore, as I liue, saith the Lorde God, Surely because thou hast defiled my Sanctuarie with all thy filthinesse, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also destroy thee, neither shall mine eye spare thee, neither will I haue any pitie.

12. The third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they bee consumed in the middes of thee: and another third part shall fall by the sword round about thee: and I will scatter the last third part into all windes, and I will drawe out a sword after them.

13. Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be 

14. Moreouer, I will make thee waste, and abhorred among the nations, that are round about thee, and in the sight of all that passe by.

15. So thou shalt bee a reproche and shame, a chastisement and an astonishment vnto the nations, that are rounde about thee, when I shall execute iudgements in thee, in anger and in wrath, and in sharpe rebukes: I the Lorde haue spoken it.

16. When I shall send upon them the evil 

17. So will I send vpon you famine, and euill beastes, and they shall spoyle thee, and pestilence and blood shall passe through thee, and I will bring the sworde vpon thee: I the Lorde haue spoken it.

## Ezekiel 6

1. Againe the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

2. Sonne of man, Set thy face towardes the mountaines of Israel, and prophecie against them,

3. And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the 

4. And your altars shall be desolate, and your 

5. And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their 

6. In all your dwelling places the cities shalbe desolate, and the hie places shalbe laide waste, so that your altars shalbe made waste and desolate, and your idoles shalbe broken, and cease, & your images of the sunne shalbe cut in pieces, & your workes shalbe abolished.

7. And the slaine shall fall in the middes of you, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde.

8. Yet will I leave a remnant, 

9. And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations to which they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their adulterous heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot with their idols: and they 

10. And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, and that I haue not saide in vaine, that I woulde doe this euill vnto them.

11. Thus saith the Lord GOD; 

12. He that is farre off, shal dye of the pestilence, and he that is neere, shal fall by the sword, and hee that remaineth and is besieged, shal dye by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath vpon them.

13. Then shall 

14. So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, even, more desolate 

## Ezekiel 7

1. Moreouer the word of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

2. Also thou sonne of man, thus saith the Lord God, An ende is come vnto the lande of Israel: the ende is come vpon the foure corners of the lande.

3. Now [is] the end [come] upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all 

4. Neither shall mine eye spare thee, neither will I haue pitie: but I will laye thy waies vpon thee: and thine abomination shall bee in the middes of thee, and yee shall knowe that I am the Lorde.

5. Thus saith the Lorde God, Beholde, one euil, euen one euill is come.

6. An end is come, the end is come: it 

7. The 

8. Now I will shortly powre out my wrath vpon thee, and fulfil mine anger vpon thee: I will iudge thee according to thy wayes, and will lay vpon thee all thine abominations.

9. Neither shall mine eie spare thee, neither will I haue pitie, but I will laye vpon thee according to thy wayes, and thine abominations shalbe in the middes of thee, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde that smiteth.

10. Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the 

11. 
          

12. The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer 

13. For the seller shall not 

14. 
          

15. The sword is without, and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field, shall dye with the sword, and he that is in the citie, famine and pestilence shall deuoure him.

16. But they that flee away from them, shall escape, and shalbe in the mountaines, like the doues of the valleis: all they shall mourne, euery one for his iniquitie.

17. All handes shalbe weake, and all knees shall fall away as water.

18. They shall also girde them selues with sackecloth, and feare shall couer them, and shame shalbe vpon all faces, & baldnes vpon their heads.

19. They shall cast their siluer in the streetes, and their golde shalbe cast farre off: their siluer and their gold can not deliuer them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfie their soules, neither fill their bowels: for this ruine is for their iniquitie.

20. As for the beauty of his 

21. And I will give it into the hands of the 

22. My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my 

23. Make a 

24. Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their 

25. When destruction commeth, they shall seeke peace, and shall not haue it.

26. Calamitie shall come vpon calamitie, and rumour shall bee vpon rumour: then shall they seeke a vision of the Prophet: but the Lawe shal perish from the Priest, and counsel from the Ancient.

27. The King shall mourne, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the handes of the people in the land shall be troubled: I wil doe vnto them according to their waies, and according to their iudgements will I iudge them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lorde.

## Ezekiel 8

1. And it came to pass in the 

2. Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of 

3. And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the 

4. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel [was] there, according to the vision that I saw 

5. Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up thy eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the 

6. He said furthermore to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? [even] the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should withdraw from 

7. And he caused me to enter at the gate of the court: and when I looked, beholde, an hole was in the wall.

8. Then said he vnto me, Sonne of man, digge nowe in the wall; when I had digged in the wall, beholde, there was a doore.

9. And he said vnto mee, Go in, and beholde the wicked abominations that they doe here.

10. So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping animals, and 

11. And there stood before them seventy 

12. Then said he to me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel 

13. Againe he saide also vnto me, Turne thee againe, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they doe.

14. Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which [was] toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for 

15. Then saide hee vnto me, Hast thou seene this, O sonne of man? Turne thee againe, and thou shalt see greater abominations then these.

16. And he caused me to enter into the inner court of the Lordes house, and beholde, at the doore of the Temple of the Lord, betweene the porche and the altar were about fiue and twentie men with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces towarde the East, and they worshipped the sunne, towarde the East.

17. Then he said to me, Hast thou seen [this], O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the 

18. Therefore will I also execute my wrath: mine eye shall not spare them, neither will I haue pitie, and though they crie in mine eares with a loude voyce, yet will I not heare them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over 

2. And, behold, six 

3. And the glory of the God of Israel had 

4. And the LORD said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that 

5. And to the other he said, that I might heare, Goe ye after him through the citie, and smite: let your eye spare none, neither haue pitie.

6. Slay utterly old [and] young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom [is] the 

7. And he sayde vnto them, Defile the house, and fill the courtes with the slaine, then goe foorth: and they went out, and slewe them in the citie.

8. And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, 

9. Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [is] exceeding great, and the land is full of 

10. As touching me also, mine eye shall not spare them, neither will I haue pitie, but will recompence their wayes vpon their heades.

11. And beholde, the man clothed with linen which had the ynkhorne by his side, made report, and saide, Lorde, I haue done as thou hast commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the 

2. And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, [even] under the cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter [them] over 

3. Now the Cherubims stood vpon the right side of the house, when the man went in, and the cloude filled the inner court.

4. Then the glory of the LORD 

5. And the 

6. And when he had commaunded the man clothed with linnen, saying, Take fire from betweene the wheeles, & from betweene ye Cherubims, then he went in and stood beside ye wheele.

7. And one Cherub stretched forth his hand from betweene the Cherubims vnto the fire, that was betweene the Cherubims, and tooke thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linnen: who tooke it and went out.

8. And there appeared in the Cherubims, the likenesse of a mans hande vnder their wings.

9. And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels [was] as the colour of a 

10. And their appearance (for they were all foure of one facion) was as if one wheele had bene in another wheele.

11. When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they 

12. And their whole bodie, and their rings, and their hands, and their wings, & the wheeles were full of eyes round about, euen in the same foure wheeles.

13. And the Cherub cryed to these wheeles in mine hearing, saying, O wheele.

14. And euery beast had foure faces: the first face was the face of a Cherub, & the second face was the face of a man, and the thirde the face of a lyon, and the fourth the face of an Egle.

15. And the Cherubims were lifted vp: this is the beast that I sawe at the riuer Chebar.

16. And when ye Cherubims went, the wheeles went by them: and when the Cherubims lift vp their wings to mount vp from the earth, the same wheeles also turned not from beside them.

17. When they stood, [these] stood; and when they were lifted up, [these] lifted up themselves [also]: for the 

18. 
          

19. And the Cherubims lift vp their wings, and mounted vp from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheeles also were besides them: and euery one stoode at the entrie of the gate of the Lordes House at the East side, and the glorie of the God of Israel was vpo them on hie.

20. This [is] the 

21. Euery one had foure faces, and euery one foure wings, and the likenesse of mans hands was vnder their wings.

22. And the likenes of their faces was the selfe same faces, which I sawe by the riuer Chebar, and the appearance of the Cherubims was ye selfe same, and they went euery one straight forwarde.

## Ezekiel 11

1. Moreouer, the Spirite lift me vp, and brought me vnto the East gate of the Lordes house, which lyeth Eastwarde, and beholde, at the entrie of the gate were fiue and twentie men: among whome I sawe Iaazaniah the sonne of Azur, and Pelatiah the sonne of Benaiah, the princes of the people.

2. Then said he vnto me, Sonne of man, these are the men that imagine mischiefe, and deuise wicked counsell in this citie.

3. Who say, 

4. Therefore prophesie against them, sonne of man, prophesie.

5. And the Spirite of the Lord fell vpon me, and said vnto me, Speake, Thus saith the Lorde, O ye house of Israel, this haue ye said, and I know that which riseth vp of your mindes.

6. Many haue ye murthered in this citie, and ye haue filled the streets thereof with the slaine.

7. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] 

8. Ye haue feared the sworde, and I wil bring a sworde vpon you, saith the Lorde God.

9. And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and deliver you into 

10. Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of 

11. This citie shall not be your caldron, neyther shall ye be the flesh in the middes thereof, but I will iudge you in the border of Israel.

12. And ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde: for ye haue not walked in my statutes, neither executed my iudgements, but haue done after the maners of the heathen, that are round about you.

13. And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of 

14. Againe the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

15. Son of man, thy 

16. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little 

17. Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God, I will gather you againe from the people, and assemble you out of the countreis where ye haue bene scattered, & I will giue you ye land of Israel.

18. And they shall come thither, and they shal take away all the idoles thereof, and all the abominations thereof from thence.

19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the 

20. That they may walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements, and execute them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

21. But vpon them, whose heart is towarde their idoles, and whose affection goeth after their abominations, I will lay their way vpon their owne heades, saith the Lorde God.

22. Then did the Cherubims lift vp their wings, and the wheeles besides them, and the glorie of the God of Israel was vpon them on hie.

23. And the glorie of the Lord went vp from the middes of the citie, & stoode vpon the moutaine which is towarde the East side of the citie.

24. Afterwarde the Spirite tooke me vp, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Caldea to them that were led away captiues: so the vision that I had seene, went vp from me.

25. Then I spoke to them of the 

## Ezekiel 12

1. The worde of the Lorde also came vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and see 

3. Therefore thou sonne of man, prepare thy stuffe to goe into captiuitie, and goe foorth by day in their sight: and thou shalt passe from thy place to another place in their sight, if it be possible that they may consider it: for they are a rebellious house.

4. Then shalt thou bring foorth thy stuffe by day in their sight as the stuffe of him that goeth into captiuitie: and thou shalt go forth at euen in their sight, as they that go foorth into captiuitie.

5. Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and cary out thereby.

6. In their sight shalt thou bear [it] upon [thy] shoulders, [and] carry [it] forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou mayest not see the ground: for I have set thee [for] a 

7. And as I was commaunded, so I brought forth my stuffe by day, as ye stuffe of one that goeth into captiuitie: and by night I digged through the wall with mine hand, & brought it forth in ye darke, & I bare it vpo my shoulder in their sight.

8. And in the morning came the word of the Lord vnto me, saying,

9. Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What 

10. But say thou vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God, This burden concerneth the chiefe in Ierusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.

11. Say, I am your signe: like as I haue done, so shall it be done vnto them: they shall goe into bondage and captiuitie.

12. And the chiefest that is among them, shall beare vpon his shoulder in the darke, and shall goe forth: they shall digge through the wall, to cary out thereby: he shall couer his face, that he see not the ground with his eies.

13. My net also will I spread upon 

14. And I will scatter toward euerie winde all that are about him to helpe him, and all his garisons, and I will drawe out the sworde after them.

15. And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I shall scatter them among the nations, & disperse them in the countreis.

16. But I will leave a 

17. Moreouer, the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

18. Sonne of man, eate thy bread with trembling and drinke thy water with trouble, & with carefulnesse,

19. And say vnto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lorde God of the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and of the lande of Israel, They shall eate their bread with carefulnes, and drinke their water with desolation: for the lande shall bee desolate from her abundance because of the crueltie of them that dwell therein.

20. And the cities that are inhabited, shal be left voyde, and the land shall be desolate, and yee shall knowe that I am the Lorde.

21. And the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

22. Son of man, what [is] that proverb [that] ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days 

23. Tell them therefore, Thus sayeth the Lord God, I wil make this prouerbe to cease, and they shall no more vse it as a prouerbe in Israel: but say vnto them, The daies are at hand and the effect of euery vision.

24. For no vision shall be any more in vaine, neither shall there bee any flattering diuination within the house of Israel.

25. For I am the Lorde: I wil speake, and that thing that I shall speake, shall come to passe: it shall be no more prolonged: for in your dayes, O rebellious house, will I saye the thing, and will performe it, sayeth the Lord God.

26. Againe the word of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

27. Son of man, behold, [they of] the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth [is] for 

28. Therefore say vnto them, Thus sayth the Lorde God, All my wordes shall no longer be delayed, but that thing which I haue spoken, shall be done, saith the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And ye word of ye Lord came vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou to them that prophesy out of their 

3. Thus sayth the Lorde God, Woe vnto the foolish Prophets that followe their owne spirit, and haue seene nothing.

4. O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes 

5. 
          

6. They haue seene vanitie, and lying diuination, saying, The Lord sayth it, and the Lorde hath not sent them: & they haue made others to hope that they would cofirme the word of their prophecie.

7. Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, though 

8. Therefore thus sayth the Lorde God, Because ye haue spoken vanytie & haue seene lyes, therefore beholde, I am agaynst you, sayth the Lorde God,

9. And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the 

10. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, 

11. Say vnto them which daube it with vntempered morter, that it shall fall: for there shall come a great showre, and I wil sende haylestones, which shall cause it to fall, and a stormie winde shall breake it.

12. Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not bee sayd vnto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye haue daubed it?

13. Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, I will cause a stormie winde to breake foorth in my wrath, & a great showre shall bee in mine anger, & hailestones in mine indignation to consume it.

14. So I wil destroy the wall that ye haue daubed with vntempered morter, and bring it downe to the ground, so that the fundation thereof shalbe discouered, and it shall fal, and ye shalbe consumed in the middes thereof, and ye shall know, that I am the Lord.

15. Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with 

16. To wit, the Prophets of Israel, which prophesie vpon Ierusalem, and see visions of peace for it, and there is no peace, sayth the Lord God.

17. Likewise thou sonne of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesie out of their owne heart: and prophesie thou against them, and say,

18. And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the [women] that sew 

19. And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of 

20. Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against your [magic] charms, with which ye there hunt the 

21. Your vailes also will I teare, and deliuer my people out of your hande, and they shalbe no more in your hands to be hunted, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde.

22. Because with lies ye have made the heart of the 

23. Therefore ye shal see no more vanitie, nor diuine diuinatios: for I wil deliuer my people out of your hand, & ye shall know that I am ye Lord.

## Ezekiel 14

1. Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and 

2. And the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

3. Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their 

4. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the 

5. That 

6. Therfore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus sayth the Lord God, Returne, and withdraw your selues, and turne your faces from your idoles, and turne your faces from all your abominations.

7. For euery one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that soiourneth in Israel, which departeth from mee, and setteth vp his idoles in his heart, and putteth the stumbling blocke of his iniquitie before his face, and commeth to a Prophet, for to inquire of him for me, I the Lord will answere him for my selfe,

8. And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example and prouerbe, and I will cut him off from the middes of my people, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde.

9. And if the prophet be 

10. And they shall beare their punishment: the punishment of the Prophet shall bee euen as the punishment of him that asketh,

11. That the house of 

12. The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,

13. Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, 

14. Though these three men, 

15. If I bring noysome beastes into the lande and they spoyle it, so that it bee desolate, that no man may passe through, because of beastes,

16. Though these three men were in the mids thereof, As I liue, sayth the Lord God, they shall saue neither sonnes nor daughters: they onely shalbe deliuered, but the land shall be waste.

17. Or if I bring a sworde vpon this land, and say, Sword, go through the land, so that I destroy man and beast out of it,

18. Though these three men were in the mids thereof, As I liue, sayth the Lorde God, they shal deliuer neither sonnes nor daughters, but they onely shall be deliuered themselues.

19. Or if I send a pestilence into this land, and powre out my wrath vpon it in blood, to destroy out of it man and beast,

20. And though Noah, Daniel and Iob were in the middes of it, As I liue, sayth the Lorde God, they shal deliuer neither sonne nor daughter: they shall but deliuer their owne soules by their righteousnes.

21. For thus saith the Lord God, Howe much more when I sende my foure sore iudgements vpon Ierusalem, euen the sworde, and famine, and the noysome beast & pestilence, to destroy man and beast out of it?

22. Yet, behold, in it shall be left a 

23. And they shal comfort you, when yee see their way and their enterprises: & ye shal know, that I haue not done without cause all that I haue done in it, saith the Lorde God.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And ye word of ye Lord came vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, [or than] a branch which is among the 

3. Shall wood bee taken thereof to doe any worke? or wil men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

4. Behold, it is cast in the fire to be consumed: the fire consumeth both the endes of it, and the middes of it is burnt. Is it meete for any worke?

5. Behold, when it was whole, it was meete for no worke: how much lesse shall it bee meete for any worke, when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burnt?

6. Therefore thus sayth the Lorde God, As the vine tree, that is among the trees of the forest, which I haue giuen to the fire to be consumed, so will I giue the inhabitants of Ierusalem.

7. And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from [one] 

8. And when I make the lande waste, because they haue greatly offended, saith the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 16

1. Againe, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

2. Sonne of man, cause Ierusalem to knowe her abominations,

3. And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD to Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity [is] of the land 

4. And [as for] thy nativity, in the day thou wast 

5. None eye pitied thee to do any of these vnto thee, for to haue compassion vpon thee, but thou wast cast out in the open fielde to the contempt of thy person in ye day that thou wast borne.

6. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy 

7. I haue caused thee to multiplie as the bud of the fielde, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou hast gotten excellent ornaments: thy breastes are facioned, thine heare is growen, where as thou wast naked and bare.

8. Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered 

9. Then I washed thee with 

10. I clothed thee also with broydred worke, and shod thee with badgers skin: and I girded thee about with fine linen, & I couered thee with silke.

11. I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets vpon thine handes, and a chaine on thy necke.

12. And I put a jewel in thy nose, and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful 

13. Thus wast thou deckt with gold and siluer, and thy rayment was of fine linen, and silke, and broydred worke: thou didest eate fine floure, and honie and oyle, and thou wast very beautifull, and thou didest grow vp into a kingdome.

14. And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for it [was] perfect through my 

15. But thou didst 

16. And of thy garments thou didst take, and didst deck thy high places with various colours, 

17. Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and hast 

18. And tookest thy broydred garments, and coueredst them: and thou hast set mine oyle and my perfume before them.

19. My meate also, which I gaue thee, as fine floure, oyle, and honie, wherewith I fedde thee, thou hast euen set it before them for a sweete sauour: thus it was, saith the Lord God.

20. Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me, and these hast thou sacrificed to them to 

21. That thou hast slaine my children, and deliuered them to cause them to passe through fire for them?

22. And in all thine abominations and whoredomes thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.

23. And beside all thy wickednes (wo, wo vnto thee, saith the Lord God)

24. Thou hast also built vnto thee an hie place, and hast made thee an hie place in euery streete.

25. Thou hast built thine hie place at euery corner of the way, and hast made thy beautie to be abhorred: thou hast opened thy feete to euery one that passed by, & multiplied thy whoredome.

26. Thou hast also committed harlotry with the 

27. Beholde, therefore I did stretche out mine hand ouer thee, and will diminish thine ordinarie, and deliuer thee vnto the will of them that hate thee, euen to the daughters of the Philistims, which are ashamed of thy wicked way.

28. Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insaciable: yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

29. Thou hast moreouer multiplied thy fornication from the land of Canaan vnto Caldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.

30. Howe weake is thine heart, saith the Lorde God, seeing thou doest all these thinges, euen the worke of a presumptuous whorish woman?

31. In that thou buildest thy eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, 

32. But as a wife that playeth the harlot, and taketh others for her husband:

33. They giue giftes to all other whores, but thou giuest giftes vnto all thy louers, and rewardest them, that they may come vnto thee on euery side for thy fornication.

34. And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy fornications, neither the like fornication shall be after thee: for in that thou giuest a rewarde, and no reward is giuen vnto thee, therefore thou art contrary.

35. Wherefore, O harlot, heare the worde of the Lord.

36. Thus sayeth the Lorde God, Because thy shame was powred out, and thy filthinesse discouered through thy fornications with thy louers, and with all the idoles of thine abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didest offer vnto them,

37. Behold, therefore I will gather all 

38. And I will judge thee, as women that 

39. I will also giue thee into their handes, and they shal destroy thine hie place, and shall breake downe thine hie places. They shall strippe thee also out of thy clothes, and shall take thy faire iewels, and leaue thee naked and bare.

40. They shall also bring vp a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swordes.

41. And they shall burne vp thine houses with fire, and execute iudgements vpon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt giue no reward any more.

42. So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my 

43. Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these [things]; behold, therefore I also will 

44. Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use [this] proverb against thee, saying, As [is] the mother, 

45. Thou [art] thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou [art] the sister of thy 

46. And thy elder sister [is] Samaria, she and her 

47. Yet hast thou 

48. As I liue, saith the Lorde God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, neither shee nor her daughters, as thou hast done and thy daughters.

49. Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, 

50. But they were hautie, and committed abomination before mee: therefore I tooke them away, as pleased me.

51. Neither 

52. Therefore thou which hast iustified thy sisters, beare thine owne shame for thy sinnes, that thou hast committed more abominable then they which are more righteous then thou art: be thou therefore confounded also, and beare thy shame, seeing that thou hast iustified thy sisters.

53. When I shall bring again 

54. That thou mayest bear thy own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a 

55. When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, 

56. For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned 

57. Before thy wickedness was 

58. Thou hast borne therefore thy wickednesse and thine abomination, saith the Lord.

59. For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the 

60. Nevertheless I will 

61. Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive 

62. And I wil establish my couenant with thee, and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord,

10. Yea, behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, 

11. Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

12. Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these [things mean]? tell [them], Behold, the king of Babylon hath come to Jerusalem, and hath taken 

13. And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken 

14. That the kingdome might be in subiection, and not lift it selfe vp, but keepe their couenant, and stand to it.

15. But he rebelled against him, and sent his ambassadours into Egypt, that they might giue him horses, and much people: shall hee prosper? shall he escape, that doeth such things? or shal he breake the couenant, and be deliuered?

16. As I liue, saith the Lord God, he shall die in the middes of Babel, in the place of the King, that had made him King, whose othe he despised, and whose couenant made with him, he brake.

17. Neither shall Pharaoh with his mightie hoste, and great multitude of people, mainteine him in the warre, when they haue cast vp mounts, and builded ramparts to destroy many persons.

18. Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given 

19. Therefore, thus sayth the Lord God, As I liue, I wil surely bring mine othe that he hath despised, and my couenant that he hath broken vpon his owne head.

20. And I wil spread my net vpon him, & he shalbe taken in my net, & I wil bring him to Babel, and will enter into iudgement with him there for his trespas that he hath committed against me.

21. And all that flee from him with all his hoste, shal fall by the sword, & they that remaine, shalbe scattered towarde all the windes: and ye shall know that I the Lord haue spoken it.

22. Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch

1. The worde of the Lord came vnto me againe, saying,

2. What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, 

3. As I liue, sayth the Lord God, ye shall vse this prouerbe no more in Israel.

4. Beholde, all soules are mine, both the soule of the father, and also the soule of the sonne are mine: the soule that sinneth, it shall die.

5. But if a man be iust, and doe that which is lawfull, and right,

6. [And] hath not eaten 

7. Neither hath oppressed any, but hath restored the pledge to his dettour: he that hath spoyled none by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,

8. And hath not giuen foorth vpon vsurie, neither hath taken any increase, but hath withdrawen his hand from iniquitie, and hath executed true iudgement betweene man and man,

9. And hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my iudgements to deale truely, he is iust, he shall surely liue, sayth the Lord God.

10. If he beget a sonne, that is a thiefe, or a sheader of blood, if he do any one of these things,

11. Though he doe not all these things, but either hath eaten vpon the mountaines, or defiled his neighbours wife,

12. Or hath oppressed the poore and needy, or hath spoyled by violence, or hath not restored the pledge, or hath lift vp his eyes vnto the idoles, or hath committed abomination,

13. Hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; 

14. But if he beget a sonne, that seeth all his fathers sinnes, which he hath done, and feareth, neither doeth such like,

15. That hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idols of ye house of Israel, nor hath defiled his neighbours wife,

16. Neither hath oppressed any, nor hath withholden the pledge, neither hath spoyled by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,

17. Neither hath withdrawen his hand from the afflicted, nor receiued vsurie nor increase, but hath executed my iudgements, and hath walked in my statutes, he shall not die in the iniquitie of his father, but he shal surely liue.

18. His father, because he cruelly oppressed and spoyled his brother by violence, and hath not done good among his people, loe, euen he dyeth in his iniquitie.

19. Yet say ye, Wherefore shall not the sonne beare the iniquitie of the father? because ye sonne hath executed iudgement & iustice, and hath kept all my statutes, and done them, he shal surely liue,

20. The same soule that sinneth, shal die: the sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the father, neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne, but the righteousnes of the righteous shall be vpon him, and the wickednesse of the wicked shall be vpon him selfe.

21. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my

26. For when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnes, and committeth iniquitie, he shall euen die for the same, he shal euen die for his iniquitie, that he hath done.

27. Againe when the wicked turneth away from his wickednes that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawfull and right, he shal saue his soule aliue.

28. Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that hee hath committed, he shall surely liue and shall not die.

29. Yet saith ye house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equall. O house of Israel, are not my wayes equall? or are not your wayes vnequall?

30. Therefore I will iudge you, O house of Israel, euery one according to his wayes, sayth the Lord God: returne therefore and cause others to turne away from all your transgressions: so iniquitie shall not be your destruction.

12. Moreouer I gaue them also my Sabbaths to be a signe betwene me & them, that they might knowe that I am the Lord, that sanctifie them.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernes: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them, and my Sabbaths haue they greatly polluted: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them in the wildernes to consume them,

14. But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the 

15. Yet neuerthelesse, I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes that I would not bring them into the lande, which I had giuen them, flowing with milke and hony, which was pleasant aboue all landes,

16. Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but profaned my

18. But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your

20. And sanctifie my Sabbaths, and they shall bee a signe betweene mee and you, that ye may knowe that I am the Lord your God.

21. Notwithstanding the children rebelled against mee: they walked not in my statutes, nor kept my iudgements to doe them, which if a man doe, hee shall liue in them, but they polluted my Sabbaths: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpo them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the wildernes.

22. Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand & had respect to my Name that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them foorth.

23. Yet I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes, that I would scatter them among the heathen, & disperse them through the countreys,

47. And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every 

48. And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord haue kindled it, and it shall not bee quenched.

49. Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak 

## Ezekiel 21

1. The word of ye Lord came to me againe, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, 

3. And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I [am] against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the 

4. Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth from its sheath against all flesh from the south to the 

5. That all flesh may knowe that I the Lorde haue drawen my sworde out of his sheath, and it shall not returne any more.

6. Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with breaking 

7. And it shall be, when they say to thee, Why sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, 

8. Againe, the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

9. Sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lorde God, say, A sworde, a sworde both sharpe, and fourbished.

10. It is sharpened to make a grievous slaughter; it is polished that it may 

11. And he hath given it to be polished, that it may be handled: the sword is sharpened, and it is polished, to give it into the hand of the 

12. Cry and wail, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it [shall be] upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: 

13. Because [it is] a trial, 

14. Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite 

15. I haue brought the feare of the sword into all their gates to make their heart to faint, and to multiplie their ruines. Ah it is made bright, and it is dressed for the slaughter.

16. Go thee 

17. I wil also smite mine hands together, & wil cause my wrath to cease. I the Lord haue said it.

18. The worde of the Lorde came vnto mee againe, saying,

19. Also, thou son of man, mark 

20. Mark a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and 

21. For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made [his] arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in 

22. At his right hand was the diuination for Ierusalem to appoint captaines, to open their mouth in the slaughter, and to lift vp their voyce with shouting, to laye engines of warre against the gates, to cast a mount, and to builde a fortresse.

23. And it shall be to them 

24. Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde God, Because ye haue made your iniquitie to bee remembred, in discouering your rebellion, that in al your workes your sinnes might appeare: because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.

25. And thou, profane wicked 

26. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the 

27. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no [more], until he 

28. And thou, sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lorde God to the children of Ammon, and to their blasphemie: say thou, I say, The sword, the sword is drawen foorth, and fourbished to the slaughter, to consume, because of the glittering:

29. While they see 

30. Shall I cause it to returne into his sheath? I will iudge thee in the place where thou wast created, euen in the land of thine habitation.

31. And I wil powre out mine indignation vpon thee, and will blowe against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliuer thee into the hand of beastly men, and skilfull to destroy.

32. Thou shalt bee in the fire to be deuoured: thy blood shall be in the middes of the lande, and thou shalt be no more remembred: for I the Lord haue spoken it.

## Ezekiel 22

1. Moreouer, the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

2. Now, thou son of man, wilt thou 

3. Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her 

4. Thou hast offended in thy blood, that thou hast shed, & hast polluted thy selfe in thine idols, which thou hast made, and thou hast caused thy dayes to draw neere, & art come vnto thy terme: therefore haue I made thee a reproch to the heathen, and a mocking to all countreys.

5. [Those that are] near, and [those that are] far from thee, shall mock thee, [who art] 

6. Beholde, the princes of Israel euery one in thee was ready to his power, to shed blood.

7. In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee 

8. Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast polluted my Sabbaths.

9. In thee are men that cary tales to shed blood: in thee are they that eate vpon the mountaines: in ye mids of thee they comit abomination.

10. In thee haue they discouered their fathers shame: in thee haue they vexed her that was polluted in her floures.

11. And euery one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife, and euery one hath wickedly defiled his daughter in lawe, and in thee hath euery man forced his owne sister, euen his fathers daughter.

12. In thee haue they taken giftes to shed blood: thou hast taken vsurie and the encrease, and thou hast defrauded thy neighbours by extortion, & hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God.

13. Behold, therefore I have 

14. Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands 

15. And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy 

16. And thou shalt take thy 

17. And the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

18. Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become 

19. Therefore, thus sayth the Lorde God, Because ye are all as drosse, beholde, therefore I will gather you in the middes of Ierusalem.

20. [As] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt [it]; so will I gather [you] in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave [you there], 

21. I wil gather you, I say, and blowe the fire of my wrath vpon you, and you shalbe melted in the mids thereof.

22. As siluer is melted in the mids of the fornace, so shal ye be melted in the mids thereof, and ye shall knowe, that I the Lord haue powred out my wrath vpon you.

23. And the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

24. Son of man, say to her, Thou [art] the land that is not cleansed, 

25. [There is] a conspiracy 

26. Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shown [difference] between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their 

27. Her princes in the mids thereof are like wolues, rauening the praye to shed blood, and to destroy soules for their owne couetous lucre.

28. And her 

29. The people of the land haue violently oppressed by spoyling and robbing, and haue vexed the poore and the needy: yea, they haue oppressed the stranger against right.

30. And I sought for a man among them, that should 

31. Therefore haue I powred out mine indignation vpon them, and consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their owne wayes haue I rendred vpon their heads, sayth the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one 

3. And they committed harlotries in 

4. And the names of 

5. And Aholah played the harlot when 

6. Which were clothed with blewe silke, both captaines and princes: they were all pleasant yong men, and horsemen riding vpon horses.

7. Thus she committed her whoredome with them, euen with all them that were the chosen men of Asshur, and with all on whome she doted, and defiled her selfe with all their idoles.

8. Neither left she her harlotries [brought] from Egypt: for in her youth they 

9. Wherefore I deliuered her into the hands of her louers, euen into the hands of the Assyrians, vpon whome she doted.

10. These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for 

11. And when her sister Aholibah sawe this, she marred her selfe with inordinate loue, more then she, and with her fornications more then her sister with her fornications.

12. She doted vpon the Assyrians her neighbours, both captaines and princes clothed with diuers sutes, horsemen ryding vpon horses: they were all pleasant yong men.

13. Then I sawe that she was defiled, and that they were both after one sort,

14. And [that] she increased her harlotries: for when she saw men 

15. And girded with girdles vpon their loynes, and with dyed attyre vpon their heads (looking all like princes after the maner of the Babylonians in Caldea, the land of their natiuitie)

16. Assoone, I say, as she sawe them, she doted vpon them, and sent messengers vnto them into Caldea.

17. Nowe when the Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue, they defiled her with their fornication, and she was polluted with them, and her lust departed from them.

18. So she discouered her fornication, and disclosed her shame: then mine heart forsooke her, like as mine heart had forsaken her sister.

19. Yet she encreased her whoredome more, and called to remembrance ye dayes of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

20. For she doted vpon their seruants whose members are as the members of asses, and whose yssue is like the yssue of horses.

21. Thou calledst to remembrance the wickednes of thy youth, when thy teates were bruised by ye Egyptians: therefore ye paps of thy youth are thus.

22. Therefore, O Aholibah, thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will raise vp thy louers against thee, from whome thine heart is departed, and I will bring them against thee on euery side,

23. The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, 

24. Euen these shal come against thee with charets, waggons, and wheeles, and with a multitude of people, which shall set against thee, buckler and shield, and helmet round about: and I will leaue the punishment vnto them, and they shall iudge thee according to their iudgements.

25. And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy 

26. They shal also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fayre iewels.

27. Thus wil I make thy wickednes to cease from thee and thy fornication out of the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

28. For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I wil deliuer thee into the hand of them, whome thou hatest: euen into the hands of them from whome thine heart is departed.

29. And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy 

30. I wil doe these things vnto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idoles.

31. Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her 

32. Thus saith ye Lord God, Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cup, deepe and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorne and had in derision, because it containeth much.

33. Thou shalt be filled with 

34. Thou shalt euen drinke it, and wring it out to the dregges, and thou shalt breake the sheards thereof, and teare thine owne breasts: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God.

35. Therefore thus saith the Lorde God, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behinde thy backe, therefore thou shalt also beare thy wickednes and thy whoredome.

36. The Lord sayd moreouer vnto me, Sonne of man, wilt thou iudge Aholah & Aholibah? and wilt thou declare to them their abominations?

37. That they have committed adultery, and blood [is] in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through [the fire], to 

38. Moreouer, thus haue they done vnto me: they haue defiled my Sanctuarie in the same day, and haue prophaned my Sabbaths.

39. For when they had slaine their children to their idoles, they came the same day into my Sanctuarie to defile it: and loe, thus haue they done in the middes of mine house.

40. And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from 

41. And satest 

42. And a voice of a multitude being at ease [was] with her: and with the men of the common sort [were] brought 

43. Then I sayd vnto her, that was olde in adulteries, Now shall she and her fornications come to an end.

44. And they went in vnto her as they goe to a common harlot: so went they to Aholah and Aholibah the wicked women.

45. And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of 

46. Wherefore thus sayth the Lord God, I will bring a multitude vpon them, and will giue them vnto the tumult, and to the spoyle,

47. And the multitude shall stone them with stones, and cut them with their swordes: they shal slay their sonnes, and their daughters, and burne vp their houses with fire.

48. Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all 

49. And they shall laye your wickednesse vpon you, and ye shall beare the sinnes of your idoles, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Again in the 

2. Sonne of man, write thee the name of the day, euen of this same day: for the King of Babel set himselfe against Ierusalem this same day.

3. And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a 

4. Gather its 

5. Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the 

6. Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot 

7. For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a 

8. That it might cause wrath to arise, & take vengeance: euen I haue set her blood vpon an high rocke that it should not be couered.

9. Therefore thus saith ye Lord God, Woe to the bloody citie, for I will make ye burning great.

10. Heap on wood, 

11. Then set it emptie vpon the coles thereof, that the brasse of it may be hot, and may burne, and that the filthinesse of it may be molten in it, and that the skomme of it may be consumed.

12. 
          

13. In thy filthiness [is] lewdness: because I 

14. I the LORD have spoken [it]: it shall come to pass, and I will do [it]; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall 

15. Also the worde of ye Lord came vnto me, saying,

16. Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the 

17. Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind thy turban upon thee, 

18. So I spoke to the people in the morning: and at evening my wife died; and I did 

19. And the people said vnto me, Wilt thou not tell vs what these things meane towarde vs that thou doest so?

20. Then I answered them, The worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

21. Speak to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will 

22. And ye shall doe as I haue done: ye shall not couer your lippes, neither shall ye eate the bread of men.

23. And your tyre shalbe vpon your heads, and your shooes vpon your feete: ye shall not mourne nor weepe, but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourne one toward another.

24. Thus Ezekiel is vnto you a signe: according to all that he hath done, ye shall do: and when this commeth, ye shall know that I am the Lord God.

25. Also, thou sonne of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their power, ye ioy of their honor, ye pleasure of their eyes, & the desire of their heart, their sonnes & their daughters?

26. That he that escapeth in that day, shal come vnto thee to tell thee that which hee hath heard with his eares?

27. In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speake, and be no more dumme, & thou shalt be a signe vnto them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 25

1. The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,

2. Sonne of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophecie against them,

3. And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, 

4. Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the 

5. And I will make 

6. For thus saith the Lord God, Because thou hast clapped the hands, and stamped with the feete, and reioyced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel,

7. Beholde, therefore I will stretche out mine hand vpon thee, and will deliuer thee to be spoyled of the heathen, and I will roote thee out from the people, and I will cause thee to be destroyed out of the countreys, and I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.

8. Thus saith the Lord God, Because that Moab and Seir doe say, Beholde, the house of Iudah is like vnto all the heathen,

9. Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, 

10. I will call the men of the East against the Ammonites, and will giue them in possession, so that the Ammonites shal no more be remembred among the nations,

11. And I will execute iudgements vpon Moab, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord.

12. Thus sayth the Lorde God, Because that Edom hath done euill by taking vengeance vpon the house of Iudah, and hath committed great offence, and reuenged himselfe vpon them,

13. Therefore thus saith the Lorde God, I will also stretch out mine hand vpon Edom, and destroy man and beast out of it, and I will make it desolate from Teman, and they of Dedan shall fall by the sworde.

14. And I will execute my vengeance vpon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall doe in Edom according to mine anger, and according to mine indignation, & they shall know my vengeance, sayth the Lord God.

15. Thus sayth the Lord God, Because the Philistims haue executed vengeance, and reuenged themselues with a despitefull heart, to destroy it for the olde hatred,

16. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the 

17. And I will execute great vengeance vpon them with rebukes of mine indignation, and they shall knowe that I am the Lorde, when I shall lay my vengeance vpon them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it came to pass in the 

2. Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken [that was] the 

3. Therefore thus sayth the Lorde God, Beholde, I come against thee, O Tyrus, and I will bring vp many nations against thee, as the sea mounteth vp with his waues.

4. And they shall destroy the walles of Tyrus and breake downe her towres: I will also scrape her dust from her, & make her like the top of a rocke.

5. Thou shalt be for the spreading of nettes in the middes of the sea: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God, and it shalbe a spoile to ye nations.

6. And her 

7. For thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I will bring vpon Tyrus Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, a King of Kings from the North, with horses and with charets, and with horsemen, with a multitude and much people.

8. He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the fielde, and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift vp the buckler against thee.

9. He shall set engins of warre before him against thy walles, and with his weapons breake downe thy towres.

10. The dust of his horses shall couer thee, for their multitude: thy walles shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheeles, and of the charets, when he shall enter into thy gates as into the entrie of a citie that is broken downe.

11. With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong 

12. And they shall robbe thy riches, and spoyle thy marchandise, and they shall breake downe thy walles, and destroy thy pleasant houses, and they shall cast thy stones and thy timber and thy dust into the middes of the water.

13. Thus will I cause the sounde of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thine harpes shall be no more heard.

14. And I will make thee like the top of a rock: 

15. Thus sayth the Lorde God to Tyrus, Shall not the yles tremble at the sounde of thy fall? and at the crie of the wounded, when they shall be slaine and murthered in the middes of thee?

16. Then all the princes of the 

17. And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, [that wast] inhabited 

18. Nowe shall the yles be astonished in the day of thy fall: yea, the yles that are in the sea, shall be troubled at thy departure.

19. For thus saith the Lord God, When I shall make thee a desolate citie, like ye cities that are not inhabited, and when I shall bring the deepe vpon thee, and great waters shall couer thee,

20. When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people 

21. I will bring thee to nothing, & thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou neuer be found againe, sayth the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,

2. Sonne of ma, take vp a lametation for Tyrus,

3. And say to Tyre, O thou that dwelleth at the entrance of the sea, [which art] a merchant 

4. Thy borders are in the middes of the sea, and thy builders haue made thee of perfit beauty.

5. They have made all thy [ship] planks of fir trees of 

6. [Of] the oaks of Bashan have they made thy oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches [of] ivory, [brought] out of the isles of

8. The inhabitants of Zidon, and Aruad were thy mariners, O Tyrus: thy wise men that were in thee, they were thy pilots.

9. The ancients of Gebal and its wise [men] were in thee thy 

10. They of Persia, and of Lud & of Phut were in thine armie: thy men of warre they hanged the shielde and helmet in thee: they set foorth thy beautie.

11. The men of Arvad with thy army [were] upon thy walls on all sides, and the 

12. They of Tarshish were thy marchantes for the multitude of all riches, for siluer, yron, tynne, and leade, which they brought to thy faires.

13. 
          

14. They of the house of 

15. The men of Dedan [were] thy merchants; many isles [were] the merchandise of thy hand: they brought thee [for] a present 

16. They of Aram were thy marchants for the multitude of thy wares: they occupied in thy faires with emerauds, purple, & broidred worke, and fine linen, and corall, and pearle.

17. Judah, and the land of Israel, they [were] thy merchants: they traded in thy market in wheat of 

18. They of Damascus were thy marchants in ye multitude of thy wares, for the multitude of all riches, as in the wine of Helbon and white wooll.

19. They of Dan also and of Iauan, going to and fro, occupied in thy faires: yron woorke, cassia and calamus were among thy marchandise.

20. They of Dedan were thy marchants in precious clothes for the charets.

21. They of Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar occupied with thee, in lambes, and rammes and goates: in these were they thy marchants.

22. The marchats of Sheba, and Raamah were thy marchantes: they occupied in thy faires with the chiefe of all spices, and with al precious stones and golde.

23. They of Haram and Canneh and Eden, the marchants of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad were thy marchants.

24. These were thy marchants in all sortes of things, in raiment of blewe silke, and of broydred woorke, and in coffers for the rich apparell, which were bound with cordes: chaines also were among thy marchandise.

25. The shippes of Tarshish were thy chiefe in thy marchandise, and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the middes of the sea.

26. Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the 

27. Thy riches and thy faires, thy marchandise, thy mariners and pilotes, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy marchandise & al thy men of warre that are in thee, and all thy multitude which is in the middes of thee, shall fall in the middes of the sea in the day of thy ruine.

31. They shal plucke off their heare for thee & gird them with a sackecloth, and they shal weepe for thee with sorow of heart & bitter mourning.

32. And in their mourning, they shal take vp a lametation for thee, saying, What citie is like Tyrus, so destroied in the middes of the sea!

33. When thy wares went foorth of the seas, thou filledst many people, & thou diddest enrich the Kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy marchandise.

34. When thou shalt be broken by ye seas in the depths of the waters, thy marchandise and all thy multitude, which was in the mids of thee, shal fal.

35. All the inhabitantes of the yles shall be astonished at thee, and all their Kings shall be sore afraide and troubled in their countenance.

## Ezekiel 28

1. The woorde of the Lorde came againe vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy heart [is] lifted up, and thou hast said, 

3. Behold, thou [art] wiser than 

4. With thy wisedome and thine vnderstanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten golde and siluer into thy treasures.

5. By thy great wisedome and by thine occupying hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted vp because of thy riches.

6. Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde God, Because thou didest thinke in thine heart, that thou wast equall with God,

7. Behold, therefore I wil bring strangers vpon thee, euen the terrible nations: and they shall drawe their swordes against the beautie of thy wisedome, and they shall defile thy brightnes.

8. They shall cast thee downe to the pit, and thou shalt die the death of them, that are slaine in the middes of the sea.

9. Wilt thou say then before him, that slayeth thee, I am a god? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hands of him that slayeth thee.

10. Thou shalt die the deaths of the

Thou hast ben in Eden the garden of God: euery precious stone was in thy garment, the rubie, the topaze and the diamonde, the chrysolite, the onix, and the iasper, the saphir, emeraude, and the carbuncle and golde: the woorkemanship of thy timbrels, & of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.

14. Thou [art] 

15. Thou [wast] perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast 

16. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the 

17. Thine heart was lifted vp because of thy beautie, and thou hast corrupted thy wisedome by reason of thy brightnes: I wil cast thee to ye grounde: I will lay thee before Kinges that they may beholde thee.

18. Thou hast defiled thy

24. And they shalbe no more a pricking thorne vnto the house of Israel, nor any grieuous thorne of all that are round about them, and despised them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lorde God.

25. Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be 

26. And they shal dwell safely therein, & shall builde houses, and plant vineyards: yea, they shall dwell safely, when I haue executed iudgements vpon al round about them that despise them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord their God.

## Ezekiel 29

1. In the 

2. Sonne of man, set thy face against Pharaoh the King of Egypt, and prophecie against him, and against all Egypt.

3. Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great 

4. But I will put 

5. And I will leaue thee in the wildernes, both thee & al the fish of thy riuers: thou shalt fal vpon ye open field: thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: for I haue giue thee for meat to the beasts of the field, and to the foules of heauen.

6. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, because they have been a staff of 

7. When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and tear all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst break, and make all their inward parts to 

8. Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde God, Beholde, I will bring a sworde vpon thee, and destroy man and beast out of thee,

9. And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD: because he hath said, 

10. Behold, therefore I come vpon thee, and vpon thy riuers, & I will make the land of Egypt vtterly waste and desolate from the towre of Seueneh, euen vnto the borders of the blacke Mores.

11. No foote of man shall passe by it, nor foote of beast shall passe by it, neither shall it be inhabited fourtie yeeres.

12. And I wil make the land of Egypt desolate in the middes of the countries, that are desolate, and her cities shall be desolate among the cities that are desolate, for fourtie yeeres: and I wil scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and wil disperse them through the countreis.

13. Yet thus saieth the Lord God, At the end of fourtie yeeres will I gather the Egyptians from the people, where they were scattered,

14. And I will bring again the captives of Egypt, and will cause them to return [into] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a 

15. It shall be the smallest of the kingdomes, neither shall it exalt it selfe any more aboue the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule the nations.

16. And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth [their] 

17. And it came to pass in the 

18. Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great 

19. Therefore thus sayth the Lorde God, Beholde, I will giue the land of Egypt vnto Nebuchad-nezzar the King of Babel, and he shall take her multitude, and spoyle her spoyle, and take her pray, and it shall be the wages for his armie.

20. I haue giuen him the land of Egypt for his labour, that he serued against it, because they wrought for me, sayth the Lord God.

21. In that day will I cause the horne of the house of Israel to growe, and I will giue thee an open mouth in the middes of them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 30

1. The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,

2. Sonne of man, prophesie, and say, Thus sayth the Lord God, Howle and cry, Wo be vnto this day.

3. For the day is neere, & the day of the Lord is at hand, a cloudie day, and it shall be the time of the heathen.

4. And the sword shall come vpon Egypt, and feare shall be in Ethiopia, when the slaine shall fall in Egypt, when they shall take away her multitude, and when her foundations shall be broken downe.

5. 
          

6. Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of 

7. And they shall be desolate in the middes of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the middes of the cities that are wasted.

8. And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I haue set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

9. In that day shall there messengers go forth from me in shippes, to make the carelesse Mores aftaide, and feare shall come vpon them, as in the day of Egypt: for loe, it commeth.

10. Thus sayth the Lord God, I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel.

11. For he and his people with him, euen the terrible nations shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall drawe their swordes against Egypt, and fill the land with the slaine.

12. And I will make the riuers drye, and fell the land into the hands of the wicked, and I will make the land waste, and all that therein is by the hands of strangers: I the Lord haue spoken it.

13. Thus saith the Lord God, I will also destroy the idoles, and I will cause their idoles to cease out of Noph, and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt, and I will send a feare in the land of Egypt.

14. And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and I will execute iudgement in No.

15. And I will powre my wrath vpon Sin, which is the strength of Egypt: and I will destroy the multitude of No.

16. And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall haue great sorowe and No shalbe destroyed, and Noph shall haue sorowes dayly.

17. The yong men of Auen, and of Phibeseth shall fall by the sworde: and these cities shall goe into captiuitie.

18. At Tehaphnehes also the day 

19. Thus will I execute iudgements in Egypt, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord.

20. And it came to pass in the 

21. Son of man, 

22. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break 

23. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countreys.

24. And I will strengthen the arme of the King of Babel, and put my sworde in his hand, but I will breake Pharaohs armes, and he shall cast out sighings, as the sighings of him, that is wounded before him.

25. But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, 

26. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, & disperse them among ye countreys, and they shall knowe, that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 31

1. And it came to pass in the 

2. Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou 

3. Beholde, Asshur was like a cedar in Lebanon with faire branches, & with thicke shadowing boughes, and shot vp very hye, and his toppe was among the thicke boughes.

4. The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round his plants, and sent out her 

5. Therefore his height was exalted aboue all the trees of the fielde, and his boughes were multiplied, and his branches were long, because of the multitude of the waters, which the deepe sent out.

6. All the foules of the heauen made their nestes in his boughes, and vnder his branches did all the beastes of the fielde bring foorth their yong, and vnder his shadowe dwelt all mightie nations.

7. Thus was he faire in his greatnesse, and in the length of his branches: for his roote was neere great waters.

8. The cedars in the garden 

9. I made him faire by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, enuied him.

10. Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde God, Because he is lift vp on high, and hath shot vp his toppe among the thicke boughes, and his heart is lift vp in his height,

11. I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the 

12. And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are 

13. Vpon his ruine shall all the foules of the heauen remaine, and all the beastes of the fielde shall be vpon his branches,

14. So that none of all the trees by the waters shalbe exalted by their height, neither shall shoote vp their toppe among the thicke boughes, neither shall their leaues stand vp in their height, which drinke so much water: for they are all deliuered vnto death in the nether partes of the earth in the middes of the children of men among them that goe downe to the pit.

15. Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I 

16. I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to the grave with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall 

17. They also went downe to hell with him vnto them that be slaine with the sworde, and his arme, and they that dwelt vnder his shadowe in the middes of the heathen.

18. To whom 

## Ezekiel 32

1. And it came to pass in the 

2. Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou art like a young 

3. Thus sayth the Lord God, I will therefore spread my net ouer thee with a great multitude of people, and they shall make thee come vp into my net.

4. Then will I leaue thee vpon the land, and I will cast thee vpon the open field, and I wil cause all the foules of the heauen to remaine vpon thee, and I will fill all the beastes of the field with thee.

5. And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys 

6. I will also water with thy blood the land in which thou 

7. And when I shall 

8. All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set 

9. I will also trouble the heartes of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations and vpon the countries which thou hast not knowen.

10. Yea, I will make many people amased at thee, and their Kings shalbe astonished with feare for thee, when I shall make my sworde to glitter against their faces, and they shall be afraide at euery moment: euery man for his owne life in the day of thy fall.

11. For thus sayth the Lorde God, The sworde of the King of Babel shall come vpon thee.

12. By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall lay waste the 

13. I will destroy also all the beastes thereof from the great watersides, neither shall the foote of man trouble them any more, nor the hooues of beast trouble them.

14. Then will I make 

15. When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the countrey with all that is therein, shall be laid waste: when I shall smite all them which dwell therein, then shall they know that I am ye Lord.

16. This is the mourning wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for Egypt, and for all her multitude, sayeth the Lord God.

17. In the twelfth yeere also in the fifteenth day of the moneth, came the worde of the Lorde vnto me, saying,

18. Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and 

19. Whom dost thou pass 

20. They shall fall in the midst of [them that are] slain by the sword: 

21. The strong among the mighty shall speak to 

22. Asshur is there and all his companie: their graues are about him: all they are slaine and fallen by the sworde.

23. Whose graues are made in the side of the pit, and his multitude are rounde about his graue: all they are slaine and fallen by the sworde, which caused feare to be in the land of the liuing.

24. There [is] 

25. They haue made his bed in the mids of the slaine with al his multitude: their graues are round about him: all these vncircucised are slaine by the sworde: though they haue caused their feare in the land of ye liuing, yet haue they borne their shame with them that goe downe to the pitte: they are laide in the middes of them, that be slaine.

26. There [is] 

27. And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen 

28. Yea, thou shalt be broken in the middes of the vncircumcised, and lie with them that are slaine by the sworde.

29. There is Edom, his Kings, and all his princes, which with their strength are laied by them that were slaine by the sworde: they shall sleepe with the vncircumcised, and with them that goe downe to the pit.

30. There [are] the princes of the

32. For I have caused my 

## Ezekiel 33

1. Againe, the woorde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their territory, and set him for their 

3. If when hee seeth the sworde come vpon ye land, he blow the trumpet, & warne the people,

4. Then hee that heareth the sounde of the trumpet, and will not bee warned, if the sworde come, and take him away, his blood shall be vpon his owne head.

5. For he heard the sound of the trumpet, and woulde not bee admonished: therefore his blood shall be vpon him: but he that receiueth warning, shall saue his life.

6. But if the watchman shall see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword shall come, and take [any] person from among them, he is taken away in his 

7. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my 

8. When I say to the wicked, O wicked [man], thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I 

9. Neuerthelesse, If thou warne the wicked of his way, to turne from it, if he doe not turne from his way, he shall die for his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule.

10. Therefore, O thou son of man, speak to the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins [are] upon us, and we pine away in them, 

11. Say to them, [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, 

12. Therefore, thou son of man, say to the children of thy people, The 

13. When I shal say vnto the righteous, that he shall surely liue, if he trust to his owne righteousnes, and commit iniquitie, all his righteousnes shal be no more remembred, but for his iniquitie that he hath committed, he shall die for the same.

14. Again, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he shall turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and 

15. To wit, if the wicked restore the pledge, and giue againe that he had robbed, and walke in the statutes of life, without committing iniquitie, he shall surely liue, and not die.

16. None of his sinnes that he hath comitted, shal be mentioned vnto him: because he hath done that, which is lawful, and right, he shal surely liue.

17. Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equall: but their owne way is vnequall.

18. When the righteous turneth from his righteousnesse, and committeth iniquitie, he shall euen die thereby.

19. But if the wicked returne from his wickednesse, and doe that which is lawfull and right, hee shall liue thereby.

20. Yet yee say, The way of the Lord is not equall. O ye house of Israel, I will iudge you euery one after his waies.

21. And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our 

22. Now the 

23. Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, and saide,

24. Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, 

25. Wherefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the 

26. Ye stand upon your 

27. Say thus vnto them, Thus saieth the Lorde God, As I liue, so surely they that are in the desolate places, shall fall by the sword: and him that is in the open field, will I giue vnto the beasts to be deuoured: and they that be in the forts and in the caues, shall die of the pestilence.

28. For I will lay the land desolate and waste, and the pompe of her strength shall cease: and the moutaines of Israel shalbe desolate, and none shall passe through.

29. Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I haue laid ye land desolate & wast, because of al their abominations, that they haue committed.

30. Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are 

31. And they come to thee as the people come, and they sit before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they 

32. And loe, thou art vnto them, as a iesting song of one that hath a pleasant voyce, and can sing well: for they heare thy woordes, but they doe them not.

33. And when this commeth to passe (for loe, it will come) then shall they know, that a Prophet hath bene among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the woorde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD to the shepherds; Woe [be] to the 

3. Ye eat the 

4. The 

5. And they were scattered, because [there is] no shepherd: and they 

6. My sheepe wandred through all the mountaines, and vpon euery hie hill: yea, my flocke was scattered through al the earth, and none did seeke or search after them.

7. Therefore ye shepherds, heare the woorde of the Lord.

8. As I liue, sayeth the Lorde God, surely because my flocke was spoyled, and my sheepe were deuoured of all the beasts of the fielde, hauing no shepherde, neither did my shepherdes seeke my sheepe, but the shepherdes fedde them selues, and fedde not my sheepe,

9. Therefore, heare ye the word of the Lorde, O ye shepherds.

10. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from 

11. For thus sayeth the Lorde God, Beholde, I will search my sheepe, and seeke them out.

12. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep [that are] scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in 

13. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countreis, and will bring them to their owne lande, and feede them vpon the mountaines of Israel, by the riuers, and in all the inhabited places of the countrey.

14. I will feede them in a good pasture, and vpon the hie mountaines of Israel shal their folde be: there shall they lie in a good folde and in fat pasture shall they feede vpon the mountaines of Israel.

15. I will feede my sheepe, and bring them to their rest, sayth the Lord God.

16. I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up [that which was] broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the 

17. Also you my sheepe, Thus saieth the Lorde God, behold, I iudge betweene sheepe, & sheepe, betweene the rammes and the goates.

18. [Seemeth it] a small thing to you to have eaten up the good 

19. And my sheepe eate that which yee haue troden with your feete, and drinke that which ye haue troubled with your feete.

20. Therefore thus sayth the Lorde God vnto them, behold, I, euen I wil iudge betweene the fat sheepe and the leane sheepe.

21. Because ye haue thrust with side and with shoulder, & pusht al the weake with your hornes, till ye haue scattered them abroade,

22. Therefore wil I helpe my sheepe, and they shal no more be spoyled, & I wil iudge betweene sheepe and sheepe.

23. And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, [even] my servant 

24. And I the Lord will be their God, and my seruant Dauid shalbe the prince amog them. I the Lord haue spoken it.

25. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall 

26. And I wil set them, as a blessing, euen roud about my mountaine: and I will cause rayne to come downe in due season, & there shalbe raine of blessing.

27. And the 

28. And they shall no more be spoyled of the heathen, neither shall the beastes of the land deuoure them, but they shal dwell safely and none shal make them afrayd.

29. And I will raise up for them a 

30. Thus shall they vnderstande, that I the Lorde their God am with them, and that they, euen the house of Israel, are my people, sayth the Lord God.

31. And yee my sheepe, the sheepe of my pasture are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 35

1. Moreouer the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face against mount 

3. And say vnto it, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, O mount Seir, I come against thee, and I wil stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee desolate and waste.

4. I wil lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, & thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord.

5. Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed [the blood of] the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time [that their] 

6. Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee to blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not 

7. Thus will I make mount Seir desolate and waste, and cut off from it him that passeth out & him that returneth.

8. And I will fill his mountaines with his slayne men: in thine hilles, and in thy valleys and in all thy riuers shal they fall, that are slayne with the sworde.

9. I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not 

10. Because thou hast said, 

11. Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thy 

12. And thou shalt know, that I the Lord haue heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountaines of Israel, saying, They lye waste, they are giuen vs to be deuoured.

13. Thus with your mouthes ye haue boasted against me, & haue multiplied your words against me: I haue heard them.

14. Thus sayth the Lorde God, So shall all the world reioyce when I shal make thee desolate.

15. As thou diddest reioyce at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I doe vnto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea wholly, & they shall know, that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 36

1. Also thou sonne of man, prophesie vnto the mountaines of Israel, & say, Ye mountaines of Israel, heare the word of the Lord.

2. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the

Therefore ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lord God, Thus sayth the Lord God to the mountaines & to the hilles, to the riuers, and to the valleys, and to the waste, and desolate places, and to the cities that are forsaken: which are spoyled & had in derision of the residue of the heathen that are round about.

5. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who have 

6. Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the

8. But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall 

9. For behold, I come vnto you, & I wil turne vnto you, and ye shalbe tilled and sowen.

10. And I wil multiply the men vpon you, euen all the house of Israel wholly, & the cities shalbe inhabited, & the desolate places shalbe builded.

11. And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you according to your old estates, and will do better [to you] than 

12. Yea, I will cause men to walk 

13. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say to you, Thou 

14. Therefore thou shalt deuoure men no more, neither waste thy people henceforth, sayth the Lord God,

15. Neither will I cause men to heare in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou beare the reproche of the people any more, neither shalt cause thy folke to fal any more, saith the Lord God.

16. Moreouer the word of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

17. Sonne of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their owne lande, they defiled it by their owne wayes, & by their deedes: their way was before me as the filthinesse of the menstruous.

18. Wherfore I powred my wrath vpon them, for the blood that they had shed in the land, and for their idoles, wherewith they had polluted it.

19. And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries for according to their wayes, and according to their deedes, I iudged them.

20. And when they entred vnto the heathen, whither they went, they polluted mine holy Name, when they sayd of them, These are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his land.

21. But I had pity for my holy 

22. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not [this] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my 

23. And I wil sanctifie my great Name, which was polluted among the heathen, among whome you haue polluted it, and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, sayth the Lorde God, when I shalbe sanctified in you before their eyes.

24. For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your owne land.

25. Then will I sprinkle clean 

26. A newe heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit wil I put within you, and I will take away the stonie heart out of your body, and I will giue you an heart of flesh.

27. And I will put my spirite within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and ye shall keepe my iudgements and do them.

28. And ye shall dwell in the land, that I gaue to your fathers, and ye shalbe my people, & I will be your God.

29. I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the 

30. For I will multiplie the fruite of the trees, & the increase of the fielde, that ye shal beare no more the reproch of famine among the heathen.

31. Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall 

32. Be it knowen vnto you that I do not this for your sakes, sayth the Lord God: therefore, O ye house of Israel, be ashamed, and confounded for your owne wayes.

33. Thus sayth the Lord God, What time as I shall haue clensed you from all your iniquities, I will cause you to dwel in the cities, & the desolate places shalbe builded.

34. And the desolate land shalbe tilled, whereas it lay waste in the sight of all that passed by.

35. For they sayd, This waste land was like the garden of Eden, and these waste & desolate and ruinous cities were strong, and were inhabited.

36. Then the nations that are left around you shall 

37. Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be sought of ye house of Israel, to performe it vnto them: I wil encrease them with men like a flocke.

38. As the holy flocke, as the flocke of Ierusalem in their solemne feastes, so shall the desolate cities be filled with flockes of men, and they shal know, that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which [was] full of 

2. And he led me round about by them, and beholde, they were very many in the open fielde, and lo, they were very drie.

3. And he sayde vnto me, Sonne of man, can these bones liue? And I answered, O Lorde God, thou knowest.

4. Againe he sayde vnto me, Prophecie vpon these bones and say vnto them, O ye dry bones, heare the word of the Lord.

5. Thus saith the Lord God vnto these bones, Behold, I wil cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall liue.

6. And I will lay sinewes vpon you, & make flesh growe vpon you, & couer you with skinne, and put breath in you, that ye may liue, and yee shal know that I am the Lord.

7. So I prophecied, as I was commanded: and as I prophecied, there was a noyse, and beholde, there was a shaking, & the bones came together, bone to his bone.

8. And when I beheld, loe, the sinewes, & the flesh grewe vpon them, and aboue, the skinne couered them, but there was no breath in them.

9. Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four 

10. So I prophecied as hee had commaunded me: and the breath came into them, and they liued, and stood vp vpon their feete, an exceeding great armie.

11. Then he sayd vnto me, Sonne of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is gone, and we are cleane cut off.

12. Therefore prophecie, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God, Beholde, my people, I will open your graues, and cause you to come vp out of your sepulchres, and bring you into the lande of Israel,

13. And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, 

14. And shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall liue, and I shal place you in your owne land: then yee shall knowe that I the Lorde haue spoken it, and performed it, sayth the Lord.

15. The word of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,

16. Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take 

17. And thou shalt ioyne the one to another into one tree, & they shalbe as one in thine hand.

18. And when the children of thy people shall speake vnto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shewe vs what thou meanest by these?

19. Say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick 

20. And the pieces of wood, whereon thou writest, shalbe in thine hand, in their sight.

21. And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God, Beholde, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and wil gather them on euery side, & bring them into their owne land.

22. And I will make them one people in the lande, vpon the mountaines of Israel, and one king shalbe king to them all: and they shalbe no more two peoples, neither bee deuided any more henceforth into two kingdomes.

23. Neither shall they bee polluted any more with their idoles, nor with their abominatios, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will saue them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they haue sinned, and will clense them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

24. And Dauid my seruant shalbe king ouer them, and they all shall haue one shepheard: they shall also walke in my iudgements, and obserue my statutes, and doe them.

25. And they shall dwell in the 

26. Moreouer, I will make a couenant of peace with them: it shall be an euerlasting couenant with them, and I wil place them, and multiply them, and wil set my Sanctuarie among them for euermore.

27. My tabernacle also shalbe with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shalbe my people.

28. Thus the heathen shall knowe, that I the Lord do sanctifie Israel, when my Sanctuarie shall be among them for euermore.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the worde of the Lorde came vnto mee, saying,

2. Son of man, set thy face against 

3. And say, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I come against thee, O Gog the chiefe prince of Meshech and Tubal.

4. And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts [of armour, even] a great company [with] bucklers and shields, all of them 

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. Be thou prepared, and 

8. After many dayes thou shalt bee visited: for in the latter yeres thou shalt come into the land, that hath bene destroyed with the sworde, and is gathered out of many people vpon the mountaines of Israel, which haue long lien waste: yet they haue bene brought out of the people, and they shall dwell all safe.

9. Thou shalt ascende and come vp like a tempest, and shalt be like a cloude to couer the land, both thou, and all thy bandes, and many people with thee.

10. Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, [that] at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an 

11. And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; 

12. Thinking to spoyle the pray, and to take a bootie, to turne thine hande vpon the desolate places that are nowe inhabited, and vpon the people, that are gathered out of the nations which haue gotten cattell and goods, and dwell in the middes of the land.

13. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, shall say to thee, 

14. Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel 

15. And come fro thy place out of the North partes, thou and much people with thee? All shall ride vpon horses, euen a great multitude and a mightie armie.

16. And thou shalt come against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the 

17. Thus saith the Lord GOD; [Art] thou he of whom I have spoken of old 

18. At the same time also whe Gog shal come against the land of Israel, sayth the Lord God, my wrath shall arise in mine anger.

19. For in mine indignation and in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken it: surely at that time there shalbe a great shaking in the land of Israel,

20. So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, and all the men that [are] upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be overturned, and the 

21. And I will call for a sword against him 

22. And I will pleade against him with pestilence, and with blood, and I will cause to raine vpon him and vpon his bands, and vpon the great people, that are with him, a sore raine, and hailestones, fire, and brimstone.

23. Thus will I be magnified, and sanctified, and knowen in the eyes of many nations, & they shall knowe, that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 39

1. Therefore, thou sonne of man, prophecie against Gog, and say, Thus sayeth the Lorde God, Behold, I come against thee, O Gog, ye chiefe prince of Meshech and Tubal.

2. And I will turn thee back, 

3. And I will smite thy bowe out of thy left hand, and I will cause thine arrowes to fall out of thy right hand.

4. Thou 

5. Thou shalt fall vpon the open fielde: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God.

6. And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell securely in the 

7. So will I make mine holy Name knowen in the middes of my people Israel, and I will not suffer them to pollute mine holy Name any more, and the heathen shal knowe that I am the Lord, the holy one of Israel.

8. Behold, 

9. And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall 

10. So that they shall bring no wood out of the fielde, neither cut downe any out of the forestes: for they shall burne the weapons with fire, and they shall robbe those that robbed them, and spoyle those that spoyled them, sayeth the Lorde God.

11. And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will give to Gog 

12. 
          

13. Yea, all the people of the lande shall burie them, and they shall haue a name when I shall be glorified, saith the Lord God.

14. And they shall set apart men for [the] continual task of passing through the 

15. And the trauailers that passe through the land, if any see a mans bone, then shall he set vp a signe by it, till the buriers haue buried it, in the valley of Hamon-Gog.

16. And also the name of the citie shalbe Hamonah: thus shall they clense the land.

17. And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; 

18. Ye shall eate the flesh of the valiant, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of the weathers, of the lambes, and of the goates, and of bullockes, euen of all fat beastes of Bashan.

19. And ye shall eate fat till you be full, and drinke blood, till ye be drunken of my sacrifice, which I haue sacrificed for you.

20. Thus you shalbe filled at my table with horses and chariots, with valiant men, and with al men of warre, sayth the Lord God.

21. And I wil set my glory among the heathe, and all the heathen shall see my iudgement, that I haue executed, and mine hand, which I haue layed vpon them.

22. So the house of Israel shall knowe, that I am the Lord their God fro that day and so forth.

23. And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for 

24. According to their vncleannes, and according to their transgressions haue I done vnto the, and hid my face from them.

25. Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, Nowe will I bring againe the captiuitie of Iaakob, and haue compassion vpon the whole house of Israel, and wil be ielous for mine holy Name,

26. After that they haue borne their shame, & all their transgression, whereby they haue transgressed against me, whe they dwelt safely in their land, and without feare of any.

27. When I haue brought them againe from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies landes, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations,

28. Then shal they know, that I am the Lord their God, which caused them to be led into captiuitie among the heathen: but I haue gathered them vnto their owne land, and haue left none of them any more there,

29. Neither wil I hide my face any more from them: for I haue powred out my Spirit vpon the house of Israel, sayth the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the 

2. Into the lande of Israel brought he me by a diuine vision, & set me vpon a very hie mountaine, whereupon was as the building of a citie, toward the South.

3. And he brought me there, and, behold, [there was] a 

4. And the man said vnto me, Sonne of man, beholde with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and set thine heart vpon all that I shal shew thee: for to the intent, that they might be shewed thee, art thou brought hither: declare al that thou seest, vnto the house of Israel.

5. And beholde, I sawe a wall on the outside of the house round about: and in the mans hand was a reede to measure with, of sixe cubites long, by the cubite, and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the buylding with one reede, and the height with one reede.

6. Then came he vnto the gate, which looketh towarde the East, and went vp the stayres thereof, and measured the poste of the gate, which was one reede broade, and the other poste of the gate, which was one reede broade.

7. And euery chamber was one reede long, & one reede broad, & betweene the chambers were fiue cubites: & the post of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reede.

8. He measured also the porche of the gate within with one reede.

9. Then measured he the porch of the gate of eight cubites, and the postes thereof, of two cubites, and the porch of the gate was inward.

10. And the chambers of the gate Eastwarde, were three on this side, and three on that side: they three were of one measure, and the postes had one measure on this side, and one on that side.

11. And he measured the breadth of the entrie of the gate ten cubites, and the height of the gate thirteene cubites.

12. The space also before the chambers was one cubite on this side, and the space was one cubite on that side, and the chambers were sixe cubites on this side and sixe cubites on that side.

13. He measured then the gate from the roufe of a chamber to the toppe of the gate: the breadth was fiue and twentie cubites, doore against doore.

14. He made also postes of threescore cubites, and the postes of the court, and of the gate had one measure round about.

15. And vpon the forefront of the entry of the gate vnto the forefront of the porch of the gate within were fiftie cubites.

16. And there were narrowe windowes in the chambers, & in their postes within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and the windowes went rounde about within: and vpon the postes were palme trees.

17. Then brought he me into the outwarde court, and lo, there were chambers, & a pauement made for the court round about, & thirtie chambers were vpon the pauement.

18. And the pauement was by the side of the gates ouer against the length of the gates, and the pauement was beneath.

19. Then hee measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate without, vnto the forefront of the court within, an hundreth cubits Eastward and Northward.

20. And the gate of the outwarde court, that looked toward the North, measured he after the length and breadth thereof.

21. And the chambers thereof were, three on this side, and three on that side, and the postes thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fiftie cubites, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites.

22. And their windowes, and their arches with their palme trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the East, and the going vp vnto it had seuen steppes, and the arches therof were before them.

23. And the gate of the inner court stoode ouer against the gate towarde the North, and towarde the East, and hee measured from gate to gate an hundreth cubites.

24. After that, he brought mee towarde the South, and loe, there was a gate towarde the South, and hee measured the postes thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures.

25. And there were windowes in it, and in the arches thereof round about, like those windowes: the height was fiftie cubites, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites.

26. And there were seuen steps to go vp to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palme trees, one on this side, and another on that side vpon the post thereof.

27. And there was a gate in the inner court towarde the South, and he measured from gate to gate towarde the South an hundreth cubites.

28. And he brought me into the inner court by the South gate, and he measured the South gate according to these measures,

29. And the chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures, and there were windowes in it, and in the arches thereof rounde about, it was fiftie cubites long and fiue and twentie cubites broade.

30. And the arches round about were fiue and twenty cubites long, and fiue cubites broad.

31. And the arches thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof, and the going vp to it had eight steppes.

32. Againe he brought me into ye inner court toward the East, and he measured the gate according to these measures.

33. And the chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches thereof were according to these measures, and there were windowes therein, and in the arches thereof round about, it was fiftie cubites long, and fiue and twentie cubites broade.

34. And the arches thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof, on this side and on that side, & the going vp to it had eight steppes.

35. After he brought mee to the North gate, and measured it, according to these measures,

36. The chambers thereof, the postes thereof, and the arches thereof, and there were windowes therein round about: the height was fiftie cubits, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites.

37. And the postes thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof on this side, and on that side, & the going vp to it had eight steps.

38. And euery chamber, and the entrie thereof was vnder the postes of the gates: there they washed the burnt offring.

39. And in the porch of the gate stoode two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, vpon the which they slew the burnt offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespas offring.

40. And at the side beyond the steppes, at the entry of the North gate stoode two tables, and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate were two tables.

41. Foure tables were on this side, and foure tables on that side by the side of the gate, euen eight tables whereupon they slew their sacrifice.

42. And the foure tables were of hewen stone for the burnt offering, of a cubite and an halfe long, and a cubite and an halfe broade, and one cubite hie: whereupon also they layde the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offring and the sacrifice.

43. And within were borders an hand broade, fastened round about, and vpon the tables lay the flesh of the offring.

44. And without the inner gate were ye chambers of the singers in the inner Court, which was at the side of the North gate: and their prospect was towarde the South, and one was at the side of the East gate, hauing the prospect towarde the North.

45. And he said vnto me, This chamber whose prospect is towarde the South, is for the Priestes that haue the charge to keepe the house.

46. And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North, is for the Priestes that haue the charge to keepe the altar: these are the sonnes of Zadok among ye sonnes of Leui which may come neere to the Lord to minister vnto him.

47. So he measured the court, an hundreth cubites long, & an hundreth cubits broad, eue foure square: likewise the altar that was before ye house.

48. And hee brought mee to the porch of the house, and measured the postes of the porch, fiue cubites on this side, and fiue cubites on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubites on this side, and three cubites on that side.

49. The length of the porch was twentie cubites, and ye breadth eleuen cubites, & he brought me by the steps whereby they went vp to it, and there were pillars by the postes, one on this side, and another on that side.

## Ezekiel 41

1. Afterwarde, hee brought mee to the Temple, and measured the postes, sixe cubites broade on the one side, and sixe cubites broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the Tabernacle.

2. And the breadth of the entrie was tenne cubites, and the sides of the entrie were fiue cubites on the one side, and fiue cubites on the other side, and hee measured the length thereof fourtie cubites, and the breadth twentie cubites.

3. Then went hee in, and measured the postes of the entrie two cubites, and the entrie sixe cubites, and the breadth of the entrie seuen cubites.

4. So he measured the length thereof twentie cubites, and the breadth twentie cubites before the Temple; he sayde vnto mee, This is the most holy place.

5. After, he measured the wall of the house, sixe cubites, and the breadth of euery chamber foure cubites rounde about the house, on euery side.

6. And the chambers were chamber vpon chaber, three and thirtie foote high, and they entred into the wall made for the chambers which was round about the house, that the postes might bee fastened therein, and not be fastened in the wall of the house.

7. And it was large and went rounde mounting vpwarde to the chambers: for the staire of the house was mounting vpwarde, rounde about the house: therefore the house was larger vpward: so they went vp from the lowest chamber to the hiest by the middes.

8. I sawe also the house hie rounde about: the foundations of the chambers were a full reede of fixe great cubites.

9. The thickenesse of the wall which was for the chamber without, was fiue cubites, and that which remained, was the place of the chambers that were within.

10. And betwene the chambers was the widenes of twentie cubites round about the House on euery side.

11. And the doores of the chambers were toward the place that remained, one doore toward the North, and another doore toward the South, and the breadth of the place that remained, was fiue cubites round about.

12. Nowe the building that was before the separate place toward the West corner, was seuentie cubites broad, and the wall of the building was fiue cubites thick, round about, and ye length ninetie cubites.

13. So he measured the house an hundreth cubites long, and the separate place and the building with the walles thereof were an hundreth cubites long.

14. Also the breadth of the forefront of the house and of the separate place towarde the East, was an hundreth cubites.

15. And hee measured the length of the building, ouer against the separate place, which was behinde it, and the chambers on the one side and on the other side an hundreth cubites with the Temple within, and the arches of the court.

16. The postes and the narowe windowes, and the chambers round about, on three sides ouer against the postes, sieled with cedar wood rounde about, and from the ground vp to the windowes, and the windowes were sieled.

17. And from aboue the doore vnto the inner house and without, and by all the wall rounde about within and without it was sieled according to the measure.

18. And it was made with Cherubims and palme trees, so that a palme tree was betweene a Cherub and a Cherub: and euery Cherub had two faces.

19. So that the face of a man was towarde the palme tree on the one side, and the face of a lyon toward the palme tree on the other side: thus was it made through all the house round about.

20. From the grounde vnto aboue the doore were Cherubims and palme trees made as in the wall of the Temple.

21. The postes of the Temple were squared, & thus to looke vnto was the similitude and forme of the Sanctuarie.

22. The altar of wood was three cubites hie, and the length thereof two cubites, and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the sides thereof were of wood; he sayd vnto me, This is the table that shalbe before the Lord.

23. And the Temple and the Sanctuarie had two doores.

24. And the doores had two wickets, euen two turning wickets, two wickets for one doore, and two wickets for another doore.

25. And vpon the doores of the Temple there were made Cherubims and palmetrees, like as was made vpon the walles, and there were thicke plankes vpon the forefront of the porch without.

26. And there were narow windowes & palme trees on the one side, and on the other side, by the sides of the porch, and vpon ye sides of the house, and thicke plankes.

## Ezekiel 42

1. Then brought hee me into the vtter court by the way towarde the North, and he brought me into the chamber that was ouer against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the North.

2. Before ye length of an hundreth cubites, was the North doore, and it was fiftie cubites broad.

3. Ouer against the twentie cubites which were for the inner court, and ouer against the pauement, which was for the vtter court, was chamber against chamber in three rowes.

4. And before the chambers was a gallery of ten cubites wide, and within was a way of one cubite, and their doores towarde the North.

5. Nowe the chambers aboue were narower: for those chambers seemed to eate vp these, to wit, the lower, and those that were in the middes of the building.

6. For they were in three rowes, but had not pillars as the pillars of the court: therefore there was a difference from them beneath and from the middlemost, euen from the ground.

7. And the wall that was without ouer against the chambers, toward the vtter court on the forefront of the chambers, was fiftie cubites long.

8. For the length of the chambers that were in the vtter court, was fiftie cubites: and loe, before the Temple were an hundreth cubites.

9. And vnder these chambers was the entrie, on the East side, as one goeth into them from the outward court.

10. The chambers were in the thicknesse of the wall of the court towarde the East, ouer against the separate place, and ouer against the building.

11. And the way before them was after ye maner of the chambers, which were toward ye North, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their entries were like, both according to their facions, and according to their doores.

12. And according to ye doores of ye chambers that were towarde the South, was a doore in the corner of the way, euen the way directly before the wall toward the East, as one entreth.

13. The said he vnto me, The North chambers and ye South chambers which are before ye separate place, they be holy chambers, wherein the Priests that approch vnto ye Lord, shal eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meate offering, and the sinne offering, and the trespasse offring: for the place is holy.

14. When the Priestes enter therein, they shall not go out of the holy place into the vtter court, but there they shall lay their garmentes wherein they minister: for they are holy, and shall put on other garmentes, and so shall approch to those things, which are for the people.

15. Nowe when he had made an ende of measuring the inner house, he brought mee forth toward the gate whose prospect is towarde the East, and measured it round about.

16. He measured the East side with the measuring rod, fiue hundreth reedes, euen with the measuring reede round about.

17. He measured also the Northside, fiue hundreth reedes, euen with the measuring reede rounde about.

18. And he measured the South side fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reede.

19. He turned about also to the West side, and measured fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reede.

20. He measured it by the foure sides: it had a wall round about, fiue hundreth reedes long, and fiue hundreth broade to make a separation betweene the Sanctuarie, and the prophane place.

## Ezekiel 43

1. Afterwarde he brought me to the gate, euen the gate that turneth towarde the East.

2. And beholde, the glorie of the God of Israel came from out of the East, whose voyce was like a noyse of great waters, and the earth was made light with his glorie.

3. And [it was] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, [even] according to the vision that I saw 

4. And the 

5. So the Spirite tooke me vp and brought me into the inner court, and beholde, the glorie of the Lorde filled the house.

6. And I heard one speaking vnto me out of the house: and there stoode a man by me,

7. And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more 

8. Albeit they set their thresholdes by my thresholdes, and their postes by my postes (for there was but a wall betweene me and them) yet haue they defiled mine holy Name with their abominations, that they haue committed: wherfore I haue consumed them in my wrath.

9. Now therefore let them put away their fornication, and the carkeises of their Kings farre from me, and I will dwell among them for euer.

10. Thou sonne of man, shew this House to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their wickednes, & let them measure ye paterne.

11. And if they be ashamed of all that they haue done, shew them the forme of the House, & ye paterne thereof, & the going out thereof, & the coming in thereof, & the whole fashion thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the figures thereof, and all the lawes thereof: & write it in their sight, that they may keepe the whole fashio thereof, & all the ordinances thereof, & do them.

12. This is the description of the house, It shalbe vpon the toppe of the mount: all the limites thereof round about shalbe most holy. Beholde, this is the description of the house.

13. And these are the measures of the Altar, after the cubites, the cubite is a cubite, & an had breadth, euen the bottome shalbe a cubite, and the breadth a cubite, and the border thereof by the edge thereof rounde about shalbe a spanne: and this shalbe the height of the altar.

14. And from the bottome which toucheth the ground to the lower piece shalbe two cubites: and the breadth one cubite, and from the litle piece to the great piece shalbe foure cubites, and the breadth one cubite.

15. So the altar shalbe foure cubites, and from the altar vpward shalbe foure hornes.

16. And the altar shalbe twelue cubites long, and twelue broade, and fouresquare in the foure corners thereof.

17. And ye frame shalbe foureteene cubites log, and fourteene broade in the fouresquare corners thereof, & the border about it shalbe halfe a cubite, & the bottome therof shalbe a cubite about, & the steps thereof shalbe turned towarde ye East.

18. And he said vnto me, Sone of man, thus saith ye Lord God, These are ye ordinaces of ye altar in the day when they shall make it to offer the burnt offring theron, & to sprinkle blood theron.

19. And thou shalt giue to the Priestes, and to the Leuites, that be of the seede of Zadok, which approch vnto me, to minister vnto me, saith the Lord God, a yong bullocke for a sinne offring.

20. And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, & put it on the foure hornes of it, & on the foure corners of the frame, and vpon the border round about: thus shalt thou clense it, and reconcile it.

21. Thou shalt take the bullocke also of the sinne offring, and burne it in the appointed place of the house without the Sanctuarie.

22. But the second day thou shalt offer an hee goat wtout blemish for a sinne offring, & they shal clense ye altar, as they did clense it with the bullocke.

23. When thou hast made an ende of clensing it, thou shalt offer a yong bullocke without blemish, & a ram out of the flocke without blemish.

24. And thou shalt offer them before ye Lord, and the Priestes shall cast salt vpon them, & they shall offer them for a burnt offring vnto ye Lord.

25. Seuen dayes shalt thou prepare euery day an hee goate for a sinne offring: they shall also prepare a yong bullocke and a ramme out of the flocke, without blemish.

26. Thus shall they seuen dayes purifie the altar, and clense it, and consecrate it.

27. And when these dayes are expired, vpon the eight day and so forth, the Priests shall make your burnt offrings vpon the altar, & your peace offrings, & I will accept you, saith the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 44

1. Then he brought me towarde the gate of the outwarde Sanctuarie, which turneth towarde the East, and it was shut.

2. Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be 

3. It appertaineth to the Prince: the Prince himselfe shall sit in it to eate bread before the Lorde: he shall enter by the way of the porche of that gate, & shal go out by the way of the same.

4. Then brought he mee toward the North gate before the House: and when I looked, beholde, the glorie of the Lorde filled the house of the Lorde, and I fell vpon my face.

5. And the Lord sayd vnto me, Sonne of man, marke wel, & behold with thine eyes, & heare with thine eares, all that I say vnto thee, concerning al the ordinances of the house of the Lord, & al the lawes thereof, & marke well the entring in of the house with euery going forth of the Sanctuarie,

6. And thou shalt say to the rebellious, euen to ye house of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God, O house of Israel, ye haue ynough of al your abominatios,

7. In that ye have brought [into my sanctuary] 

8. And ye have not kept the 

9. Thus saieth the Lord God, No stranger vncircumcised in heart, nor vncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my Sanctuarie, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel,

10. And the 

11. And they shall serue in my Sanctuarie, and keepe the gates of the House, and minister in the House: they shall slay the burnt offring and the sacrifice for the people: and they shall stand before them to serue them.

12. Because they serued before their idoles, & caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquitie, therfore haue I lift vp mine had against the, saith the Lord God, and they shal beare their iniquity,

13. And they shal not come neere vnto me to do ye office of ye Priest vnto me, neyther shal they come neere vnto any of mine holy things in the most holy place, but they shall beare their shame & their abominatios, which they haue comitted.

14. And I will make them keepers of ye watch of the House, for all the seruice thereof, and for all that shalbe done therein.

15. But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that 

16. They shall enter into my Sanctuarie, and shall come neere to my table, to serue me, and they shall keepe my charge.

17. And whe they shal enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, & no wool shall come vpon the while they serue in ye gates of the inner court, & within.

18. They shall haue linnen bonets vpon their heades, and shall haue linnen breeches vpon their loynes: they shall not girde them selues in the sweating places.

19. But when they goe foorth into the vtter court, euen to the vtter court to the people, they shall put off their garments, wherein they ministred, and lay them in the holy chambers, & they shall put on other garments: for they shall not sanctifie the people with their garments.

20. Neither shall they 

21. Neither shall any Priest drinke wine when they enter into the inner court.

22. Neither shall they take for their wiues a widowe, or her that is diuorced: but they shall take maidens of the seede of the house of Israel, or a widow that hath bene the widow of a Priest.

23. And they shal teach my people the differece betweene the holy and prophane, & cause them to discerne betweene the vncleane & the cleane.

24. And in controuersie they shall stande to iudge, and they shall iudge it according to my iudgements: and they shall keepe my lawes and my statutes in all mine assemblies, and they shall sanctifie my Sabbaths.

25. And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may

27. And when he goeth into ye Sanctuarie vnto the inner court to minister in the Sanctuarie, he shall offer his sinne offring, saith ye Lord God.

28. And the Priesthood shall bee their inheritance, yea, I am their inheritance: therefore shall ye giue them no possessio in Israel, for I am their possession.

29. They shall eate the meat offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespas offring, and euery dedicate thing in Israel shal be theirs.

30. And all the first of all the first borne, & euery oblation, euen all of euery sort of your oblations shall be the Priestes. Ye shal also giue vnto the Priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

31. The Priests shal not eate of any thing, that is dead, or torne, whether it be foule or beast.

## Ezekiel 45

1. Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an 

2. Of this there shalbe for the Sanctuarie fiue hundreth in length with fiue hundreth in breadth, all square round about, and fiftie cubites rounde about for the suburbes thereof.

3. And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of fiue and twentie thousande, and the breadth of tenne thousande: and in it shalbe the Sanctuarie, and the most holy place.

4. The holy portion of the lande shalbe the Priests, which minister in the Sanctuarie, which came neere to serue the Lorde: and it shalbe a place for their houses, and an holy place for the Sanctuarie.

5. And in the fiue and twentie thousande of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall the Leuites that minister in the house, haue their possession for twentie chambers.

6. Also ye shall appoynt the possession of the citie, fiue thousand broad, and fiue and twentie thousand log ouer against the oblation of ye holy portion: it shalbe for the whole house of Israel.

7. And a portion shalbe for the prince on ye one side, and on that side of the oblation of the holy portion, & of the possession of the citie, euen before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the citie from the West corner Westward, and from the East corner Eastward, and the length shalbe by one of the portions fro the West border vnto the East border.

8. In this lande shalbe his possession in Israel: and my princes shal no more oppresse my people, and the rest of the land shall they giue to ye house of Israel, according to their tribes.

9. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it 

10. Ye shall have just balances, and a just 

11. The Ephah and the Bath shalbe equall: a Bath shall conteyne the tenth part of an Homer, and an Ephah the tenth part of an Homer: the equalitie thereof shalbe after the Homer.

12. And the shekel [shall be] twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, 

13. This is the oblation that ye shall offer, ye sixt part of an Ephah of an Homer of wheat, and ye shall giue the sixt part of an Ephah of an Homer of barley.

14. Concerning ye ordinance of the oyle, euen of the Bath of oyle, ye shall offer the tenth part of a Bath out of ye Cor (ten Baths are an Homer: for ten Baths fill an Homer)

15. And one lambe of two hundreth sheepe out of ye fat pastures of Israel for a meat offring, and for a burnt offring and for peace offrings, to make reconciliation for them, sayth the Lorde God.

16. All the people of the lande shall giue this oblation for the prince in Israel.

17. And it shalbe ye princes part to giue burnt offrings, and meat offrings, and drinke offrings in the solemne feasts and in the newe moones, & in the Sabbaths, and in all the hie feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sinne offring, and the meat offring, and the burnt offring, and the peace offrings to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

18. Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first [month], in the first [day] of the 

19. And the Priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offring, and put it vpon the posts of the house, and vpon the foure corners of the frame of the altar, and vpon the postes of the gate of the inner court.

20. And so shalt thou doe the seuenth day of the moneth, for euery one that hath erred and for him that is deceiued: so shall you reconcile the house.

21. In the first moneth in the foureteenth day of the moneth, ye shal haue the Passeouer, a feast of seuen dayes, & ye shal eate vnleauened bread.

22. And vpon that day, shal the prince prepare for him selfe, and for all the people of the lande, a bullocke for a sinne offring.

23. And in the seuen dayes of the feast he shal make a burnt offring to the Lorde, euen of seuen bullockes, and seuen rammes without blemish dayly for seuen dayes, and an hee goate dayly for a sinne offring.

24. And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and an 

25. In the seuenth moneth, in the fifteenth day of the moneth, shal he do the like in the feast for seuen dayes, according to the sinne offring, according to the burnt offring, and according to the meate offring, and according to the oyle.

## Ezekiel 46

1. Thus sayth the Lord God, The gate of the inner court, that turneth toward the East, shall be shut the sixe working dayes: but on the Sabbath it shalbe opened, and in the day of the newe moone it shalbe opened.

2. And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stande by the post of the gate, and the Priests shal make his burnt offring, and his peace offrings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: after, he shall go foorth, but the gate shall not be shut till the euening.

3. Likewise the people of the lande shall worshippe at the entrie of this gate before the Lorde on the Sabbaths, and in the newe moones.

4. And the burnt offring that the prince shall offer vnto the Lorde on the Sabbath day, shalbe sixe lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.

5. And the meat offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs 

6. And in the day of the newe moone it shalbee a yong bullocke without blemish, and sixe lambes and a ram: they shalbe without blemish.

7. And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs 

8. And when the prince shall enter, hee shall goe in by the way of the porche of that gate, and hee shall go foorth by the way thereof.

9. But when the people of the land shal come before the Lord in the solemne feastes, hee that entreth in by the way of the North gate to worship, shall goe out by the way of the South gate: & he that entreth by the way of the South gate, shall goe foorth by the way of the North gate: hee shall not returne by the way of the gate whereby hee came in, but they shall goe forth ouer against it.

10. And the prince shall be in the middes of them: hee shall go in when they goe in, & when they goe forth, they shal goe forth together.

11. And in the feastes, and in the solemnities the meat offring shalbe an Ephah to a bullocke, and an Ephah to a ram, and to the lambes, the gift of his hand, and an Hin of oyle to an Ephah.

12. Nowe when the prince shall make a free burnt offring or peace offrings freely vnto the Lord, one shall then open him the gate, that turneth towarde the East, and hee shall make his burnt offring and his peace offrings, as he did on the Sabbath day: after, hee shall goe foorth, and when he is gone forth, one shall shut the gate.

13. Thou shalt dayly make a burnt offring vnto the Lord of a lambe of one yere without blemish: thou shalt doe it euery morning.

14. And thou shalt prepare a meate offring for it euery morning, the sixt part of an Ephah, and the thirde part of an Hin of oyle, to mingle with the fine flowre: this meate offring shalbe continually by a perpetuall ordinance vnto the Lorde.

15. Thus shall they prepare the lambe, and the meate offring and the oyle euery morning, for a continual burnt offring.

16. Thus saith the Lorde God, If the prince giue a gift of his inheritance vnto any of his sonnes, it shalbe his sonnes, and it shall bee their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the 

18. Moreover the prince shall not 

19. After, he brought me through the entrie, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the Priestes, which stoode towarde the North: and beholde, there was a place at the West side of them.

20. Then said he to me, This [is] the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear [them] not out into the outer court, 

21. Then he brought me foorth into the vtter court, and caused me to goe by the foure corners of the court: and beholde, in euery corner of the court, there was a court.

22. In the foure corners of the court there were courts ioyned of fourty cubits long, & thirty broad: these foure corners were of one measure.

23. And there went a wall about them, euen about those foure, and kitchins were made vnder the walles rounde about.

24. Then said he vnto me, This is the kitchin where the ministers of the house shall seethe the sacrifice of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, 

2. Then brought he me out toward the North gate, and led me about by the way without vnto the vtter gate, by the way that turneth Eastward: & behold, there came forth waters on ye right side

3. And when the man that had the line in his hand, went foorth Eastward, he measured a thousand cubites, and he brought me through the waters: the waters were to the ancles.

4. Againe he measured a thousande, and brought me through the waters: the waters were to the knees: againe he measured a thousand, & brought me through: ye waters were to ye loynes.

5. Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass over: for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a 

6. And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, hast thou seene this? Then he brought me, and caused me to returne to the brinke of the riuer.

7. Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river [were] very many 

8. Then said he to me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the 

9. And it shall come to pass, [that] every thing that liveth, which moveth, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come there: for they shall be 

10. And it shall come to pass, [that] the 

11. But 

12. And by this riuer vpon the brinke thereof, on this side, and on that side shall grow all fruitful trees, whose leafe shall not fade, neither shall ye fruit thereof faile: it shal bring forth new fruit according to his moneths, because their waters run out of ye Sanctuarie: and the fruite thereof shalbe meat, and the leafe thereof shalbe for medicine.

13. Thus saith the Lorde God, This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherite the lande according to the twelue tribes of Israel: Ioseph shall haue two portions.

14. And ye shal inherite it, one as wel as another: concerning the which I lift vp mine hand to giue it vnto your fathers, and this lande shall fall vnto you for inheritance.

15. And this [shall be] the border 

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is betweene the border of Damascus, and the border of Hamath, & Hazar, Hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.

17. And the border from the sea shalbe Hazar, Enan, & the border of Damascus, and the residue of the North, Northwarde, and the border of Hamath: so shalbe the North part.

18. But the East side shall ye measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the lande of Israel by Iorden, and from the border vnto the East sea: and so shalbe the East part.

19. And the Southside shalbe towarde Teman from Tamar to the waters of Meriboth in Kadesh, and the riuer to the maine sea: so shalbe the South part towarde Teman.

20. The West parte also shalbe the great sea from the border, till a man come ouer against Hamath: this shalbe the West part.

21. So shall ye deuide this lande vnto you, according to the tribes of Israel.

22. And it shall come to pass, [that] ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel; 

23. And in what tribe the stranger dwelleth, there shall ye giue him his inheritance, saith the Lorde God.

11. It shalbe for the Priestes that are sanctified of the sonnes of Zadok, which haue kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Leuites went astray.

12. Therefore this oblation of the land that is offred, shalbe theirs, as a thing most holy by the border of the Leuites.

13. And ouer against the border of the Priests the Leuites shall haue fiue and twentie thousande long, and ten thousande broade: all the length shalbe fiue and twentie thousand, and the breadth ten thousande.

14. And they shall not sel of it, neither change it, nor abalienate the first fruites of the land: for it is holy vnto the Lorde.
