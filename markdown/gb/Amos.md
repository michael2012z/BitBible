1. The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of 

2. And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top 

3. Thus saith the LORD; For 

4. But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the

7. Therefore will I sende a fire vpon the walles of Azzah, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof.

8. And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the scepter from Ashkelon, and turne mine hande to Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistims shall perish, sayth the Lord God.

9. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the 

10. Therefore wil I send a fire vpon ye walles of Tyrus, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof.

11. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath 

12. Therefore will I send a fire vpon Teman, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Bozrah.

13. Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they 

14. Therefore will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battell, and with a tempest in the day of the whirlewinde.

15. And their King shall go into captiuitie, he and his princes together, saith the Lord.

2. Therefore will I send a fire vpon Moab, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Kerioth, and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.

3. And I will cut off the iudge out of the mids thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, sayth the Lord.

8. And they lay [themselves] down upon clothes laid to pledge 

9. Yet destroyed I the 

10. Also I brought you vp from the land of Egypt, and led you fourtie yeres thorowe the wildernesse, to possesse the land of the Amorite.

11. And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of 

12. But ye gaue the Nazarites wine to drinke, and commanded the Prophetes, saying, Prophecie not.

13. Behold, I am 

14. Therefore the flight shall perish from the 

15. Nor he that handleth the bowe, shal stand, and he that is swift of foote, shall not escape, neyther shall he that rideth the horse, saue his life.

16. And he that is of a mighty courage among the strong men, shall flee away naked in that day, sayth the Lord.

## Amos 3

1. Heare this worde that the Lord pronounceth against you, O children of Israel, euen against the whole familie which I brought vp fro the land of Egypt, saying,

2. You 

3. Can two walk together, except they be 

4. Will a 

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he 

8. The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but 

9. Publish in the palaces at 

10. For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery 

11. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, An aduersary shall come euen rounde about the countrey, and shall bring downe thy strength fro thee, and thy palaces shalbe spoyled.

12. Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh 

13. Heare, and testifie in the house of Iaakob, saith the Lord God, the God of hostes.

14. Surely in the day that I shal visit the transgressions of Israel vpon him, I wil also visite the altars of Beth-el, and the hornes of the altar shal be broken off, and fall to the ground.

15. And I wil smite the winter house with the sommer house, and the houses of yuorie shal perish, and the great houses shalbe consumed, sayth the Lord.

## Amos 4

1. Hear this word, ye 

2. The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with 

3. And ye shal goe out at the breaches euery kowe forward: and ye shal cast your selues out of the palace, saith the Lord.

4. Come to 

5. And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving 

6. And I also have given you 

7. And also I have withholden the rain from you, when [there were] yet three 

8. So two [or] three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were 

9. I haue smitten you with blasting, and mildewe: your great gardens and your vineyardes, & your figtrees, and your oliue trees did the palmer worme deuoure: yet haue ye not returned vnto me, saith the Lord.

10. I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of 

11. I have overthrown [some] of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a 

12. Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: [and] because I will do this unto thee, prepare to 

13. For lo, he that formeth the mountaines, & createth the winde, & declareth vnto man what is his thought: which maketh the morning darkenesse, & walketh vpon the hie places of the earth, the Lord God of hostes is his Name.

## Amos 5

1. Heare ye this worde, which I lift vp vpon you, euen a lamentation of the house of Israel.

2. The 

3. For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out [by] a thousand shall leave 

4. For thus saith the Lorde vnto the house of Israel, Seeke ye me, and ye shal liue.

5. But seek not Bethel, nor enter into 

6. Seeke the Lorde, and yee shal liue, least he breake out like fire in the house of Ioseph & deuoure it, & there be none to quench it in Beth-el.

7. Ye who turn 

8. [Seek him] that 

9. He strengtheneth the destroyer against the mightie: and the destroyer shal come against the fortresse.

10. They hate him 

11. Forasmuch therefore as your treading [is] upon the poor, and 

12. For I know your manifold transgressions, and your mightie sinnes: they afflict the iust, they take rewards, & they oppresse the poore in ye gate.

13. Therefore 

14. Seeke good and not euil, that ye may liue: and the Lorde God of hostes shalbe with you, as you haue spoken.

15. Hate the euil, and loue the good, and establish iudgement in the gate: it may bee that the Lorde God of hostes will be mercifull vnto the remnant of Ioseph.

16. Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing [shall be] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the 

17. And in al the vines shalbe lamentation: for I wil passe through thee, saith the Lord.

18. Woe unto you that 

19. As if a man did flee from a lyon, & a beare met him: or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

20. Shal not the day of the Lord be darkenes, and not light? euen darkenes and no light in it?

21. I hate and abhorre your feast dayes, and I wil not smell in your solemne assemblies.

22. Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, 

23. Take thou away from me the multitude of thy songs (for I wil not heare the melodie of thy violes)

24. But let judgment run down as 

25. Haue ye offered vnto me sacrifices and offrings in the wildernesse fourtie yeeres, O house of Israel?

26. But ye have borne the tabernacle of your 

27. Therefore wil I cause you to goe into captiuitie beyond Damascus, saith the Lorde, whose Name is the God of hostes.

## Amos 6

1. Woe to 

2. Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: [be 

3. Ye that put far away the 

4. They lie vpon beddes of yuorie, & stretch themselues vpon their beddes, & eate the lambes of the flocke, and the calues out of the stall.

5. That chant to the sound of the viol, [and] invent to themselves instruments of musick, like 

6. That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not 

7. Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the 

8. 
          

9. And if there remaine ten men in one house, they shal die.

10. And a man's uncle 

11. For behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the litle house with clefts.

12. Shall horses 

13. Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us 

14. But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of 

## Amos 7

1. Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed 

2. And when they had made an ende of eating the grasse of the land, then I saide, O Lorde God, spare, I beseeche thee: who shal raise vp Iaakob? for he is small.

3. The LORD 

4. Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, 

5. Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseeche thee: who shal raise vp Iaakob? for he is small.

6. So the Lord repented for this. This also shal not be, saith the Lord God.

7. Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall [made] by a plumbline, 

8. And the Lorde saide vnto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A line. Then said the Lord, Beholde, I wil set a line in the middes of my people Israel, and wil passe by them no more.

9. And the hye places of Izhak shalbe desolate, and the temples of Israel shalbe destroyed: and I wil rise against the house of Ieroboam with the sworde.

10. 
          

11. For thus Amos saith, Ieroboam shal die by the sworde, and Israel shalbe led away captiue out of their owne land.

12. Also 

13. But prophecie no more at Beth-el: for it is the Kings chappel, and it is the Kings court.

14. Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no 

15. And the Lord tooke me as I followed the flocke, and the Lord said vnto me, Go, prophecie vnto my people Israel.

16. Now therefore heare thou the word of the Lord. Thou sayest, Prophecie not against Israel, & speake nothing against the house of Izhak.

17. Therefore thus saith the LORD; 

## Amos 8

1. Thus hath the Lord God shewed vnto me, & behold, a basket of summer fruite.

2. And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of 

3. And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: [there shall be] many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast [them] forth with 

4. Hear this, O ye that 

5. Saying, When will the 

6. That we may buy the poore for siluer, and the needie for shooes: yea, and sell the refuse of the wheate.

7. The Lorde hath sworne by the excellencie of Iaakob, Surely I will neuer forget any of their workes.

8. Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and 

9. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the 

10. And I will turne your feastes into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I will bring sackcloth vpon all loynes, and baldnes vpon euery head: and I will make it as the mourning of an onely sonne, and the ende thereof as a bitter day.

11. Beholde, the dayes come, sayeth the Lorde God, that I will send a famine in the lande, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.

12. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the 

13. In that day shall the faire virgines and the yong men perish for thirst.

14. They that swear by the sin 

## Amos 9

1. I saw the Lord standing upon the 

2. Though they digge into the hel, thence shal mine hande take them: though they clime vp to heauen, thence will I bring them downe.

3. And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the 

4. And though they goe into captiuitie before their enemies, thence wil I commande the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes vpon them for euill, and not for good.

5. And the Lord God of hosts shall touch the land, and it shall melt away, & al that dwel therein shall mourne, and it shall rise vp wholy like a flood, and shall bee drowned as by the flood of Egypt.

6. [It is] he that buildeth his 

7. [Are] ye not as children of the Ethiopians 

8. Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD [are] upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly 

9. For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as [corn] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the 

10. But all the sinners of my people shall dye by the sword, which say, The euill shal not come, nor hasten for vs.

11. In that day will I raise up the 

12. That they may possess the remnant of 

13. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall 

14. 
          

15. And I wil plant them vpon their land, and they shall no more bee pulled vp againe out of their lande, which I haue giuen them, sayeth the Lord thy God.
