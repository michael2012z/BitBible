## 1 Peter 1

1. Peter an Apostle of Iesvs Christ, to the strangers that dwell here and there throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,

2. 
          

3. Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a 

4. To an inheritance immortall and vndefiled, and that withereth not, reserued in heauen for vs,

5. 
          

6. Wherein yee reioyce, though nowe for a season (if neede require) yee are in heauinesse, through manifolde tentations,

7. That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the 

8. Whome yee haue not seene, and yet loue him, in whome nowe, though yee see him not, yet doe you beleeue, and reioyce with ioy vnspeakeable and glorious,

9. Receiuing the ende of your faith, euen the saluation of your soules.

10. 
          

11. Searching when or what time the Spirite which testified before of Christ which was in them, shoulde declare the sufferings that should come vnto Christ, and the glorie that shoulde followe.

12. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost 

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. But as hee which hath called you, is holie, so be yee holie in all maner of conuersation;

16. 
          

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lambe vndefiled, and without spot.

20. 
          

21. Which by his meanes doe beleeue in God that raised him from the dead, and gaue him glorie, that your faith and hope might bee in God,

22. 
          

23. Being borne anewe, not of mortall seede, but of immortall, by the woorde of God, who liueth and endureth for euer.

24. 
          

25. 
          

## 1 Peter 2

1. Wherefore 

2. 
          

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, 

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. And a stone to stumble at, and a rocke of offence, euen to them which stumble at the woorde, being disobedient, vnto the which thing they were euen ordeined.

9. 
          

10. Which in time past were not a people, yet are nowe the people of God: which in time past were not vnder mercie, but nowe haue obteined mercie.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him 

15. 
          

16. As free, and not as hauing the libertie for a cloke of maliciousnesse, but as the seruauntes of God.

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. For what praise is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faultes, yee take it paciently? but and if when ye doe well, ye suffer wrong and take it paciently, this is acceptable to God.

21. 
          

22. Who did no sinne, neither was there guile found in his mouth.

23. Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but 

24. 
          

25. For ye were as sheepe going astray: but are nowe returned vnto the shepheard and Bishop of your soules.

## 1 Peter 3

1. Likewise, 

2. While they beholde your pure conuersation, which is with feare.

3. 
          

4. But [let it be] the 

5. 
          

6. Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. Let him eschew euil, and do good: let him seeke peace, and folow after it.

12. For the eyes of the Lord [are] over the righteous, and his ears [are open] unto their prayers: but the 

13. 
          

14. But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy [are ye]: 

15. But 

16. Hauing a good coscience, that whe they speake euill of you as of euill doers, they may be ashamed, which slander your good conuersation in Christ.

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. Which sometime were disobedient, when 

21. 
          

22. Which is at the right hande of God, gone into heauen, to whome the Angels, and Powers, and might are subiect.

## 1 Peter 4

1. Forasmuch 

2. That he no longer should live the 

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. Which shall giue accounts to him, that is readie to iudge quicke and dead.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. But if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not bee ashamed: but let him glorifie God in this behalfe.

17. 
          

18. And if the righteous scarcely bee saued, where shall the vngodly and the sinner appeare?

19. 
          

## 1 Peter 5

1. The 

2. 
          

3. Neither as being lords over [God's] 

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. Humble yourselves therefore 

7. Cast all your care on him: for he careth for you.

8. 
          

9. Whom resist stedfast in the faith, 

10. 
          

11. To him be glory and dominion for euer and euer, Amen.

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Greete ye one another with the kisse of loue. Peace be with you all which are in Christ Iesus, Amen.
