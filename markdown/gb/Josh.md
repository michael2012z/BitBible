## Joshua 1

1. Now after the 

2. Moses my seruant is dead: nowe therefore arise, go ouer this Iorden, thou, and all this people, vnto the lande which I giue them, that is, to ye children of Israel.

3. Euery place that the sole of your foote shall treade vpon, haue I giuen you, as I said vnto Moses.

4. From the 

5. There shall not a man be able to withstande thee all the dayes of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leaue thee, nor forsake thee.

6. Be strong and of a good courage: for vnto this people shalt thou deuide the lande for an inheritance, which I sware vnto their fathers to giue them.

7. Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that thou mayest 

8. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and 

9. Haue not I commanded thee, saying, Be strong and of a good courage, feare not, nor be discouraged? for I the Lord thy God will be with thee, whithersoeuer thou goest.

10. Then Ioshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

11. Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for 

12. And vnto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh spake Ioshua, saying,

13. Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this 

14. Your wiues, your children, and your cattell shall remaine in the land which Moses gaue you on this side Iorden: but ye shall goe ouer before your brethren armed, all that be men of warre, and shall helpe them,

15. Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant 

16. Then they answered Ioshua, saying, Al that thou hast commaunded vs, we will doe, and whithersoeuer thou sendest vs, we will goe.

17. According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, 

18. Whosoeuer shall rebell against thy commaundement, and will not obey thy wordes in all that thou commaundest him, let him bee put to death: onely be strong and of good courage.

## Joshua 2

1. And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of 

2. Then report was made to the King of Iericho, saying, Beholde, there came men hither to night, of the children of Israel, to spie out the countrey.

3. And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, 

4. (But ye woman had taken the two men, and hid them) Therefore saide she thus, There came men vnto me, but I wist not whence they were.

5. And when they shut the gate in the darke, the men went out, whither the men went I wote not: followe ye after them quickly, for ye shall ouertake them.

6. But she had brought them up to the 

7. And certaine men pursued after them, the way to Iorden, vnto the foordes, and as soone as they which pursued after them, were gone out, they shut the gate.

8. And before they were a sleepe, she came vp vnto them vpon the roofe,

9. And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your 

10. For we haue heard, howe the Lord dried vp the water of the redde Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt, and what you did vnto the two Kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Iorden, vnto Sihon and to Og, whom ye vtterly destroyed:

11. And as soon as we had heard [these things], our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for 

12. Now therefore, I pray you, sweare vnto me by the Lord; that as I haue shewed you mercie, ye will also shewe mercie vnto my fathers house, and giue me a true token,

13. And that yee will saue aliue my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they haue: and that yee will deliuer our soules from death.

14. And the men answered her, 

15. Then she let them downe by a corde thorowe the windowe: for her house was vpon the towne wall, and she dwelt vpon the wall.

16. And she said unto them, Get you to the 

17. And the men said unto her, 

18. Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this cord of red threde in the window, whereby thou lettest vs downe, and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother, and thy brethren, & all thy fathers houshold home to thee.

19. And it shall be, [that] whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, 

20. And if thou utter this our 

21. And she answered, According vnto your wordes, so be it: then she sent them away, & they departed, & she bound the red cord in ye window.

22. And they departed, and came into the mountaine, and there abode three dayes, vntil the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but founde them not.

23. So the two men returned, and descended from the mountaine, and passed ouer, and came to Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and tolde him all things that came vnto them.

24. Also they saide vnto Ioshua, Surely the Lorde hath deliuered into our handes all the lande: for euen all the inhabitants of the countrey faint because of vs.

## Joshua 3

1. And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to 

2. And it came to pass after 

3. And commanded the people, saying, When ye see the Arke of the couenat of the Lord your God, and the Priestes of the Leuites bearing it, ye shall depart from your place, and goe after it.

4. Yet there shalbe a space betweene you and it, about two thousande cubites by measure: ye shall not come neere vnto it, that ye may knowe the way, by the which ye shall goe: for ye haue not gone this way in times past.

5. (Nowe Ioshua had saide vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues: for to morowe the Lord will doe wonders among you)

6. Also Ioshua spake vnto the Priestes, saying, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and goe ouer before the people: so they tooke vp the Arke of the couenant, & went before the people.

7. Then the Lorde saide vnto Ioshua, This day will I begin to magnifie thee in the sight of all Israel, which shall knowe, that as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.

8. And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still 

9. Then Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel, Come hither, and heare the wordes of the Lord your God.

10. And Joshua said, 

11. Beholde, the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde of all the worlde passeth before you into Iorden.

12. Now therefore take you 

13. And assoone as the soles of the feete of the Priestes (that beare the Arke of the Lorde God the Lorde of all the worlde) shall stay in the waters of Iorden, the waters of Iorden shall be cut off: for the waters that come from aboue, shall stande still vpon an heape.

14. Then when the people were departed from their tentes to goe ouer Iorden, the Priestes bearing the Arke of the Couenant, went before people.

15. And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his 

16. Then the waters that came downe from aboue, stayed and rose vpon an heape and departed farre from the citie of Adam, that was beside Zaretan: but the waters that came downe towarde the Sea of the wildernes, euen the salt Sea, failed, and were cut off: so the people went right ouer against Iericho.

17. And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood 

## Joshua 4

1. And when all the people were wholy gone ouer Iorden, (after the Lord had spoken vnto Ioshua, saying,

2. Take you twelue me out of the people, out of euery tribe a man,

3. And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood 

4. Then Ioshua called the twelue men, whome he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of euery tribe a man,

5. And Ioshua said vnto them, Go ouer before the Arke of the Lorde your God, euen through the middes of Iorden, and take vp euery man of you a stone vpon his shoulder acccording vnto the nomber of the tribes of the children of Israel,

6. That this may be a sign among you, [that] when your 

7. Then ye may answere them, That the waters of Iorden were cut off before the Arke of the couenant of the Lord: for when it passed through Iorden, the waters of Iorden were cut off: therefore these stones are a memoriall vnto the children of Israel for euer.

8. Then ye children of Israel did euen so as Ioshua had commanded, & tooke vp twelue stones out of the mids of Iorden as ye Lord had said vnto Ioshua, according to the nomber of the tribes of the children of Israel, & caried them away with them vnto the lodging, & layd them down there.

9. And Joshua set up 

10. So the Priests, which bare ye Arke, stoode in the middes of Iorden, vntill euery thing was finished that ye Lorde had comanded Ioshua to say vnto the people, according to all that Moses charged Ioshua: then the people hasted & went ouer.

11. And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, 

12. And the sonnes of Reuben, & the sonnes of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh went ouer before the children of Israel armed, as Moses had charged them.

13. About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the 

14. That day the Lord magnified Ioshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses all dayes of his life.

15. And the Lord spake vnto Ioshua, saying,

16. Command the priests that bear the 

17. Ioshua therefore commanded the Priests, saying, Come ye vp out of Iorden.

18. And when the Priests that bare the Arke of the couenant of ye Lorde were come vp out of the middes of Iorden, and assoone as the soles of the Priests feete were set on the dry land, the waters of Iorde returned vnto their place, & flowed ouer all the bankes thereof, as they did before.

19. And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth [day] of the 

20. Also the twelue stones, which they tooke out of Iorden, did Ioshua pitch in Gilgal.

21. And he spake vnto ye childre of Israel, saying, When your children shall aske their fathers in time to come, & say, What meane these stones?

22. Then ye shall shew your children, and say, Israel came ouer this Iorden on dry land:

23. For the Lord your God dryed vp ye waters of Iorden before you, vntill ye were gone ouer, as the Lord your God did the red Sea, which hee dryed vp before vs, till we were gone ouer,

24. That all the people of the 

## Joshua 5

1. And it came to pass, when all the kings of the 

2. At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, 

3. And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at 

4. And this is the cause why Ioshua circumcised all the people, euen the males that came out of Egypt, because all the men of warre were dead in the wildernesse by the way after they came out of Egypt.

5. Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people [that were] born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, [them] they had 

6. For the children of Israel walked fourtie yeres in the wildernes, till all the people of the men of warre that came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord: vnto whome the Lord sware, that he would not shewe them the lande, which the Lorde had sworne vnto their fathers, that he would giue vs, euen a land that floweth with milke and hony.

7. So their sonnes whome he raysed vp in their steade, Ioshua circumcised: for they were vncircumcised, because they circumcised them not by the way.

8. And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they 

9. And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the 

10. So the children of Israel abode in Gilgal, and kept ye feast of the Passeouer the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen in ye plaine of Iericho.

11. And they did eat of the corne of the land, on the morow after the Passeouer, vnleauened breade, and parched corne in the same day.

12. And the MAN ceased on the morowe after they had eaten of the corne of the land, neither had the children of Israel MAN any more, but did eate of the fruite of the land of Canaan that yeere.

13. And when Ioshua was by Iericho, he lift vp his eyes and looked: and behold, there stood a man against him, hauing a sword drawen in his hand: and Ioshua went vnto him, and said vnto him, Art thou on our side, or on our aduersaries?

14. And he said, Nay; but [as] captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and 

15. And the captaine of ye Lords host said vnto Ioshua, Loose thy shoe of thy foote: for ye place wheron thou standest, is holy: and Ioshua did so.

## Joshua 6

1. Now Jericho was straitly 

2. And the Lorde saide vnto Ioshua, Behold, I haue giuen into thine hand Iericho and the King thereof, and the strong men of warre.

3. And ye shall compass the city, all [ye] men of war, [and] go round about the city 

4. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of 

5. And when they make a long blast with the rams horne, and ye heare the sound of the trumpet, al the people shal shoute with a great shoute: then shall the wall of the citie fall downe flat, and the people shall ascend vp, euery man streight before him.

6. Then, Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests & said vnto them, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and let seuen Priests beare seuen trumpets of rams hornes before the Arke of the Lord.

7. And he said unto the people, 

8. And when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people, the seuen Priestes bare the seuen trumpets of rams hornes, and went foorth before the Arke of the Lorde, and blew with the trumpets, & the Arke of the couenant of ye Lord followed them.

9. And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the 

10. (Nowe Ioshua had commaunded the people, saying, Ye shall nor shout, neither make any noyse with your voyce, neither shall a worde proceede out of your mouth, vntill the day that I say vnto you, Shout, then shall ye shoute)

11. So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about [it] 

12. And Ioshua rose early in the morning, and the Priestes bare the Arke of the Lord:

13. And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the 

14. And the second day they compassed the citie once, and returned into the host: thus they did sixe dayes.

15. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner 

16. And when the Priests had blowen ye trumpets the seuenth time, Ioshua said vnto ye people, Shoute: for the Lord hath giuen you the citie.

17. And the city shall be 

18. Notwithstanding, be ye ware of the execrable thing, lest ye make your selues execrable, and in taking of the execrable thing, make also the hoste of Israel execrable, and trouble it.

19. But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are] 

20. So the people shouted, whe they had blowen trumpets: for when the people had heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shoute: and the wall fel downe flat: so the people went vp into the citie, euery man streight before him: and they tooke the citie.

21. And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the citie, both man and woman, yong, and olde, and oxe, and sheepe, and asse, with the edge of the sword.

22. But Ioshua had said vnto the two men that had spied out the countrey, Go into the harlots house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware to her.

23. And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them 

24. And they burnt the city with fire, and all that [was] therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the 

25. And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she 

26. And Joshua adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: 

27. So the Lord was with Ioshua, and he was famous through all the world.

## Joshua 7

1. But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the 

2. And Joshua sent men from Jericho to 

3. And returned to Ioshua, and saide vnto him, Let not al the people go vp, but let as it were two or three thousand men go vp, and smite Ai, and make not al the people to labour thither, for they are fewe.

4. So there went vp thither of the people about three thousande men, and they fledde before the men of Ai.

5. And the 

6. Then Ioshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth vpon his face before the Arke of the Lord, vntill the euentide, he, and the Elders of Israel, and put dust vpon their heads.

7. And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the 

8. Oh Lord, what shal I say, when Israel turne their backes before their enemies?

9. For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it], and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great 

10. And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Get thee vp: wherefore lyest thou thus vpon thy face?

11. Israel hath sinned, and they haue transgressed my couenant, which I commanded them: for they haue euen taken of the excomunicate thing, and haue also stollen, and dissembled also, and haue put it euen with their owne stuffe.

12. Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their] backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye 

13. Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the 

14. In the morning therefore ye shall come according to your tribes, and the tribe which the Lord taketh, shal come according to the families: and the familie which the Lorde shall take, shall come by the housholds: and the houshold which the Lord shall take, shall come man by man.

15. And it shall be, [that] he that is 

16. So Ioshua rose vp earely in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes: and the tribe of Iudah was taken.

17. And he brought the families of Iudah, and tooke the familie of the Zarhites, and he brought the familie of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was taken.

18. And he brought his houshold, man by man, and Achan ye sonne of Carmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah of the tribe of Iudah was take.

19. And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and 

20. And Achan answered Ioshua, and saide, In deede, I haue sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus, and thus haue I done.

21. When I saw among the spoils a goodly 

22. Then Ioshua sent messengers, which ran vnto the tent, and beholde, it was hid in his tent, and the siluer vnder it.

23. Therefore they tooke them out of the tent, and brought them vnto Ioshua, and vnto all the children of Israel, and layd them before the Lord.

24. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the 

25. And Joshua said, 

26. And they cast vpon him a great heape of stones vnto this day: and so the Lord turned from his fierce wrath: therefore hee called the name of that place, The valley of Achor, vnto this day.

## Joshua 8

1. After, the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Feare not, neither bee thou faint hearted: take all the men of warre with thee and arise, go vp to Ai: beholde, I haue giuen into thine hand the King of Ai, and his people, and his citie, and his land.

2. And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city 

3. Then Ioshua arose, and all the men of warre to goe vp against Ai: and Ioshua chose out thirtie thousand strong men, and valiant, and sent them away by night.

4. And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye 

5. And I and all the people that are with me, will approche vnto the citie: and when they shall come out against vs, as they did at the first time, then will we flee before them.

6. For they wil come out after vs, till we haue brought them out of the citie: for they will say, They flee before vs as at the first time: so we will flee before them.

7. Then you shall rise vp from lying in waite and destroy the citie: for the Lord your God wil deliuer it into your hand.

8. And when ye haue taken the citie, ye shall set it on fire: according to the commandement of the Lord shall ye do: behold, I haue charged you.

9. Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night 

10. And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and 

11. Also all the men of warre that were with him went vp and drewe neere, and came against the citie, and pitched on the Northside of Ai: and there was a valley betweene them and Ai.

12. And he took about five thousand men, 

13. And when they had set the people, [even] all the host that [was] on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the 

14. And when the King of Ai sawe it, then the men of the citie hasted and rose vp earely, and went out against Israel to battell, hee and all his people at the time appointed, before the plaine: for he knew not that any lay in waite against him on the backeside of the citie.

15. And Joshua and all Israel 

16. And all the people of the citie were called together, to pursue after them: and they pursued after Ioshua, & were drawen away out of the city,

17. So that there was not a man left in Ai, nor in Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the citie open, and pursued after Israel.

18. And the LORD said unto Joshua, 

19. And they that lay in wait, arose quickly out of their place, and ranne as soone as he had stretched out his hand, and they entred into the citie, and tooke it, and hasted, and set the citie on fire.

20. And the men of Ai looked behinde them, and sawe it: for loe, the smoke of the citie ascended vp to heauen, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: for the people that fled to the wildernesse, turned backe vpon the pursuers.

21. When Ioshua and all Israel sawe that they that lay in waite, had taken the citie, and that the smoke of the citie mounted vp, then they turned againe and slewe the men of Ai.

22. And the 

23. And the King of Ai they tooke aliue, and brought him to Ioshua.

24. And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and 

25. And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelue thousande, euen all the men of Ai.

26. For Ioshua drewe not his hande backe againe which he had stretched out with the speare, vntill hee had vtterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

27. Onely the cattell and the spoyle of this citie, Israel tooke for a praye vnto themselues, according vnto the worde of the Lorde, which hee commaunded Ioshua.

28. And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for 

29. And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded 

30. Then Ioshua built an altar vnto the Lord God of Israel, in mount Ebal,

31. As Moses the seruant of the Lord had commaunded the children of Israel, as it is written in the booke of the Lawe of Moses, an altar of whole stone, ouer which no man had lift an yron: and they offered thereon burnt offrings vnto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.

32. And he wrote there upon the stones a 

33. And all Israel (and their Elders, and officers and their iudges stoode on this side of the Arke, and on that side, before the Priestes of the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde) as well the stranger, as he that is borne in the countrey: halfe of them were ouer against mount Gerizim, and halfe of them ouer against mount Ebal, as Moses the seruant of the Lorde had commaunded before, that they should blesse the people of Israel.

34. Then afterwarde hee read all the wordes of the Lawe, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the booke of the Lawe.

35. There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the 

## Joshua 9

1. And it came to pass, when all the kings which 

2. They gathered themselues together, to fight against Ioshua, & against Israel with one accord.

3. But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Ioshua had done vnto Iericho, and to Ai.

4. They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and 

5. And olde shoes and clouted vpon their feete: also the raiment vpon them was old, and all their prouision of bread was dried, and mouled.

6. So they came vnto Ioshua into the hoste to Gilgal, and said vnto him, and vnto the men of Israel, Wee be come from a farre countrey: nowe therefore make a league with vs.

7. And the men of Israel said unto the 

8. And they said vnto Ioshua, We are thy seruants. Then Ioshua saide vnto them, Who are ye? And whence come ye?

9. And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of 

10. And all that he hath done to the two Kings of the Amorites that were beyonde Iorden, to Sihon King of Heshbon, & to Og King of Bashan, which were at Ashtaroth.

11. Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our countrey spake to vs, saying, Take vitailes with you for the iourney, and go to meete them, and say vnto them, Wee are your seruants: now therefore make ye a league with vs.

12. This our 

13. Also these bottels of wine which we filled, were newe, and lo, they be rent, and these our garments and our shooes are olde, by reason of the exceeding great iourney.

14. And the 

15. So Ioshua made peace with them, & made a league with them, that he would suffer them to liue: also the Princes of the Congregation sware vnto them.

16. But at the end of three dayes, after they had made a league with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

17. And the children of Israel 

18. And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation 

19. Then all the Princes said vnto all the Congregation, We haue sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel: nowe therefore we may not touch them.

20. This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the 

21. And the Princes sayd vnto them againe, Let them liue, but they shall hewe wood, and drawe water vnto all the Congregation, as the Princes appoint them.

22. Ioshua then called them, and talked with them, and sayd, Wherefore haue ye beguiled vs, saying, We are very farre from you, when ye dwel among vs?

23. Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for 

24. And they answered Ioshua, and sayd, Because it was tolde thy seruants, that the Lord thy God had commanded his seruant Moses to giue you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land out of your sight, therefore we were exceeding sore afraid for our liues at the presence of you, and haue done this thing:

## Joshua 10

1. Now when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem had heard how Ioshua had taken Ai and had destroyed it, ( for as he had done to Iericho and to the King thereof, so he had done to Ai and to the King thereof) and howe the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them,

2. Then they feared exceedingly: for Gibeon was a great citie, as one of the royall cities: for it was greater then Ai, and all the men thereof were mightie.

3. Wherefore 

4. Come vp vnto me, and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for they haue made peace with Ioshua and with the children of Israel.

5. Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made 

6. And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua, euen to the hoste to Gilgal, saying, Withdrawe not thine hand from thy seruants: come vp to vs quickly, and saue vs, & helpe vs: for all the Kings of the Amorites which dwell in the mountaines, are gathered together against vs.

7. So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and all the men of might.

8. And the LORD said unto Joshua, 

9. Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly: for he went vp from Gilgal all the night.

10. And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth vp to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah.

11. And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, [and] were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: [they were] more which died with 

12. Then spake Ioshua to the Lord, in the day when the Lord gaue the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he sayd in the sight of Israel, Sunne, stay thou in Gibeon, and thou moone, in the valley of Aialon.

13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. [Is] not this written in the book of 

14. And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD 

15. After, Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him vnto the campe to Gilgal:

16. But the fiue Kings fled and were hid in a caue at Makkedah.

17. And it was tolde Ioshua, saying, The fiue Kings are found hid in a caue at Makkedah.

18. Then Ioshua said, Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men by it for to keepe them.

19. But stand ye not still: followe after your enemies, and smite all the hindmost, suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lorde your God hath giuen them into your hand.

20. And when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an ende of slaying them with an exceeding great slaughter till they were consumed, and the rest that remained of them were entred into walled cities,

21. And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in 

22. After, Ioshua sayd, Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out these fiue Kings vnto me forth of the caue.

23. And they did so, & brought out those fiue Kings vnto him forth of the caue, euen the King of Ierusalem, the King of Hebron, ye King of Iarmuth, the King of Lachish, and the King of Eglon.

24. And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the 

25. And Ioshua sayd vnto them, Feare not, nor be faint hearted, but be strong and of a good courage: for thus will the Lord doe to all your enemies, against whome ye fight.

26. So then Ioshua smote them, and slewe them, and hanged them on fiue trees, and they hanged still vpon the trees vntill the euening.

27. And at the going downe of the sunne, Ioshua gaue commaundement, that they should take them downe off the trees, and cast them into the caue (wherein they had bene hid) and they layde great stones vpon the caues mouth, which remaine vntill this day.

28. And that same day Ioshua tooke Makkedah & smote it with the edge of the sword, and the King thereof destroyed he with them, and all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: for hee did to the King of Makkedah as he had done vnto the King of Iericho.

29. Then Ioshua went from Makkedah, and all Israel with him vnto Libnah, and fought against Libnah.

30. And the Lorde gaue it also and the King thereof into the hand of Israel: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein: he let none remaine in it: for he did vnto the King thereof, as he had done vnto the King of Iericho.

31. And Ioshua departed from Libnah, and all Israel with him vnto Lachish, and besieged it, and assaulted it.

32. And the Lord gaue Lachish into the hand of Israel, which tooke it the second day, & smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein, according to all as he had done to Libnah.

33. Then Horam King of Gezer came vp to helpe Lachish: but Ioshua smote him and his people, vntill none of his remained.

34. And from Lachish Ioshua departed vnto Eglon, and all Israel with him, & they besieged it, and assaulted it,

35. And they tooke it the same day, & smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein he vtterly destroyed the same day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

36. Then Ioshua went vp from Eglon, and all Israel with him vnto Hebron, and they fought against it.

37. And when they had taken it, they smote it with the edge of the sword, & the King thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the soules that were therein: he left none remaining, according to all as he had done to Eglon: for he destroyed it vtterly, and all the soules that were therein.

38. So Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against it.

39. And when he had taken it, and the King thereof, and all the citie thereof, they smote them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: as he did to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the King thereof, as he had also done to Libnah, and to the King thereof.

40. So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the 

41. And Ioshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea euen vnto Azzah, and all the countrey of Goshen, euen vnto Gibeon.

42. And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at

5. So all these Kings met together, and came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, for to fight against Israel.

6. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt 

7. Then came Ioshua and al the men of warre with him against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell vpon them.

8. And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto 

9. And Ioshua did vnto them as the Lorde bade him: he houghed their horses, & burnt their charets with fire.

10. At that time also Ioshua turned backe, and tooke Hazor, & smote the King thereof with the sword: for Hazor before time was the head of all those kingdomes.

11. And they smote all the 

12. So all ye cities of those Kings, & all the kings of them did Ioshua take, & smote them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed them, as Moses the seruant of the Lord had commaunded.

13. But [as for] the cities that stood still in their

15. As the Lorde had commaunded Moses his seruant, so did Moses commande Ioshua, and so did Ioshua: he left nothing vndone of all that the Lord had commaunded Moses.

16. So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the 

17. [Even] from the mount 

18. Ioshua made warre long time with all those Kings,

19. Neither was there any citie that made peace with the children of Israel, saue those Hiuites that inhabited Gibeon: all other they tooke by battell.

20. For it was of the LORD to

22. There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, 

23. So Ioshua tooke the whole land, according to all that the Lorde had saide vnto Moses: and Ioshua gaue it for an inheritance vnto Israel according to their portion through their tribes: then the land was at rest without warre.

12. All the kingdome of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei: (who remained of the rest of the gyants) for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

13. Nevertheless the children of Israel 

14. Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire [are] 

15. Moses then gaue vnto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance, according to their families.

16. And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the brinke of the riuer Arnon, and from the citie that is in the middes of the riuer, and all the plaine which is by Medeba:

33. But vnto the tribe of Leui Moses gaue none inheritance: for the Lorde God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said vnto them.

## Joshua 14

1. These also are the places which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them,

8. Nevertheless my

10. Therefore beholde nowe, the Lorde hath kept me aliue, as he promised: this is the fourtie and fift yeere since the Lord spake this thing vnto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wildernes: and nowe loe, I am this day foure score and fiue yeere olde:

11. And yet am as strong at this time, as I was when Moses sent me: as strong as I was then, so strong am I nowe, either for warre, or for gouernment.

12. Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims [were] there, and [that] the cities [were] great [and] fenced: 

13. Then Ioshua blessed him, and gaue vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, Hebron for an inheritance.

14. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite, vnto this day: because he followed constantly the Lord God of Israel.

4. From thence went it along to Azmon, and reached vnto the riuer of Egypt, and the end of that coast was on the Westside: this shall be your South coast.

5. And the east border [was] the salt sea, [even] unto the

8. Then this border goeth vp to the valley of the sonne of Hinnom; on the Southside of the Iebusites: the same is Ierusalem. Also this border goeth vp to the top of the mountaine that lyeth before the valley of Hinnom Westward, which is by the end of the valley of ye gyants Northward.

9. So this border compasseth from the top of the mountaine vnto the fountaine of the water of Nephtoah, & goeth out to the cities of mount Ephron: and this border draweth to Baalah, which is Kiriath-iearim.

10. Then this border compasseth from Baalah Westward vnto mount Seir, and goeth along vnto the side of mount Iearim, which is Chesalon on the Northside: so it commeth downe to Bethshemesh, and goeth to Timnah.

11. And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the

13. Neuerthelesse, when the children of Israel were strong, they put the Canaanites vnder tribute, but cast them not out wholy.

14. And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me [but] one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I [am] a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath 

15. And Joshua answered them, If thou [be] a great people, [then] get thee up to the wood [country], and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, 

16. Then the children of Ioseph saide, The mountaine will not be ynough for vs: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the lowe countrey haue charets of yron, aswell they in Beth-shean, and in the townes of the same, as they in the valley of Izreel.

17. And Ioshua spake vnto the house of Ioseph, to Ephraim, and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power, and shalt not haue one lot.

18. But the mountain shall be thine; for it [is] a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine:

4. Give out from among you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to

## Joshua 22

1. Then 

2. And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD 

3. You haue not forsaken your brethren this long season vnto this day, but haue diligently kept the commandement of the Lord your God.

4. And nowe the Lorde hath giuen rest vnto your brethren as he promised them: therefore nowe returne ye and goe to your tentes, to the land of your possession, which Moses the seruant of the Lord hath giuen you beyond Iorden.

5. But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to 

6. So Joshua 

7. Nowe vnto one halfe of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had giuen a possession in Bashan: and vnto the other halfe thereof gaue Ioshua among their brethren on this side Iorden Westwarde: therefore when Ioshua sent them away vnto their tents, and blessed them,

8. And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your 

9. So the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel from Shiloh (which is in the land of Canaan) to goe vnto the countrey of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had obteyned, according to ye word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

10. And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that [are] in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built 

11. When the children of Israel heard say, Beholde, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the halfe tribe of Manasseh haue built an altar in the forefront of the lande of Canaan vpon the borders of Iorden at the passage of the children of Israel:

12. And when the children of Israel heard [of it], the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up 

13. Then the children of Israel sent vnto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to ye halfe tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest,

14. And with him ten princes, of euery chiefe house a prince, according to all the tribes of Israel: for euery one was chiefe of their fathers housholde among the thousands of Israel.

15. So they went vnto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the halfe tribe of Manasseh, vnto the land of Gilead, and spake with them, saying,

16. Thus saith 

17. [Is] the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not 

18. Ye also are turned away this day from the Lord: and seeing ye rebell to day against ye Lord, euen to morowe he will be wroth with all the Congregation of Israel.

19. Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession [be] 

20. Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man 

21. Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh answered, and saide vnto the heads ouer the thousands of Israel,

22. The Lorde God of gods, the Lorde God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel himselfe shal know: if by rebellion, or by transgression against ye Lord we haue done it, saue thou vs not this day.

23. That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD 

24. And if we haue not rather done it for feare of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might say vnto our children, What haue ye to doe with the Lord God of Israel?

25. For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children 

26. Therefore we said, We will nowe go about to make vs an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,

27. But it shall be a witnesse betweene vs and you, and betweene our generations after vs, to execute the seruice of the Lorde before him in our burnt offerings, and in our sacrifices, and in our peace offerings, and that your children should not say to our children in time to come, Ye haue no part in the Lord.

28. Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should [so] say to us or to our 

29. God forbid, that we should rebell against the Lord, and turne this day away from the Lorde to builde an altar for burnt offering, or for meate offering, or for sacrifice, saue the altar of the Lord our God, that is before his Tabernacle.

30. And when Phinehas the Priest, and the princes of the Congregation and heads ouer the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the wordes, that the children of Reuben, and children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spake, they were well content.

31. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD [is] 

32. Then Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest with the princes returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, vnto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them answere.

33. And the saying pleased the children of Israel: and the children of Israel blessed God, and minded not to goe against them in battell, for to destroy the land, wherein the children of Reuben, and Gad dwelt.

34. Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witnesse betweene vs, that the Lord is God.

## Joshua 23

1. And a long season after that the Lord had giuen rest vnto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Ioshua was olde, and stricken in age,

2. Then Ioshua called all Israel, and their Elders, and their heads, and their iudges, and their officers, and said vnto them, I am old, and stricken in age.

3. And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations 

4. Beholde, I haue deuided vnto you by lot these nations that remaine, to be an inheritance according to your tribes, from Iorden, with all the nations that I haue destroyed, euen vnto the great Sea Westward.

5. And the LORD your God, he shall expel 

6. Be ye therefore of a valiant courage, to obserue and doe all that is written in the booke of the Lawe of Moses, that ye turne not therefrom to the right hand nor to the left,

7. That ye come not among these nations, these that 

8. But sticke fast vnto the Lord your God, as ye haue done vnto this day.

9. For ye Lorde hath cast out before you great nations and mightie, and no man hath stand before your face hitherto.

10. One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

11. Take good heede therefore vnto your selues, that ye loue the Lord your God.

12. Els, if ye goe backe, and cleaue vnto the rest of these nations: that is, of them that remaine with you, and shall make marriages with them, and goe vnto them, and they to you,

13. Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out [any of] these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your 

14. And, behold, this day I [am] 

15. Therefore as all good things are come vpon you, which the Lorde your God promised you, so shall the Lord bring vpon you euery euill thing, vntill he haue destroyed you out of this good land, which ye Lord your God hath giue you.

## Joshua 24

1. And Joshua gathered all the 

2. And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the 

3. And I tooke your father Abraham from beyond the flood, and brought him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seede, and gaue him Izhak.

4. And I gaue vnto Izhak, Iaakob and Esau: and I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir, to possesse it: but Iaakob and his children went downe into Egypt.

5. I sent Moses also & Aaron, and I plagued Egypt: and when I had so done among them, I brought you out.

6. So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came vnto the Sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with charets and horsemen vnto the red sea.

7. And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a 

8. After, I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt beyond Iorden, and they fought with you: but I gaue them into your hand, and ye possessed their countrey, and I destroyed them out of your sight.

9. Also Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab arose and warred against Israel, and sent to call Balaam the sonne of Beor for to curse you,

10. But I would not heare Balaam: therefore he blessed you, and I deliuered you out of his hand.

11. And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the 

12. And I sent hornets before you, which cast them out before you, euen the two kings of the Amorites, and not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

13. And I haue giuen you a land, wherein ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and yee dwell in them, and eate of the vineyards and oliue trees, which yee planted not.

14. Now therefore 

15. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that [were] on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: 

16. Then the people answered and saide, God forbid, that we shoulde forsake the Lord, to serue other gods.

17. For the Lorde our God, he brought vs and our fathers out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and he did those great miracles in our sight, and preserued vs in all the way that we went, and among all the people through whome we came.

18. And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: [therefore] will we also serve the LORD; 

19. And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Ye can not serue the Lorde: for he is an holie God: he is a ielous God: hee will not pardon your iniquitie nor your sinnes.

20. If yee forsake the Lorde and serue strange gods, then he will returne and bring euill vpon you, and consume you, after that hee hath done you good.

21. And the people saide vnto Ioshua, Nay, but we will serue the Lord.

22. And Joshua said unto the people, Ye [are] witnesses 

23. Now therefore put away, [said he], the strange 

24. And ye people saide vnto Ioshua, The Lord our God wil we serue, & his voyce wil we obey.

25. So Joshua 

26. And Ioshua wrote these woordes in the booke of the Lawe of God, and tooke a great stone, and pitched it there vnder an oke that was in the Sanctuarie of the Lord.

27. And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it 

28. Then Ioshua let the people depart, euery man vnto his inheritance.

29. And after these things Ioshua the sonne of Nun, the seruaunt of the Lord died, being an hundreth and ten yeeres olde.

30. And they buried him in ye border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the Northside of mount Gaash.

31. And Israel 

32. And the bones of Ioseph, which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in a parcell of ground which Iaakob bought of the sonnes of Hamor the father of Shechem, for an hundreth pieces of siluer, and the children of Ioseph had them in their inheritance.

33. Also Eleazar the sonne of Aaron died, whome they buried in the hill of Phinehas his sonne, which was giuen him in mount Ephraim.
