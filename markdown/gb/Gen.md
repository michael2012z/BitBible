3. And God said, Let there be light: and there was 

4. And God sawe the light that it was good, and God separated the light from the darkenes.

5. And God called the light, Day, and the darkenes, he called Night. So the euening and the morning were the first day.

6. Againe God saide, Let there be a firmament in the middes of the waters: and let it separate the waters from the waters.

7. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] 

8. And God called the firmament 

9. God saide againe, Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appeare; it was so.

10. And God called the dry land, Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters, Seas: and God sawe that it was good.

11. And God said, 

12. And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God 

13. So the euening and the morning were the third day.

14. And God said, Let there be 

15. And let them be for lightes in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth; it was so.

16. And God made two great 

17. And God set them in the firmament of the heauen, to shine vpon the earth,

18. And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to separate the light from the darkenes: and God sawe that it was good.

19. So the euening and the morning were the fourth day.

20. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the

24. Moreouer God said, Let the earth bring foorth the liuing thing according to his kinde, cattell, and that which creepeth, and the beast of the earth, according to his kinde; it was so.

25. And God made the beast of the earth according to his kinde, and the cattell according to his kinde, & euery creeping thing of the earth according to his kind: & God saw that it was good.

26. And God said, 

27. Thus God created the man in his image: in the image of God created he him: he created them male and female.

28. And God 

29. And God said, Behold, I have given you 

30. Likewise to euery beast of the earth, and to euery foule of the heauen, and to euery thing that moueth vpon the earth, which hath life in it selfe, euery greene herbe shall be for meate; it was so.

31. And God sawe all that he had made, and loe, it was very good. So the euening and the morning were the sixt day.

## Genesis 2

1. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the 

2. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he 

3. And God blessed the seventh day, and 

4. These are the generations of the heauens and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lorde God made the earth and the heauens,

5. And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to 

6. But a myst went vp from the earth, and watered all the earth.

7. And the LORD God formed man 

8. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in 

9. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the 

10. And out of Eden went a riuer to water the garden, and from thence it was deuided, and became into foure heads.

11. The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land 

12. And the golde of that land is good: there is Bdelium, and the Onix stone.

13. And the name of the seconde riuer is Gihon: the same compasseth the whole lande of Cush.

14. The name also of the third riuer is Hiddekel: this goeth toward the Eastside of Asshur: and the fourth riuer is Perath)

15. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to 

16. And the LORD God 

17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely 

18. Also the Lorde God saide, It is not good that the man should be himself alone: I wil make him an helpe meete for him.

19. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto 

20. The man therefore gaue names vnto all cattell, and to the foule of the heauen, and to euery beast of the fielde: but for Adam founde he not an helpe meete for him.

21. Therefore the Lord God caused an heauie sleepe to fall vpon the man, and he slept: and he tooke one of his ribbes, & closed vp the flesh in steade thereof.

22. And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a 

23. Then the man said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shalbe called woman, because she was taken out of man.

24. Therefore shall a man leave

1. Now the serpent was more 

2. And the woman said vnto the serpent, We eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden,

3. But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, 

4. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely 

5. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, 

6. And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he 

7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they 

8. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife 

9. But the Lord God called to the man, and said vnto him, Where art thou?

10. And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] 

11. And he saide, Who tolde thee, that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eate?

12. And the man said, The woman whom thou 

13. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, 

14. And the LORD God said unto the serpent, 

15. And I will put enmity between 

16. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy 

17. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: 

18. 
          

19. In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne to the earth: for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne.

20. (And the man called his wiues name Heuah, because she was the mother of all liuing)

21. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God 

22. And the LORD God said, 

23. Therefore the Lord God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden, to till ye earth, whence he was taken.

24. Thus he cast out man, and at the East side of the garden of Eden he set the Cherubims, and the blade of a sworde shaken, to keepe the way of the tree of life.

## Genesis 4

1. And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she 

2. And againe she brought foorth his brother Habel, & Habel was a keeper of sheepe, and Kain was a tiller of the ground.

3. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an 

4. And Habel also him selfe brought of the first fruites of his sheepe, and of the fat of them, and the Lorde had respect vnto Habel, and to his offering,

5. But vnto Kain and to his offering he had no regarde: wherefore Kain was exceeding wroth, and his countenance fell downe.

6. Then ye Lord said vnto Kain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance cast downe?

7. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be 

8. Then Kain spake to Habel his brother; when they were in the fielde, Kain rose vp against Habel his brother, and slewe him.

9. And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: 

10. And he said, What hast thou done? the 

11. And now [art] thou cursed 

12. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a 

13. And Cain said unto the LORD, 

14. Behold, thou hast cast me out this day fro the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, and shalbe a vagabond, and a runnagate in the earth, and whosoeuer findeth me, shall slay me.

15. And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, 

16. Then Kain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod towarde the Eastside of Eden.

17. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a

21. And his brothers name was Iubal, who was the father of all that play on the harpe and organes.

22. And Zillah also bare Tubal-kain, who wrought cunningly euery craft of brasse and of yron: and the sister of Tubal-kain was Naamah.

23. And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: 

24. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech 

25. And Adam knewe his wife againe, and she bare a sonne, and she called his name Sheth: for God, saide she, hath appointed me another seede for Habel, because Kain slewe him.

26. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to

2. That the 

3. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always 

4. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of 

5. When the Lorde sawe that the wickednesse of man was great in the earth, and all the imaginations of the thoughtes of his heart were onely euill continually,

6. And it 

7. And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and 

8. But Noah 

9. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a iust and vpright man in his time: and Noah walked with God.

10. And Noah begate three sonnes, Shem, Ham and Iapheth.

11. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with 

12. Then God looked vpon the earth, and beholde, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupt his way vpon the earth.

13. And God said vnto Noah, An ende of all flesh is come before me: for the earth is filled with crueltie through them: and beholde, I wil destroy them with the earth.

14. Make thee an Arke of pine trees: thou shalt make cabines in the Arke, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

15. And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the Arke shalbe three hundreth cubites, the breadth of it fiftie cubites, and the height of it thirtie cubites.

16. A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; [with] 

17. And I, beholde, I will bring a flood of waters vpon the earth to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life vnder the heauen: all that is in the earth shall perish.

18. But with thee will I 

19. And of euery liuing thing, of all flesh two of euery sort shalt thou cause to come into the Arke, to keepe them aliue with thee: they shalbe male and female.

20. Of the foules, after their kinde, and of the cattell after their kind, of euery creeping thing of the earth after his kinde, two of euery sort shall come vnto thee, that thou mayest keepe them aliue.

21. And take thou with thee of all meate that is eaten: and thou shalt gather it to thee, that it may be meate for thee and for them.

22. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, 

## Genesis 7

1. And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen 

2. Of every 

3. Of the foules also of the heauen by seuens, male and female, to keepe seede aliue vpon the whole earth.

4. For seuen dayes hence I will cause it raine vpon the earth fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes, and all the substance that I haue made, will I destroy from off the earth.

5. Noah therefore did according vnto all that the Lord commanded him.

6. And Noah was sixe hundreth yeeres olde, when the flood of waters was vpon the earth.

7. So Noah entred and his sonnes, and his wife, & his sonnes wiues with him into the Arke, because of the waters of the flood.

8. Of the cleane beastes, and of the vncleane beastes, and of the foules, and of all that creepeth vpon the earth,

9. There 

10. And so after seuen dayes the waters of the flood were vpon the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the 

12. And the raine was vpon the earth fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes.

13. In the selfe same day entred Noah with Shem, and Ham and Iapheth, the sonnes of Noah, and Noahs wife, and the three wiues of his sonnes with them into the Arke.

14. They and euery beast after his kinde, and all cattell after their kinde, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth after his kinde, and euery foule after his kinde, euen euery bird of euery fether.

15. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two 

16. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD 

17. Then ye flood was fourtie dayes vpon the earth, and the waters were increased, and bare vp the Arke, which was lift vp aboue the earth.

18. The waters also waxed strong, and were increased exceedingly vpon the earth, and the Arke went vpon the waters.

19. The waters preuailed so exceedingly vpon the earth, that all the high mountaines, that are vnder the whole heauen, were couered.

20. Fifteene cubites vpwarde did the waters preuaile, when the mountaines were couered.

21. Then all flesh perished that moued vpon the earth, both foule and cattell and beast, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth, and euery man.

22. Euery thing in whose nostrels the spirit of life did breathe, whatsoeuer they were in the drie land, they died.

23. And every living substance was destroyed 

24. And the waters preuailed vpon the earth an hundreth and fiftie dayes.

## Genesis 8

1. And God 

2. The fountaines also of the deepe and the windowes of heauen were stopped and the raine from heauen was restrained,

3. And the waters returned from aboue the earth, going and returning: and after the ende of the hundreth and fiftieth day the waters abated.

4. And the ark rested in the 

5. And the waters decreased continually until the 

6. So after fourtie dayes, Noah opened the windowe of the Arke, which he had made,

7. And sent forth a rauen, which went out going forth and returning, vntill the waters were dried vp vpon the earth.

8. Againe he sent a doue from him, that he might see if the waters were diminished from off the earth.

9. But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he 

10. And he abode yet other seuen dayes, and againe he sent forth the doue out of the Arke.

11. And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an 

12. Notwithstanding he wayted yet other seuen dayes, and sent forth the doue, which returned not againe vnto him any more.

13. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the 

14. And in the second moneth, in the seuen & twentieth day of the moneth was the earth drie.

15. Then God spake to Noah, saying,

16. 
          

17. Bring forth with thee euery beast that is with thee, of all flesh, both foule and cattell, and euery thing that creepeth and moueth vpon the earth, that they may breede abundantly in ye earth, and bring forth fruite & increase vpon ye earth.

18. So Noah came forth, and his sonnes, and his wife, and his sonnes wiues with him.

19. Euery beast, euery creeping thing, and euery foule, all that moueth vpon the earth after their kindes went out of the Arke.

20. And Noah 

21. And the LORD smelled a

6. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, 

7. But bring ye forth fruite & multiplie: grow plentifully in the earth, and increase therein.

8. God spake also to Noah & to his sonnes with him, saying,

9. And I, behold, I establish my 

10. And with euery liuing creature that is with you, with the foule, with the cattell, and with euery beast of the earth with you, from all that goe out of the Arke, vnto euery beast of the earth.

11. And my couenant will I establish with you, that from henceforth all flesh shall not be rooted out by ye waters of the flood, neither shall there be a flood to destroy the earth any more.

12. Then God saide, This is the token of the couenant which I make betweene me and you, and betweene euery liuing thing, that is with you vnto perpetuall generations.

13. I do set my 

14. And when I shall couer the earth with a cloud, and the bowe shall be seene in the cloude,

15. And I will remember my 

16. Therefore the bowe shalbe in the cloude, that I may see it, and remember the euerlasting couenant betweene God, and euery liuing thing in all flesh that is vpon the earth.

17. And God said unto Noah, 

18. Nowe the sonnes of Noah going foorth of the Arke, were Shem and Ham and Iapheth; Ham is the father of Canaan.

19. These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth 

20. Noah also began to be an husband man and planted a vineyard.

21. And he drank of the wine, and was 

22. And Ham, the father of 

23. Then tooke Shem & Iapheth a garment, and put it vpon both their shoulders, and went backwarde, and couered the nakednesse of their father with their faces backwarde: so they sawe not their fathers nakednesse.

24. Then Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonger sonne had done vnto him,

25. And he said, 

26. He said moreouer, blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and let Canaan be his seruant.

27. God shall 

28. And Noah liued after the flood three hundreth and fiftie yeeres.

29. So all the dayes of Noah were nine hundreth and fiftie yeeres: and he died.

9. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even 

10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of 

11. Out of that land came Asshur, and builded Niniueh, and the citie Rehoboth, and Calah:

12. Resen also betweene Niniueh and Calah: this is a great citie.

19. Then the border of the Canaanites was from Zidon, as thou commest to Gerar vntil Azzah, and as thou goest vnto Sodom, & Gomorah, and Admah, and Zeboijm, euen vnto Lasha.

20. These are the sonnes of Ham according to their families, according to their tongues in their countries and in their nations.

32. These are the families of the sonnes of Noah, after their generations among their people: and out of these were the nations diuided in the earth after the flood.

## Genesis 11

1. Then the whole earth was of one language and one speache.

2. And it came to pass, 

3. And they said one to another, Come, let vs make bricke, and burne it in the fire. So they had bricke for stone, and slyme had they in steade of morter.

4. And they said, Go to, let us 

5. And the LORD 

6. And the LORD said, 

7. Go to, 

8. So ye Lord scattered them from thence vpon all the earth, & they left off to build the citie.

9. Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because the Lorde did there confounde the language of all the earth: from thence then did the Lord scatter them vpon all the earth.

10. These [are] the generations 

11. And Shem liued, after he begate Arpachshad, fiue hundreth yeeres, and begate sonnes and daughters.

25. Be it farre fro thee from doing this thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be euen as the wicked, be it farre from thee. shall not the Iudge of all the worlde doe right?

7. Then spake Izhak vnto Abraham his father, and said, My father; he answered, Here am I, my sonne; he said, Behold the fire & the wood, but where is the lambe for ye burnt offring?

8. And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a

10. And Abraham stretching forth his hand, tooke the knife to kill his sonne.

11. But the Angel of the Lord called vnto him from heauen, saying, Abraham, Abraham; he answered, Here am I.

12. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I 

13. And Abraham lifting vp his eyes, looked: and behold, there was a ramme behind him caught by the hornes in a bush. then Abraham went and tooke the ramme, and offered him vp for a burnt offering in the steade of his sonne.

18. And in thy seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voyce.

19. Then turned Abraham againe vnto his seruants, and they rose vp & went together to Beer-sheba: and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.

20. And after these things one tolde Abraham, saying, Beholde Milcah, she hath also borne children vnto thy brother Nahor:

21. To wit, Vz his eldest sonne, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,

3. And Abraham 

4. I am a stranger, & a forreiner among you, giue me a possession of buriall with you, that I may burie my dead out of my sight.

5. Then the Hittites answered Abraham, saying vnto him,

8. And he communed with them, saying, If it be your minde, that I shall bury my dead out of my sight, heare me, and intreate for me to Ephron the sonne of Zohar,

9. That he would giue me ye caue of Machpelah, which he hath in the ende of his field: that he would giue it me for as much money as it is worth, for a possession to bury in among you.

10. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, [even] of all that 

11. No, my Lorde, heare me: the fielde giue I thee, and the caue, that therein is, I giue it thee: euen in the presence of the sonnes of my people giue I it thee, to bury thy dead.

12. And Abraham 

13. And spake vnto Ephron in the audience of the people of the countrey, saying, Seeing thou wilt giue it, I pray thee, heare me, I will giue the price of the fielde: receiue it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

14. Ephron then answered Abraham, saying vnto him,

15. My lord, hearken unto me: the land [is worth] four hundred 

16. So Abraham hearkened vnto Ephron, and Abraham weyed to Ephron the siluer, which he had named, in the audience of the Hittites, euen foure hundreth siluer shekels of currant money among marchants.

17. So the fielde of Ephron which was in Machpelah, and ouer against Mamre, euen the field and the caue that was therein, and all the trees that were in the fielde, which were in all the borders round about, was made sure

18. Vnto Abraham for a possession, in ye sight of the Hittites, euen of all that went in at the gates of his citie.

19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the caue of the fielde of Machpelah ouer against Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

20. And the field, and the cave that [is] therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace 

## Genesis 24

1. Nowe Abraham was olde, and striken in yeeres, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.

2. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had,

4. But thou shalt go unto my 

5. And the seruant saide to him, What if the woman will not come with me to this land? Shall I bring thy sonne againe vnto the lande from whence thou camest?

6. And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son 

7. The Lord God of heauen, who tooke me from my fathers house, and from the land where I was borne, and that spake vnto me, and that sware vnto me, saying, Vnto thy seede wil I giue this land, he shall send his Angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife vnto my sonne fro thence.

8. Neuertheles if the woman wil not followe thee, then shalt thou bee discharged of this mine othe: onely bring not my sonne thither againe.

9. Then the seruant put his hand vnder the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him for this matter.

10. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master [were] in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the 

11. And he made his camels to lye downe without the citie by a well of water, at euentide about the time that the women come out to draw water.

12. And he said, O 

13. Lo, I stand by the well of water, whiles the mens daughters of this citie come out to drawe water.

14. 
          

15. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, 

16. And the damsel [was] very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she 

17. Then the seruant ranne to meete her, and said, Let me drinke, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher.

18. And she said, Drinke sir: and she hasted, and let downe her pitcher vpon her hand and gaue him drinke.

19. And when she had giuen him drinke, she said, I will drawe water for thy camels also vntill they haue drunken inough.

20. And she powred out her pitcher into the trough speedily; and ranne againe vnto the well to drawe water, and she drewe for all his camels.

21. So the man wondred at her, and helde his peace, to knowe whether the Lord had made his iourney prosperous or not.

22. And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden 

23. And he said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee, Is there roume in thy fathers house for vs to lodge in?

24. Then she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the sonne of Milcah whom she bare vnto Nahor.

25. Moreouer she said vnto him, We haue litter also & prouender ynough, & roume to lodge in.

26. And the man bowed himselfe and worshipped the Lord,

27. And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy 

28. And the maide ranne and tolde them of her mothers house according to these wordes.

29. Now Rebekah had a brother called Laban, and Laban ranne vnto the man to the well.

30. And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, 

31. And he saide, Come in thou blessed of the Lord: wherefore standest thou without, seeing I haue prepared the house, & roume for ye camels?

32. And the man came into the house: and 

33. And there was set [meat] before him to eat: but he said, I

37. And my master made me swear, saying, 

38. But thou shalt go unto my 

39. Then I saide vnto my master, What if the woman will not followe me?

40. Who answered me, The Lord, before who I walke, will send his Angel with thee, and prosper thy iourney, and thou shalt take a wife for my sonne of my kinred and my fathers house.

41. Then shalt thou be clear from [this] 

42. So I came this day to the well, and said, O Lorde, the God of my master Abraham, if thou nowe prosper my iourney which I goe,

43. Behold, I stand by the wel of water: when a virgine commeth forth to drawe water, and I say to her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water of thy pitcher to drinke,

44. And she say to me, Drinke thou, and I will also drawe for thy camels, let her be ye wife, which the Lord hath prepared for my masters sonne.

45. And before I had done speaking in mine 

46. And she made haste, and tooke downe her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drinke, and I will giue thy camels drinke also. So I dranke, and she gaue the camels drinke also.

47. Then I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she answered, The daughter of Bethuel Nahors sonne, whom Milcah bare vnto him. Then I put the abillement vpon her face, and the bracelets vpon her hands:

48. 
          

49. And now if ye will deal 

50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, 

51. Beholde, Rebehak is before thee, take her and goe, that she may be thy masters sonnes wife, euen as the Lord hath said.

52. And when Abrahams seruant heard their wordes, he bowed himselfe toward the earth vnto the Lord.

53. Then the seruant tooke foorth iewels of siluer, and iewels of golde, and raiment, and gaue to Rebekah: also vnto her brother and to her mother he gaue gifts.

54. Afterward they did eate & drinke, both he, and the men that were with him, and taried all night; when they rose vp in the morning, he said, Let me depart vnto my master.

55. Then her brother and her mother answered, Let the maide abide with vs, at the least ten dayes: then shall she goe.

56. But he said vnto them, Hinder you me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my iourney: send me away, that I may goe to my master.

57. And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at

59. So they let Rebekah their sister goe, & her nourse, with Abrahams seruant and his men.

60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou [art] our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the 

61. Then Rebekah arose, & her maydes, and rode vpon the camels, and followed the man; the seruant tooke Rebekah, and departed.

62. Nowe Izhak came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi, (for he dwelt in the South countrey)

63. And Isaac went out to 

64. Also Rebekah lift vp her eyes, & when she saw Izhak, she lighted downe from the camel.

65. (For shee had sayde to the seruant, Who is yonder man, that commeth in the fielde to meete vs? and the seruant had said, It is my master) So she tooke a vaile, and couered her.

66. And the seruant tolde Izhak all things, that he had done.

67. Afterward Izhak brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he tooke Rebekah, and she was his wife, and he loued her: So Izhak was comforted after his mothers death.

4. Also the sonnes of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, & Eldaah all these were the sonnes of Keturah.

8. Then Abraham yeelded the spirit, and died in a good age, an olde man, and of great yeeres, & was gathered to his people.

9. And his sonnes, Izhak and Ishmael buryed him in the caue of Machpelah, in the fielde of Ephron sonne of Zohar the Hittite, before Mamre.

10. Which fielde Abraham bought of the Hittites, where Abraham was buryed with Sarah his wife.

11. And after the death of Abraham God blessed Izhak his sonne, and Izhak dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.

12. Nowe these are the generations of Ishmael Abrahams sonne, whome Hagar the Egyptian Sarahs handmayde bare vnto Abraham.

13. And these are the names of the sonnes of Ishmael, name by name, according to their kinreds; the eldest sonne of Ishmael was Nebaioth, then Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15. Hadar, and Tema, Ietur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These are the sonnes of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their townes and by their castles: to wit, twelue princes of their nations.

17. And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his 

18. And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: [and] he died 

19. Likewise these are the generations of Izhak Abrahams sonne Abraham begate Izhak,

20. And Izhak was fourtie yeere olde, when he tooke Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramite of Padan Aram, and sister to Laban the Aramite.

21. And Izhak prayed vuto the Lorde for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiued,

22. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why [am] I 

23. And the Lord sayd to her, Two nations are in thy wombe, and two maner of people shalbe diuided out of thy bowels, and the one people shall be mightier then the other, and the elder shall serue the yonger.

24. Therefore when her time of deliuerance was fulfilled, behold, twinnes were in her wombe.

25. So he that came out first was red, and he was all ouer as a rough garment, and they called his name Esau.

26. And afterward came his brother out, and his hande helde Esau by the heele: therefore his name was called Iaakob. Nowe Izhak was threescore yeere olde when Rebekah bare them.

27. And the boyes grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, and liued in the fields: but Iaakob was a plaine man, and dwelt in tentes.

28. And Izhak loued Esau, for venison was his meate, but Rebekah loued Iaakob.

29. Nowe Iaakob sod pottage, and Esau came from the fielde and was wearie.

30. Then Esau sayd to Iaakob, Let me eate, I pray thee, of that pottage so red, for I am wearie. Therefore was his name called Edom.

31. And Iaakob sayd, Sell me euen nowe thy birthright.

32. And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what 

33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he

7. And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: 

8. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] 

9. Then Abimelech called Izhak, and sayde, Loe, shee is of a suertie thy wife, and why saydest thou, She is my sister? To whom Izhak answered, Because I thought this, It may be that I shall dye for her.

10. And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought 

11. Then Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man, or his wife, shal die the death.

12. Afterwarde Izhak sowed in that lande, and founde in the same yeere an hundreth folde by estimation: and so the Lord blessed him.

13. And the man waxed mightie, and stil increased, till he was exceeding great,

14. For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines 

15. In so much that the Philistims stopped and filled vp with earth all the welles, which his fathers seruantes digged in his father Abrahams time.

16. Then Abimelech sayde vnto Izhak, Get thee from vs, for thou art mightier then wee a great deale.

17. And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the 

18. And Izhak returning, digged the welles of water, which they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father: for the Philistims had stopped them after the death of Abraham, and hee gaue them the same names, which his father gaue them.

19. Izhaks seruantes then digged in the valley, and found there a well of liuing water.

20. But the herdmen of Gerar did striue with Izhaks herdmen, saying, The water is ours: therefore called he the name of the wel Esek, because they were at strife with him.

21. Afterwarde they digged another well, and stroue for that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah.

22. Then he remoued thence, and digged an other well, for the which they stroue not: therefore called hee the name of it Rehoboth, and sayde, Because the Lorde hath nowe made vs roome, we shall increase vpon the earth.

23. So he went vp thence to Beer-sheba.

24. And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God 

25. And he builded an 

26. Then came Abimelech to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friendes, and Phichol the captaine of his armie.

27. To whom Izhak sayd, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate mee and haue put mee away from you?

28. Who answered, Wee sawe certainely that the Lorde was with thee, and wee thought thus, Let there be nowe an othe betweene vs, euen betweene vs and thee, and let vs make a couenant with thee.

29. 
          

30. Then hee made them a feast, and they dyd eate and drinke.

31. And they rose vp betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: then Izhak let them go, and they departed from him in peace.

32. And that same day Izhaks seruantes came and tolde him of a well, which they had digged, and said vnto him, We haue found water.

33. So hee called it Shibah: therefore the name of the citie is called Beer-sheba vnto this day.

34. Nowe when Esau was fourtie yeere olde, he tooke to wife Iudith, the daughter of Beeri an Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon an Hittite also.

35. And they were a griefe of minde to Izhak and to Rebekah.

## Genesis 27

1. And when Izhak was olde, and his eyes were dimme (so that he coulde not see) he called Esau his eldest sonne, and sayde vnto him, My sonne; he answered him, I am here.

2. Then he sayd, Beholde, I am nowe olde, and knowe not the day of my death:

3. Wherefore nowe, I pray thee take thine instrumentes, thy quiuer and thy bowe, and get thee to the fielde, that thou mayest take mee some venison.

4. And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me, that I may eat; that my

6. Then Rebekah spake vnto Iaakob her sonne, saying, Beholde, I haue heard thy father talking with Esau thy brother, saying,

7. Bring mee venision, and make mee sauourie meate, that I may eate and blesse thee before the Lord, afore my death.

8. Nowe therefore, my sonne, heare my voyce in that which I command thee.

9. 
          

10. Then shalt thou bring it to thy father, and he shal eate, to the intent that he may blesse thee before his death.

11. But Iaakob sayde to Rebekah his mother, Beholde, Esau my brother is rough, and I am smoothe.

12. My father may possibly feele me, and I shal seem to him to be a mocker: so shall I bring a curse vpon me, and not a blessing.

13. And his mother said unto him, 

14. So he went and set them, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made pleasant meat, such as his father loued.

15. And Rebekah tooke faire clothes of her elder sonne Esau, which were in her house, and clothed Iaakob her yonger sonne:

16. And she couered his hands and the smoothe of his necke with the skinnes of the kiddes of the goates.

17. Afterward she put the pleasant meate and bread, which she had prepared, in the hand of her sonne Iaakob.

18. And when he came to his father, he sayd, My father. Who answered, I am here: who art thou, my sonne?

19. And Jacob said unto his father, 

20. Then Izhak said vnto his sonne, Howe hast thou founde it so quickly my sonne? Who sayde, Because the Lorde thy God brought it to mine hande.

21. Againe sayde Izhak vnto Iaakob, Come neere nowe, that I may feele thee, my sonne, whether thou be that my sonne Esau or not.

22. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The

24. Againe he sayd, Art thou that my sonne Esau? Who answered, Yea.

25. Then said he, Bring it me hither, and I will eate of my sonnes venison, that my soule may blesse thee; he brought it to him, and he ate: also he brought him wine, and he dranke.

26. Afterward his father Izhak sayd vnto him, Come neere nowe, and kisse me, my sonne.

27. And hee came neere and kissed him. Then he smelled the sauour of his garmentes, and blessed him, and sayde, Behold, the smell of my sonne is as the smell of a fielde, which the Lorde hath blessed.

28. God giue thee therefore of the dewe of heauen, and the fatnesse of the earth, and plentie of wheate and wine.

29. Let people bee thy seruantes, and nations bowe vnto thee: be Lorde ouer thy brethren, and let thy mothers children honour thee. Cursed be he that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

30. And when Izhak had made an ende of blessing Iaakob, and Iaakob was scarce gone out from the presence of Izhak his father, then came Esau his brother from his hunting,

31. And hee also prepared sauourie meate and brought it to his father, and sayd vnto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sonnes venison, that thy soule may blesse me.

32. But his father Izhak sayde vnto him, Who art thou? And he answered, I am thy sonne, euen thy first borne Esau.

33. And Isaac 

34. When Esau heard the wordes of his father, he cryed out with a great crye and bitter, out of measure, and sayde vnto his father, Blesse me, euen me also, my father.

35. Who answered, Thy brother came with subtiltie, and hath taken away thy blessing.

36. And he said, Is not he rightly named 

37. And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him 

38. Then Esau sayde vnto his father, Hast thou but one blessing my father? blesse mee, euen me also, my father: and Esau lifted vp his voyce, and wept.

39. Then Izhak his father answered, and sayde vnto him, Behold, the fatnesse of the earth shal be thy dwelling place, and thou shalt haue of the dewe of heauen from aboue.

40. And 

41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; 

42. And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, 

43. Now therefore my sonne, heare my voyce, arise, & flee thou to Haran to my brother Laban,

44. And tarie with him a while vntill thy brothers fiercenesse be swaged,

1. Then Jacob 

2. And he looked, and behold a well in the field, 

3. And thither were all the flockes gathered, & they rolled the stone from the welles mouth, and watered the sheepe, and put the stone againe vpon the welles mouth in his place.

4. And Jacob said unto them, My 

5. Then he sayd vnto them, Know ye Laban the sonne of Nahor? Who said, We know him.

6. And he said unto them, 

7. Then he sayd, Lo, it is yet hie day, neither is it time that the cattell shoulde be gathered together: water ye the sheepe and go feede them.

8. But they sayde, We may not vntill all the flocks be brought together, and till men rolle the stone from the welles mouth, that we may water the sheepe.

9. While he talked with them, Rahel also came with her fathers sheepe, for she kept them.

10. And assoone as Iaakob saw Rahel ye daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheepe of Laban his mothers brother, then came Iaakob neere, & rolled the stone fro the welles mouth, & watered ye flocke of Laban his mothers brother.

11. And Iaakob kissed Rahel, and lift vp his voyce and wept.

12. (For Iaakob tolde Rahel, that he was her fathers brother, & that he was Rebekahs sonne) then she ranne and tolde her father.

13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban 

14. And Laban said to him, Surely thou [art] my 

15. For Laban sayde vnto Iaakob, Though thou be my brother, shouldest thou therfore serue me for nought? tell me, what shalbe thy wages?

16. Now Laban had two daughters, the elder called Leah, and the yonger called Rahel.

17. And Leah was tender eyed, but Rahel was beautifull and faire.

18. And Iaakob loued Rahel, and sayde, I will serue thee seuen yeeres for Rahel thy yonger daughter.

19. Then Laban answered, It is better that I giue her thee, then that I should giue her to another man: abide with me.

20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him [but] a 

21. Then Iaakob sayde to Laban, Giue me my wife, that I may goe in to her: for my terme is ended.

22. Wherefore Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

23. And 

24. And Laban gaue his mayde Zilpah to his daughter Leah, to be her seruant.

25. But when the morning was come, behold, it was Leah. Then sayde he to Laban, Wherefore hast thou done thus to mee? did not I serue thee for Rahel? wherfore then hast thou beguiled me?

26. And Laban said, 

27. Fulfill seuen yeeres for her, and we wil also giue thee this for the seruice, which thou shalt serue me yet seuen yeeres more.

28. Then Iaakob did so, and fulfilled her seuen yeeres, so he gaue him Rahel his daughter to be his wife.

29. Laban also gaue to Rahel his daughter Bilhah his mayde to be her seruant.

30. So entred he in to Rahel also, and loued also Rahel more then Leah, and serued him yet seuen yeeres mo.

31. And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, he 

32. And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the 

33. And she conceiued againe & bare a sonne, and sayde, Because the Lord heard that I was hated, he hath therefore giuen me this sonne also, & she called his name Simeon.

34. And she conceiued againe & bare a sonne, and said, Now at this time wil my husband keepe mee company, because I haue borne him three sonnes: therefore was his name called Leui.

35. Moreouer shee conceiued againe and bare a sonne, saying, Nowe will I prayse the Lorde: therefore shee called his name Iudah, and left bearing.

## Genesis 30

1. And when Rahel saw that she bare Iaakob no children, Rahel enuied her sister, and said vnto Iaakob, Giue me children, or els I dye.

2. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, [Am] I in 

3. And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my 

4. Then shee gaue him Bilhah her mayde to wife, and Iaakob went in to her.

5. So Bilhah conceiued and bare Iaakob a sonne.

6. Then said Rahel, God hath giuen sentence on my side, and hath also heard my voyce, and hath giuen mee a sonne: therefore called shee his name, Dan.

7. And Bilhah Rahels maide coceiued againe, and bare Iaakob the second sonne.

8. And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, 

9. And when Leah saw that she had left bearing, shee tooke Zilpah her mayde, and gaue her Iaakob to wife.

10. And Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iaakob a sonne.

11. And Leah said, 

12. Againe Zilpah Leahs mayde bare Iaakob another sonne.

13. Then sayde Leah, Ah, blessed am I, for the daughters will blesse me; she called his name, Asher.

14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found 

15. But shee answered her, Is it a small matter for thee to take mine husband, except thou take my sonnes mandrakes also? Then sayde Rahel, Therefore he shall sleepe with thee this night for thy sonnes mandrakes.

16. And Iaakob came from the fielde in the euening, and Leah went out to meete him, and sayde, Come in to mee, for I haue bought and payed for thee with my sonnes mandrakes: and he slept with her that night.

17. And God heard Leah and shee conceiued, and bare vnto Iaakob the fift sonne.

18. And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my 

19. After, Leah conceiued againe, & bare Iaakob the sixt sonne.

20. Then Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowrie: nowe will mine husbande dwell with me, because I haue borne him sixe sonnes: & she called his name Zebulun.

21. After that, shee bare a daughter, and shee called her name Dinah.

22. And God remembred Rahel, and God heard her, and opened her wombe.

23. And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my 

24. And shee called his name Ioseph, saying, The Lord wil giue me yet another sonne.

25. And assoone as Rahel had borne Ioseph, Iaakob said to Laban, Sende me away that I may go vnto my place and to my countrey.

26. Giue me my wiues and my children, for whom I haue serued thee, and let me go: for thou knowest what seruice I haue done thee.

27. To whom Laban answered, If I haue nowe found fauour in thy sight tarie: I haue perceiued that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.

28. Also he said, Appoynt vnto me thy wages, and I will giue it thee.

29. But he sayd vnto him, Thou knowest, what seruice I haue done thee, and in what taking thy cattell hath bene vnder me.

30. For [it was] little which thou hadst before I [came], and it is [now] increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall 

31. Then he saide, What shal I giue thee? And Iaakob answered, Thou shalt giue mee nothing at all: if thou wilt doe this thing for mee, I will returne, feede, and keepe thy sheepe.

32. I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: 

33. So shall my 

34. Then Laban sayde, Goe to, woulde God it might be according to thy saying.

35. Therefore he tooke out the same day the hee goates that were partie coloured and with great spots, and all the shee goates with litle and great spots, and all that had white in them, and all the blacke among the sheepe, and put them in the keeping of his sonnes.

36. And hee set three dayes iourney betweene himselfe and Iaakob; Iaakob kept the rest of Labans sheepe.

37. And Jacob 

38. Then he put the rods, which he had pilled, in the gutters and watering troughes, when the sheepe came to drink, before the sheepe. (for they were in heate, when they came to drinke)

39. And the sheepe were in heate before the rods, and afterward brought forth yong of partie colour, and with small and great spots.

40. And Iaakob parted these lambes, and turned the faces of the flocke towardes these lambes partie coloured and all maner of blacke, among the sheepe of Laban: so hee put his owne flockes by themselues, and put them not with Labans flocke.

41. And it came to pass, whensoever the 

42. But when the sheepe were feeble, hee put them not in: and so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger Iaakobs.

43. So the man encreased exceedingly, and had many flockes, and maide seruantes, and men seruants, and camels and asses.

## Genesis 31

1. And he heard the 

2. Also Iaakob beheld the countenance of Laban, that it was not towards him as in times past:

3. And the Lorde had said vnto Iaakob, Turne againe into the lande of thy fathers, and to thy kinred, and I wilbe with thee.

4. Therefore Iaakob sent and called Rahel and Leah to the fielde vnto his flocke.

5. And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it [is] not toward me as before; but the 

6. And yee knowe that I haue serued your father with all my might.

7. But your father hath deceiued me, & changed my wages tenne times: but God suffred him not to hurt me.

8. If he thus sayd, The spotted shall be thy wages, then all the sheepe bare spotted: and if he sayd thus, the party coloured shalbe thy rewarde, then bare all the sheepe particoloured.

9. Thus 

10. For in ramming time I lifted vp mine eyes and saw in a dreame, & beholde, ye hee goates leaped vpon the shee goates, that were partie coloured with litle and great spots spotted.

11. And the Angel of God sayde to mee in a dreame, Iaakob; I answered, Lo, I am here.

12. And he sayde, Lift vp nowe thine eyes, and see all the hee goates leaping vpon ye shee goates that are partie coloured, spotted with litle and great spots: for I haue seene all that Laban doeth vnto thee.

13. 
          

14. Then answered Rahel and Leah, and sayde vnto him, Haue wee any more porcion and inheritance in our fathers house?

15. Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath 

16. Therefore all the riches, which God hath taken from our father, is ours and our childrens: nowe then whatsoeuer God hath saide vnto thee, doe it.

17. Then Iaakob rose vp, and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels.

18. And he caried away all his flockes, & al his substance which he had gotten, to wit, his riches, which he had gotten in Padan Aram, to goe to Izhak his father vnto the land of Canaan.

19. And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the 

20. Thus Iaakob stole away ye heart of Laban the Aramite: for he told him not that he fled.

21. So fled he with all that he had, and he rose vp, and passed the riuer, and set his face towarde mount Gilead.

22. And the third day after was it told Laban, that Iaakob fled.

23. Then he tooke his brethren with him, & followed after him seuen dayes iourney, and ouertooke him at mount Gilead.

24. And God came to Laban the Aramite in a dreame by night, and sayde vnto him, Take heede that thou speake not to Iaakob ought saue good.

25. Then Laban ouertooke Iaakob, & Iaakob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban also with his brethren pitched vpon mount Gilead.

26. Then Laban sayde to Iaakob, What hast thou done? thou hast euen stolen away mine heart and caried away my daughters as though they had bene taken captiues with the sworde.

27. Wherfore diddest thou flie so secretly and steale away from me, and diddest not tel me, that I might haue sent thee foorth with mirth & with songs, with timbrel and with harpe?

28. But thou hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters: nowe thou hast done foolishly in doing so.

29. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the 

30. Nowe though thou wentest thy way, because thou greatly longedst after thy fathers house, yet wherefore hast thou stollen my gods?

31. Then Iaakob answered, and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, & thought that thou wouldest haue taken thy daughters from me.

32. But with whome thou findest thy gods, let him not liue. Search thou before our brethre what I haue of thine, & take it to thee, (but Iaakob wist not that Rahel had stolen them)

33. Then came Laban into Iaakobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maides tentes, but founde them not. So hee went out of Leahs tent, and entred into Rahels tent.

34. (Nowe Rahel had taken the idoles, & put them in the camels litter and sate downe vpon them) and Laban searched al the tent, but found them not.

35. Then said she to her father, My Lord, be not angrie that I cannot rise vp before thee: for the custome of women is vpo me: so he searched, but found not the idoles.

36. The Iaakob was wroth, and chode with Laban: Iaakob also answered and sayd to Laban, What haue I trespassed? what haue I offended, that thou hast pursued after me?

37. Seeing thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou foud of all thine houshold stuffe? put it here before my brethren & thy brethren, that they may iudge betweene vs both.

38. This twenty yere I haue bin with thee: thine ewes & thy goates haue not cast their yong, and the rammes of thy flocke haue I not eaten.

39. Whatsoeuer was torne of beasts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my selfe: of mine hand diddest thou require it, were it stollen by day or stollen by night.

40. I was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes.

41. Thus haue I bene twentie yeere in thine house, and serued thee fourteene yeeres for thy two daughters, and sixe yeeres for thy sheepe, and thou hast changed my wages tenne times.

42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the 

43. Then Laban answered, and saide vnto Iaakob, These daughters are my daughters, & these sonnes are my sonnes, and these sheepe are my sheepe, and all that thou seest, is mine, and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or to their sonnes which they haue borne?

44. Now therefore 

45. Then tooke Iaakob a stone, and set it vp as a pillar:

46. And Iaakob sayde vnto his brethren, Gather stones: who brought stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape.

47. And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it 

48. For Laban sayd, This heape is witnesse betweene me and thee this day: therefore he called the name of it Galeed.

49. And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD 

50. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take [other] 

51. Moreouer Laban sayd to Iaakob, Beholde this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue set betweene me and thee,

52. This heape shall be witnesse, and the pillar shall be witnesse, that I will not come ouer this heape to thee, and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape and this pillar vnto me for euill.

53. The God of Abraham, and the God of 

54. Then Iaakob did offer a sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate bread; they did eate bread, and taried all night in the mount.

55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and 

## Genesis 32

1. Nowe Iaakob went forth on his iourney and the Angels of God met him.

2. And when Jacob saw them, he said, 

3. Then Iaakob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, vnto the land of Seir into the countrey of Edom:

4. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my 

5. I haue beeues also and Asses, sheepe, & men seruantes, and women seruantes, and haue sent to shew my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

6. So ye messengers came againe to Iaakob, saying, We came vnto thy brother Esau, and hee also commeth against thee and foure hundreth men with him.

7. Then Jacob was 

8. For he said, If Esau come to ye one copanie and smite it, the other companie shall escape.

9. Moreouer Iaakob said, O God of my father Abraham, & God of my father Izhak: Lord, which saydest vnto me, Returne vnto thy coutrey and to thy kinred, and I will do thee good,

10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my 

11. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, [and] the 

12. For thou saydest; I will surely doe thee good, and make thy seede as the sande of the sea, which can not be nombred for multitude.

13. And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a 

14. Two hundreth shee goates & twenty hee goates, two hundreth ewes & twentie rammes:

15. Thirtie mylche camels with their coltes, fourtie kine, and ten bullockes, twentie she asses and ten foles.

16. So he deliuered them into the hande of his seruants, euery droue by themselues, and saide vnto his seruants, Passe before me, & put a space betweene droue and droue.

17. And he commanded the formost, saying, If Esau my brother meete thee, and aske thee, saying, Whose seruant art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?

18. Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs.

19. So likewise commaunded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him.

20. And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I 

21. So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie.

22. And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok.

23. And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had.

24. And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a 

25. And when he saw that he 

26. And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me.

27. Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob.

28. And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou 

29. Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name; he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? & he blessed him there

30. And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued.

31. And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he 

32. Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh.

## Genesis 33

1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he 

2. And he put the maides, and their children formost, and Leah, and her children after, and Rahel, and Ioseph hindermost.

3. And he passed over before them, and 

4. Then Esau ranne to meete him, and embraced him, and fell on his necke, and kissed him, & they wept.

5. And he lift vp his eyes, and sawe the women, and the children, and saide, Who are these with thee? And he answered, They are ye childre whome God of his grace hath giuen thy seruant.

6. Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they 

7. Leah also with her children came nere and made obeysance: and after Ioseph & Rahel drew neere, and did reuerence.

8. Then he said, What meanest thou by all this droue, which I met? Who answered, I haue sent it, that I may finde fauour in the sight of my lorde:

9. And Esau said, I haue ynough, my brother: keepe that thou hast to thy selfe.

10. And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore 

11. I pray thee take my blessing, that is brought thee: for God hath had mercie on me, and therefore I haue all things: so he compelled him, and he tooke it.

12. And he saide, Let vs take our iourney and go, and I will goe before thee.

13. Then he answered him, My lord knoweth, that the children are tender, & the ewes & kine with yong vnder mine hande: and if they should ouerdriue them one day, all the flocke would die.

14. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until 

15. Then Esau said, I will leaue then some of my folke with thee; he answered, what needeth this? let me finde grace in the sight of my lorde.

16. So Esau returned, and went his way that same day vnto Seir.

17. And Iaakob went forwarde towarde Succoth, and built him an house, & made boothes for his cattell: therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.

18. Afterward, Iaakob came safe to Sheche a citie, which is in the lande of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram, and pitched before the citie.

19. And there he bought a parcell of ground, where hee pitched his tent, at the hande of the sonnes of Hamor Shechems father, for an hundreth pieces of money.

20. And he erected there an altar, and called 

## Genesis 34

1. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, 

2. Whome when Shechem the sonne of Hamor the Hiuite lorde of that countrey sawe, hee tooke her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

3. So his heart claue vnto Dinah the daughter of Iaakob: and he loued the maide, & spake kindely vnto the maide.

4. And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, 

5. (Nowe Iaakob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sonnes were with his cattell in the fielde: therefore Iaakob helde his peace, vntill they were come.)

6. Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out vnto Iaakob to commune with him.

7. And whe the sonnes of Iaakob were come out of the fielde and heard it, it grieued the men, & they were very angry, because he had wrought villenie in Israel, in that he had lyen with Iaakobs daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

8. And Hamor communed with them, saying, the soule of my sonne Shechem longeth for your daughter: giue her him to wife, I pray you.

9. So make affinitie with vs: giue your daughters vnto vs, and take our daughters vnto you,

10. And ye shall dwell with vs, and the lande shalbe before you: dwell, and doe your businesse in it, and haue your possessions therein.

11. Shechem also said vnto her father & vnto her brethren, Let me finde fauour in your eyes, and I will giue whatsoeuer ye shall appoint me.

12. Aske of me abundantly both dowrie and giftes, and I will giue as ye appoint me, so that ye giue me the maide to wife.

13. Then the sonnes of Iaakob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, talking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,

14. And they said unto them, 

15. But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we [be], that every male of you be 

16. Then will we giue our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to vs, and will dwell with you, and be one people.

17. But if ye will not hearken vnto vs to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and depart.

18. Nowe their wordes pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamors sonne.

19. And the yong man deferd not to doe the thing because he loued Iaakobs daughter: he was also the most set by of all his fathers house.

20. And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the 

21. These men [are] 

22. Onely herein will the men consent vnto vs for to dwell with vs, and to be one people, if all the men children among vs be circumcised as they are circumcised.

23. [Shall] not 

24. And vnto Hamor, and Shechem his sonne hearkened all that went out of the gate of his citie: and all the men children were circumcised, euen all that went out of the gate of his citie.

25. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, 

26. They slewe also Hamor and Shechem his sonne with the edge of the sword, & tooke Dinah out of Shechems house, and went their way.

27. Againe the other sonnes of Iaakob came vpon the dead, and spoyled the citie, because they had defiled their sister.

28. They tooke their sheepe & their beeues, and their asses, and whatsoeuer was in the citie, and in the fieldes.

29. Also they caryed away captiue & spoyled all their goods, and all their children and their wiues, and all that was in the houses.

30. Then Iaakob said to Simeon and Leui, Ye haue troubled me, and made me stinke among the inhabitats of the land, aswell the Canaanites, as the Perizzites, and and I being few in nomber, they shall gather theselues together against me, & slay me, and so shall I, and my house be destroied.

31. And they answered, Shoulde hee abuse our sister as a whore?

## Genesis 35

1. And 

2. Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be 

3. For we will rise and goe vp to Beth-el, and I will make an altar there vnto God, which heard me in the day of my tribulation, and was with me in the way which I went.

4. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] 

5. And they journeyed: and the 

6. So came Iaakob to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan: (the same is Beth-el) hee and all the people that was with him.

7. And he built there an altar, and had called the place, The God of Beth-el, because that God appeared vnto him there, when he fled from his brother.

8. Then Deborah Rebekahs nourse dyed, and was buried beneath Beth-el vnder an oke: and he called the name of it Allon Bachuth.

9. Againe God appeared vnto Iaakob, after he came out of Padan Aram, and blessed him.

10. Moreouer God said vnto him, Thy name is Iaakob: thy name shalbe no more called Iaakob, but Israel shalbe thy name: and hee called his name Israel.

11. Againe God said vnto him, I am God all sufficient. growe, and multiplie. a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring of thee, and Kings shall come out of thy loynes.

12. Also I will giue the lande, which I gaue to Abraham and Izhak, vnto thee: and vnto thy seede after thee will I giue that land.

13. And God 

14. And Iaakob set vp a pillar in the place where he talked with him, a pillar of stone, and powred drinke offring thereon: also hee powred oyle thereon.

15. And Iaakob called the name of the place, where God spake with him, Beth-el.

16. And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a 

17. And whe she was in paines of her labour, the midwife saide vnto her, Feare not: for thou shalt haue this sonne also.

18. Then as she was about to yeelde vp the Ghost (for she died) she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Beniamin.

19. Thus died Rahel, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.

20. And Jacob set a

4. So when his brethren sawe that their father loued him more then all his brethren, then they hated him, and could not speake peaceably vnto him.

5. And Joseph 

6. For he saide vnto them, Heare, I pray you, this dreame which I haue dreamed.

7. Beholde nowe, wee were binding sheues in the middes of the field: and loe, my shefe arose and also stoode vpright, and behold, your sheues compassed rounde about, and did reuerence to my shefe.

8. And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they 

9. Againe hee dreamed an other dreame, & tolde it his brethren, and saide, Behold, I haue had one dreame more, and beholde, the Sunne and the Moone & eleuen starres did reuerence to me.

10. And he told [it] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father 

11. And his brethren envied him; but his father

13. And Israel said vnto Ioseph, Doe not thy brethren keepe in Shechem? Come and I will send thee to them.

14. And he answered him, I am here. Then he saide vnto him, Goe now, see whether it bee well with thy brethren, and how the flocks prosper, and bring me word againe. So hee sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15. Then a man found him: for lo, hee was wandring in the fielde, and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

16. And he answered, I seeke my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they keepe sheepe.

17. And the man said, they are departed hece: for I heard them say, Let vs goe vnto Dothan. Then went Ioseph after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.

18. And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they

20. Come now therefore, and let vs slay him, and cast him into some pitte, and wee will say, A wicked beast hath deuoured him: then wee shall see, what will come of his dreames.

21. But when Reuben heard that, he deliuered him out of their handes, and saide, Let vs not kill him.

22. Also Reuben saide vnto them, Shed not blood, but cast him into this pitte that is in the wildernesse, and lay no hande vpon him. Thus he said, that he might deliuer him out of their hand, and restore him to his father againe.

23. Now when Ioseph was come vnto his brethren, they stript Ioseph out of his coate, his particoloured coate that was vpon him.

24. And they took him, and cast

26. Then Iudah said vnto his brethren, What auaileth it, if we slay our brother, though wee keepe his blood secret?

27. Come and let vs sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our handes be vpon him: for he is our brother and our flesh: and his brethren obeyed.

28. Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the

8. And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise 

9. And Onan knewe that the seede should not be his: therefore when he went in vnto his brothers wife, he spilled it on the grounde, least he should giue seede vnto his brother.

10. And it was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, which he did: wherefore he slewe him also.

11. Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, 

12. And in processe of time also the daughter of Shuah Iudahs wife dyed. Then Iudah, when he had left mourning, went vp to his sheepe sherers to Timnah, he, and his neighbour Hirah the Adullamite.

13. And it was tolde Tamar, saying, beholde, thy father in lawe goeth vp to Timnah, to shere his sheepe.

14. Then she put her widowes garments off from her, and couered her with a vaile, and wrapped her selfe, and sate downe in Pethah-enaim, which is by the way to Timnah, because she sawe that Shelah was growen, and she was not giuen vnto him to wife.

15. When Iudah sawe her, he iudged her an whore: for she had couered her face.

9. [There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against

11. Then on a certaine day Ioseph entred into the house, to doe his businesse: and there was no man of the houshold in the house:

18. But assoone as I lift vp my voyce & cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out.

19. Then when his master heard the wordes of his wife, which she tolde him, saying, After this maner did thy seruant to me, his anger was kindled.

1. And after these things, the butler of the King of Egypt and his baker offended their lorde the King of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was angrie against his two officers, against the chiefe butler, and against the chiefe baker.

3. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where 

4. And the chiefe steward gaue Ioseph charge ouer them, and he serued them: and they continued a season in warde.

5. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, 

6. And when Ioseph came in vnto them in the morning, and looked vpon them, beholde, they were sad.

7. And he asked Pharaohs officers, that were with him in his masters warde, saying, Wherefore looke ye so sadly to day?

8. And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, 

9. So the chiefe butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph, and said vnto him, In my dreame, behold, a vine was before me,

10. And in the vine were three branches, and as it budded, her flowre came foorth: and the clusters of grapes waxed ripe.

11. And I had Pharaohs cup in mine hande, and I tooke the grapes, & wrung the into Pharaohs cup, and I gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand.

12. And Joseph said unto him, This 

13. Within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thine head, & restore thee vnto thine office, and thou shalt giue Pharaohs cup into his hand after the olde maner, when thou wast his butler.

14. But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and 

15. For I was stollen away by theft out of the land of the Ebrewes, and here also haue I done nothing, wherefore they should put mee in the dungeon.

16. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also [was] in my dream, and, behold, [I had] three 

17. And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner baken meates for Pharaoh: and the birdes did eate them out of the basket vpon mine head.

18. And Joseph answered and said, 

19. Within three dayes shall Pharaoh take thine head from thee, & shal hang thee on a tree, and the birdes shall eate thy flesh from off thee.

20. And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's 

21. And he restored the chiefe butler vnto his butlershippe, who gaue the cup into Pharaohs hande,

1. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh 

2. And loe, there came out of the riuer seuen goodly kine and fatfleshed, and they fedde in a medowe:

3. And loe, seuen other kine came vp after the out of the riuer, euill fauoured & leane fleshed, and stoode by the other kine vpon the brinke of the riuer.

4. And the euilfauoured and leane fleshed kine did eate vp the seuen welfauoured and fatte kine: so Pharaoh awoke.

5. And he slept and dreamed the 

6. And loe, seuen thinne eares, and blasted with the east winde, sprang vp after them:

7. And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen ranke and full eares. then Pharaoh awaked, and loe, it was a dreame.

8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was 

9. Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I 

10. Pharaoh being angrie with his seruantes, put me in ward in the chiefe stewards house, both me and the chiefe baker.

11. Then we dreamed a dreame in one night, both I, and he: we dreamed eche man according to the interpretation of his dreame.

12. And there was with vs a yong man, an Ebrew, seruant vnto the chiefe steward, whome when we told, he declared our dreames to vs, to euery one he declared according to his dreame.

13. And as he declared vnto vs, so it came to passe: for he restored me to mine office, & hanged him.

14. Then Pharaoh sent and called 

15. Then Pharaoh sayde to Ioseph, I haue dreamed a dreame, and no man can interprete it, and I haue hearde say of thee, that when thou hearest a dreame, thou canst interprete it.

16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, 

17. And Pharaoh sayde vnto Ioseph, In my dreame, beholde, I stoode by the banke of the riuer:

18. And lo, there came vp out of the riuer seuen fat fleshed, and welfauoured kine, and they fedde in the medowe.

19. Also loe, seuen other kine came vp after them, poore and very euilfauoured, and leanefleshed: I neuer sawe the like in all the lande of Egypt, for euilfauoured.

20. And the leane and euilfauoured kine did eate vp the first seuen fat kine.

21. And when they had eaten them vp, it could not be knowen that they had eaten them, but they were still as euilfauoured, as they were at the beginning: so did I awake.

22. Moreouer I sawe in my dreame, and beholde, seuen eares sprang out of one stalke, full and faire.

23. And lo, seuen eares, withered, thinne, and blasted with the East winde, sprang vp after them.

24. And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen good eares. Nowe I haue tolde the soothsayers, and none can declare it vnto me.

25. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, 

26. The seuen good kine are seuen yeres, and the seuen good eares are seuen yeeres: this is one dreame.

27. Likewise the seuen thinne and euilfauoured kine, that came out after them, are seuen yeeres: and the seuen emptie eares blasted with the East winde, are seuen yeeres of famine.

28. This is the thing which I haue saide vnto Pharaoh, that God hath shewed vnto Pharaoh, what he is about to doe.

29. Beholde, there come seuen yeeres of great plentie in all the land of Egypt.

30. Againe, there shall arise after them seuen yeeres of famine, so that all the plentie shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land:

31. Neither shall the plentie bee knowen in the land, by reason of this famine that shall come after: for it shalbe exceeding great.

32. And therefore the dreame was doubled vnto Pharaoh the second time, because the thing is established by God, & God hasteth to performe it.

33. Now therefore let Pharaoh 

34. Let Pharaoh make and appoynt officers ouer the lande, and take vp the fift part of the land of Egypt in the seuen plenteous yeeres.

35. Also let them gather all the foode of these good yeeres that come, and lay vp corne vnder the hand of Pharaoh for foode, in the cities, and let them keepe it.

36. So the foode shall be for the prouision of the lande, against the seuen yeeres of famine, which shalbe in the lande of Egypt, that the land perish not by famine.

37. And the saying pleased Pharaoh and all his seruants.

38. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the 

39. The Pharaoh said to Ioseph, For as much as God hath shewed thee all this, there is no man of vnderstanding, or of wisedome like vnto thee.

40. Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy 

41. Moreouer Pharaoh said to Ioseph, Behold, I haue set thee ouer all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh tooke off his ring from his hand, and put it vpon Iosephs hand, and arayed him in garments of fine linnen, and put a golden cheyne about his necke.

43. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, 

44. Againe Pharaoh saide vnto Ioseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift vp his hand or his foote in all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called Iosephs name Zaphnath-paaneah: and he gaue him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On. then went Ioseph abrode in the land of Egypt.

46. And Joseph [was] 

47. And in the seuen plenteous yeres the earth brought foorth store.

48. And hee gathered vp all the foode of the seuen plenteous yeeres, which were in the lande of Egypt, and layde vp foode in the cities: the foode of the fielde, that was round about euery citie, layde he vp in the same.

49. So Ioseph gathered wheate, like vnto the sand of the sea in multitude out of measure, vntill he left numbring: for it was without number.

50. Now vnto Ioseph were borne two sonnes (before the yeeres of famine came) which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On bare vnto him.

51. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my 

52. Also hee called the name of the second, Ephraim: For God, sayde he hath made me fruitfull in the land of mine affliction.

53. So the seuen yeeres of the plentie that was in the land of Egypt were ended.

54. Then began the seuen yeeres of famine to come, according as Ioseph had saide: and the famine was in all landes, but in all the land of Egypt was bread.

55. At the length all the lande of Egypt was affamished, and the people cryed to Pharaoh for bread; Pharaoh said vnto all the Egyptians, Goe to Ioseph: what he sayth to you, doe ye.

56. When the famine was vpon all the land, Ioseph opened all places, wherein the store was, and solde vnto the Egyptians: for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

57. And all countries came to Egypt to bye corne of Ioseph, because the famine was sore in all landes.

## Genesis 42

1. Now when 

2. And he said, Behold, I haue heard that there is foode in Egypt, Get you downe thither, & bie vs foode thence, that we may liue and not die.

3. So went Iosephs ten brethren downe to bye corne of the Egyptians.

4. But Beniamin Iosephs brother woulde not Iaakob send with his brethren: for he saide, Least death should befall him.

5. And the sonnes of Israel came to bye foode among them that came: for there was famine in the land of Canaan.

6. Now Ioseph was gouerner of the land, who solde to all the people of the lande: then Iosephs brethren came, & bowed their face to the groud before him.

7. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but 

8. (Now Ioseph knewe his brethren, but they knew not him.

9. And Ioseph remembred the dreames, which he dreamed of them) and he sayde vnto them, Ye are spies, and are come to see the weaknesse of the land.

10. But they sayde vnto him, Nay, my lorde, but to bye vitayle thy seruants are come.

11. Wee are all one mans sonnes: wee meane truely, and thy seruants are no spies.

12. But he saide vnto them, Nay, but yee are come to see the weakenes of the land.

13. And they said, We thy seruants are twelue brethren, the sonnes of one man in the lande of Canaan: and beholde, the yongest is this day with our father, and one is not.

14. Againe Ioseph sayde vnto them, This is it that I spake vnto you, saying, Ye are spies.

15. Hereby ye shall be proved: 

16. Send one of you which may fet your brother, & ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proued, whether there bee trueth in you: or els by the life of Pharaoh ye are but spies.

17. So he put them in warde three dayes.

19. If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bounde in your prison house, and goe ye, carie foode for the famine of your houses:

20. But bring your yonger brother vnto me, that your wordes may be tried, and that ye dye not: and they did so.

21. And they said one to another, 

22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his 

23. (And they were not aware that Ioseph vnderstoode them: for he spake vnto them by an interpreter.)

24. And he turned himself about from them, and 

25. So Ioseph commanded that they should fill their sackes with wheate, and put euery mans money againe in his sacke, and giue them vitaile for the iourney: and thus did he vnto them.

26. And they layed their vitaile vpon their asses, and departed thence.

27. And as one of them opened his sacke for to giue his asse prouender in the ynne, he espyed his money: for lo, it was in his sackes mouth.

28. And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them], and they were 

29. And they came vnto Iaakob their father vnto the lande of Canaan, and tolde him all that had befallen them, saying,

30. The man, who is Lorde of the lande, spake roughly to vs, and put vs in prison as spyes of the countrey.

31. And we sayd vnto him, We are true men, and are no spies.

32. We be twelue brethren, sonnes of our father: one is not, and the yongest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

33. Then the Lord of the countrey sayde vnto vs, Hereby shal I knowe if ye be true men: Leaue one of your brethren with me, and take foode for the famine of your houses and depart,

34. And bring your yongest brother vnto me, that I may knowe that ye are no spies, but true men: so will I deliuer you your brother, and yee shall occupie in the land.

35. And as they emptied their sacks, behold, euery mans bundel of money was in his sacke: and when they and their father sawe the bundels of their money, they were afrayde.

36. And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved [of my children]: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]: all these things are against 

37. Then Reuben answered his father, saying, Slay my two sonnes, if I bring him not to thee againe: deliuer him to mine hand, and I will bring him to thee againe.

38. But he sayd, My sonne shall not go downe with you: for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if death come vnto him by the way which ye goe, then ye shall bring my gray head with sorow vnto the graue.

## Genesis 43

1. And the 

2. And when they had eaten vp the vitaile, which they had brought from Egypt, their father sayd vnto them, Turne againe, and bye vs a little foode.

3. And Iudah answered him, saying, The man charged vs by an othe, saying, Neuer see my face, except your brother be with you.

4. If thou wilt sende our brother with vs, we will goe downe, and bye thee foode:

5. But if thou wilt not send him, we wil not go downe: for the man said vnto vs, Looke me not in the face, except your brother be with you.

6. And Israel sayd, Wherefore delt ye so euill with me, as to tell the man, whether ye had yet a brother or no?

7. And they answered, The man asked straitly of our selues and of our kinred, saying, Is your father yet aliue? haue ye any brother? And wee tolde him according to these wordes: could we knowe certainely that he would say, Bring your brother downe?

8. Then sayde Iudah to Israel his father, Send the boy with mee, that we may rise and goe, and that we may liue and not dye, both we, and thou, and our children.

9. I wil be suertie for him: of mine hand shalt thou require him. If I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me beare the blame for euer.

10. For except we had made this tarying, doutlesse by this we had returned the second time.

11. Then their father Israel sayd vnto them, If it must needes be so now, do thus: take of the best fruites of the lande in your vessels, and bring the man a present, a little rosen, & a little hony, spices and myrrhe, nuttes, and almondes:

12. And take 

13. Take also your brother and arise, and go againe to the man.

14. And 

15. Thus the men tooke this present, & tooke twise so much money in their hande with Beniamin, and rose vp, and went downe to Egypt and stoode before Ioseph.

16. And whe Ioseph saw Beniamin with them, he sayde to his stewarde, Bring these men home and kill meate, and make ready: for the men shal eate with me at noone.

17. And the man did as Ioseph bad, & brought the men vnto Iosephs house.

18. And the men were 

19. Therefore came they to Iosephs stewarde, & communed with him at the doore of ye house.

20. And said, Oh syr, we came in deede down hither at the first time to bye foode,

21. And as wee came to an ynne and opened our sackes, behold, euery mans money was in his sackes mouth, euen our money in full weight, but we haue brought it againe in our handes.

22. Also other money haue we brought in our handes to bye foode, but we cannot tell, who put our money in our sackes.

23. And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: 

24. So the man led them into Iosephs house, & gaue them water to wash their feete, and gaue their asses prouender.

25. And they made ready their present against Ioseph came at noone, (for they heard say, that they should eate bread there)

26. When Ioseph came home, they brought the present into the house to him, which was in their handes, and bowed downe to the grounde before him.

27. And he asked them of their prosperitie, and sayd, Is your father the olde man, of whome ye tolde me, in good health? is he yet aliue?

28. Who answered, Thy seruant our father is in good health, he is yet aliue: and they bowed downe, and made obeysance.

29. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his 

30. And Ioseph made haste (for his affection was inflamed towarde his brother, and sought where to weepe) and entred into his chamber, and wept there.

31. Afterward he washed his face, & came out, and refrained himselfe, and sayd, Set on meate.

32. And they 

33. So they sate before him: the eldest according vnto his age, and the yongest according vnto his youth; the men marueiled among themselues.

34. And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, 

## Genesis 44

1. Afterward he commanded his steward, saying, Fill the mens sackes with foode, as much as they can carry, and put euery mans money in his sackes mouth.

2. And 

3. And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses.

4. And when they went out of the citie not farre off, Ioseph sayd to his stewarde, Vp, followe after the men: and when thou doest ouertake them, say vnto them, Wherefore haue ye rewarded euill for good?

5. [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and 

6. And when he ouertooke them, he sayde those wordes vnto them.

7. And they answered him, Wherefore sayeth my lorde such wordes? God forbid that thy seruants should do such a thing.

8. Behold, the money which we found in our sackes mouthes, wee brought againe to thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steale out of thy lordes house siluer or golde?

9. With whomesoeuer of thy seruants it bee found, let him dye, and we also will be my lordes bondmen.

10. And he said, Now then let it be according vnto your wordes: he with whome it is found, shal be my seruant, and ye shalbe blamelesse.

11. Then at once euery man tooke downe his sacke to the grounde, and euery one opened his sacke.

12. And he searched, and began at the eldest and left at the yongest: and the cuppe was found in Beniamins sacke.

13. Then they 

14. So Iudah and his brethren came to Iosephs house (for he was yet there) and they fel before him on the ground.

15. Then Ioseph sayd vnto them, What acte is this, which ye haue done? know ye not that such a man as I, can deuine and prophecie?

16. And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? 

17. But he answered, God forbid, that I should doe so, but the man, with whome the cuppe is founde, he shalbe my seruant, and go ye in peace vnto your father.

18. Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even 

19. My Lord asked his seruants, saying, Haue ye a father, or a brother?

20. And we answered my Lorde, We haue a father that is olde, and a young childe, which he begate in his age: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loueth him.

21. Now thou saidest vnto thy seruants, Bring him vnto me, that I may set mine eye vpo him.

22. And we answered my lord, The childe can not depart from his father: for if he leaue his father, his father would die.

23. Then saydest thou vnto thy seruants, Except your yonger brother come downe with you, looke in my face no more.

24. So when we came vnto thy seruant our father, and shewed him what my lord had sayd,

25. And our father sayde vnto vs, Goe againe, bye vs a litle foode,

26. Then we answered, We can not go downe: but if our yongest brother go with vs, then will we go downe: for we may not see the mans face, except our yongest brother be with vs.

27. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my 

28. And the one went out from me, and I said, Of a suretie he is torne in pieces, and I sawe him not since.

29. And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, 

30. Nowe therefore, when I come to thy seruant my father, & the childe be not with vs (seeing that his life dependeth on the childes life)

31. Then when hee shall see that the childe is not come, he will die: so shall thy seruants bring the graye head of thy seruant our father with sorowe to the graue.

32. Doubtlesse thy seruant became suertie for the childe to my father, and said, If I bring him not vnto thee againe, then I will beare the blame vnto my father for euer.

33. Nowe therefore, I pray thee, let me thy seruant bide for the childe, as a seruant to my Lord, and let the childe go vp with his brethren.

34. For 

## Genesis 45

1. Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, 

2. And hee wept & cried, so that the Egyptians heard: the house of Pharaoh heard also.

3. Then Ioseph sayde to his brethren, I am Ioseph: doeth my father yet liue? But his brethren coulde not answere him, for they were astonished at his presence.

4. Againe, Ioseph sayde to his brethren, Come neere, I pray you, to mee; they came neere; he sayde, I am Ioseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

5. Now therefore be not 

6. For nowe two yeeres of famine haue bene through ye land, and fiue yeeres are behind, wherein neither shalbe earing nor haruest.

7. Wherefore God sent me before you to preserue your posteritie in this land, & to saue you aliue by a great deliuerance.

8. So now [it was] not you [that] sent me hither, but 

9. Haste you & go vp to my father, & tel him, Thus saieth thy sonne Ioseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come downe to me, tary not.

10. And thou shalt dwel in ye land of Goshen, and shalt be neere me, thou and thy children, and thy childrens children, and thy sheepe, and thy beastes, and all that thou hast.

11. Also I will nourish thee there (for yet remaine fiue yeeres of famine) lest thou perish through pouertie, thou and thy houshold, and all that thou hast.

12. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] 

13. Therefore tel my father of al mine honour in Egypt, and of all that ye haue seene, and make haste, and bring my father hither.

14. Then hee fell on his brother Beniamins necke, & wept, and Beniamin wept on his necke.

15. Moreouer, he kissed all his brethren, and wept vpon them: and afterwarde his brethren talked with him.

16. And the tidinges came vnto Pharaohs house, so that they said, Iosephs brethre are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his seruants.

17. Then Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph, Say to thy brethren, This doe ye, lade your beastes & depart, go to the land of Canaan,

18. And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the 

19. And I commaunde thee, Thus doe ye, take you charets out of the lande of Egypt for your children, and for your wiues, and bring your father and come.

20. Also regarde not your stuffe: for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.

21. And the children of Israel did so: & Ioseph gaue them charets according to the commandement of Pharaoh: hee gaue them vitaile also for the iourney.

22. He gaue them all, none except, change of raiment: but vnto Beniamin he gaue three hundreth pieces of siluer, and fiue sutes of raiment.

23. And vnto his father likewise hee sent ten hee asses laden with the best things of Egypt, and ten shee asses laden with wheate, and bread and meate for his father by the way.

24. So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye

27. And they told him al the words of Ioseph, which he had said vnto the: but when he saw the charets, which Ioseph had sent to cary him, then the spirit of Iaakob their father reuiued.

4. They sayde moreouer vnto Pharaoh, For to soiourne in ye lande are we come: for thy seruants haue no pasture for their sheepe, so sore is ye famine in the lande of Canaan. Nowe therefore, we pray thee, let thy seruants dwel in the land of Goshen.

5. Then spake Pharaoh to Ioseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come vnto thee.

6. The

13. Now there was no bread in all the land: for the famine was exceeding sore: so that the land of Egypt, and the land of Canaan were famished by reason of the famine.

14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and 

15. So when money fayled in the lande of Egypt, and in the lande of Canaan, then all the Egyptians came vnto Ioseph, and sayde, Giue vs bread: for why should we dye before thee? for our money is spent.

16. Then saide Ioseph, Bring your cattell, and I will giue you for your cattell, if your money be spent.

17. So they brought their cattell vnto Ioseph, and Ioseph gaue them bread for the horses, & for the flockes of sheepe, and for the heards of cattel, and for the asses: so he fed them with bread for all their cattell that yeere.

18. But when the yeere was ended, they came vnto him the next yeere, and sayd vnto him, We will not hide from my lord, that since our money is spent, and my lord hath the heards of the cattel, there is nothing left in the sight of my lorde, but our bodies and our ground.

19. Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our

21. And as for the people, he 

22. Onely the lande of the Priestes bought he not: for the Priestes had an ordinarie of Pharaoh, and they did eate their ordinarie, which Pharaoh gaue them: wherefore they solde not their grounde.

23. Then Ioseph sayd vnto the people, Behold, I haue bought you this daye, and your lande for Pharaoh: lo, here is seede for you: sowe therefore the grounde.

24. And of the encrease ye shall giue the fifth part vnto Pharaoh, and foure partes shalbe yours for the seede of the fielde, and for your meate, and for them of your housholdes, and for your children to eate.

25. Then they answered, Thou hast saued our liues: let vs finde grace in the sight of my Lorde, and we will be Pharaohs seruants.

26. And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, [that] Pharaoh should have the fifth [part];

7. Nowe when I came from Padan, Rahel died vpon mine hande in the lande of Canaan, by the way when there was but halfe a dayes iourney of grounde to come to Ephrath: and I buryed her there in the way to Ephrath: the same is Beth-lehem.

8. Then Israel beheld Iosephs sonnes & sayd, Whose are these?

9. And Joseph said unto his father, They [are] my sons, whom 

10. (For the eyes of Israel were dimme for age, so that hee coulde not well see) Then he caused them to come to him, & he kissed them and embraced them.

11. And Israel sayde vnto Ioseph, I had not thought to haue seene thy face: yet lo, God hath shewed me also thy seede.

12. And Ioseph tooke them away from his knees, & did reuerence downe to the ground.

13. Then tooke Ioseph them both, Ephraim in his right hand towarde Israels left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israels right hand, so he brought them vnto him.

14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] upon
