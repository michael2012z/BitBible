## Galatians 1

1. Paul, 

2. And all the brethren which are with me, vnto the Churches of Galatia:

3. Grace be with you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Iesus Christ,

4. 
          

5. To whom be glory for euer and euer, Amen.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be 

9. As we sayd before, so say I now againe, If any man preach vnto you otherwise, then that ye haue receiued, let him be accursed.

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the 

13. 
          

14. And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the 

15. But when it pleased God, who 

16. To reveal his Son 

17. Neither came I againe to Hierusalem to them which were Apostles before me, but I went into Arabia, and turned againe vnto Damascus.

18. Then after three yeeres I came againe to Hierusalem to visite Peter, and abode with him fifteene dayes.

19. And none other of the Apostles sawe I, saue Iames the Lords brother.

20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, 

21. After that, I went into the coastes of Syria and Cilicia:

22. For I was vnknowen by face vnto the Churches of Iudea, which were in Christ.

23. But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the 

24. And they glorified God for me.

## Galatians 2

1. Then 

2. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, 

3. But neither yet Titus which was with me, though he were a Grecian, was compelled to be circumcised,

4. And that because of 

5. To whom we gave place by 

6. But by them which seemed to be great, I was not taught (whatsoeuer they were in time passed, I am nothing the better: God accepteth no mans person) for they that are the chiefe, did adde nothing to me aboue that I had.

7. But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the 

8. (For he that was mightie by Peter in the Apostleship ouer the circumcision, was also mightie by me toward the Gentiles)

9. And when James, Cephas, and John, who 

10. Warning onely that we should remember the poore: which thing also I was diligent to doe.

11. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the 

12. 
          

13. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was 

14. But when I saw that they walked not 

15. 
          

16. Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith 

17. 
          

18. For if I build againe the things that I haue destroyed, I make my selfe a trespasser.

19. For I through the law am dead to the 

20. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not 

21. 
          

## Galatians 3

1. O 

2. This only would I learn of you, Received ye the 

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, 

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, 

21. 
          

22. But the 

23. 
          

24. Wherefore the Lawe was our scholemaster to bring vs to Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith.

25. But after that faith is come, we are no longer vnder a scholemaster.

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all 

29. And if ye be Christes, then are ye Abrahams seede, and heires by promes.

## Galatians 4

1. Now 

2. But is under tutors and governors 

3. Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the 

4. 
          

5. To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the 

6. 
          

7. Wherefore thou art no more a 

8. 
          

9. But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and 

10. Ye obserue dayes, and moneths, and times and yeeres.

11. I am in feare of you, lest I haue bestowed on you labour in vaine.

12. 
          

13. Ye know how through 

14. And my 

15. 
          

16. Am I therefore become your enemie, because I tell you the trueth?

17. They zealously affect you, 

18. But [it is] good to be 

19. My litle children, of whome I trauaile in birth againe, vntill Christ be formed in you.

20. I desire to be present with you now, and to 

21. 
          

22. For it is written, that Abraham had two sonnes, one by a seruant, and one by a free woman.

23. But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the 

24. Which things are an allegory: for 

25. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and 

26. But Jerusalem which is 

27. 
          

28. Now we, brethren, 

29. But as then he that was born after the 

30. But what sayth the Scripture? Put out the seruant and her sonne: for the sonne of the seruant shall not be heire with the sonne of the free woman.

31. 
          

## Galatians 5

1. Stand fast therefore in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made vs free, and be not intangled againe with the yoke of bondage.

2. 
          

3. For I testifie againe to euery man, which is circumcised, that he is bound to keepe the whole Lawe.

4. Christ is

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; 

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. For the 

18. And if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not vnder the Lawe.

19. 
          

20. Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, seditions, heresies,

21. Enuie, murthers, drunkennesse, gluttonie, and such like, whereof I tell you before, as I also haue tolde you before, that they which doe such things, shall not inherite the kingdome of God.

22. But the 

23. Meekness, temperance: 

24. For they that are Christes, haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes.

## Galatians 6

1. Brethren, 

2. 
          

3. For if any man seeme to himselfe, that he is somewhat, when he is nothing, hee deceiueth himselfe in his imagination.

4. But let euery man prooue his owne worke: and then shal he haue reioycing in himselfe onely and not in another.

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. For he that soweth to his

13. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in 

14. 
          

15. For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision, but a newe creature.

16. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the
