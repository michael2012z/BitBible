## Judges 1

1. Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel 

2. And the Lord said, Iudah shall goe vp: behold, I haue giuen the land into his hande.

3. And Judah said unto Simeon his 

4. Then Iudah went vp, and the Lorde deliuered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.

5. And they founde Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and slewe the Canaanites, and the Perizzites.

6. But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and 

7. And Adoni-bezek said, Seuentie Kings hauing the thumbes of their hands & of their feete cut off, gathered bread vnder my table: as I haue done, so God hath rewarded me. so they brought him to Ierusalem, and there he died.

8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the 

9. Afterwarde also the children of Iudah went downe to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountaine, and towarde the South, and in the lowe countrey.

10. And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjatharba:) and they slew 

11. And from thence hee went to the inhabitantes of Debir, and the name of Debir in olde time was Kiriath-sepher.

12. And Caleb saide, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, euen to him wil I giue Achsah my daughter to wife.

13. And Othniel the sonne of Kenaz Calebs yonger brother tooke it, to whome hee gaue Achsah his daughter to wife.

14. And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: 

15. And shee answered him, Giue mee a blessing: for thou hast giuen me a South countrey, giue me also springs of water: and Caleb gaue her the springs aboue and the springs beneath.

16. And the children of the 

17. But Iudah went with Simeon his brother, and they slewe the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and vtterly destroied it, and called the name of the citie Hormah.

18. Also Judah took 

19. And the Lord was with Iudah, and he possessed the mountaines: for he could not driue out the inhabitantes of the valleis, because they had charrets of yron.

20. And they gaue Hebron vnto Caleb, as Moses had saide, and hee expelled thence the three sonnes of Anak.

21. And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that 

22. They also that were of the house of Ioseph, went vp to Beth-el, and the Lord was with them,

23. And the house of Ioseph caused to viewe Beth-el (and the name of the citie beforetime was Luz)

24. And the spies sawe a man come out of the citie, and they saide vnto him, Shewe vs, we praie thee, the way into the citie, and we will shewe thee mercie.

25. And when hee had shewed them the waie into the citie, they smote the citie with the edge of the sworde, but they let the man and all his housholde depart.

26. Then the man went into the lande of the Hittites, and built a citie, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof vnto this daie.

27. Neither did Manasseh drive out [the inhabitants of] Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: 

28. Neuerthelesse when Israel was strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute, and expelled them not wholly.

29. Likewise Ephraim expelled not the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

30. Neither did 

31. Neither did Asher cast out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob,

32. But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them 

33. Neither did Naphtali driue out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the lande: neuerthelesse the inhabitantes of Beth-shemesh, and of Beth-anath became tributaries vnto them.

34. And the Amorites droue the children of Dan into the mountaine: so that they suffered them not to come downe to the valley.

35. But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the

1. And an 

2. Ye also shall make no couenant with the inhabitants of this land, but shall breake downe their altars: but ye haue not obeyed my voyce. Why haue ye done this?

3. Wherefore, I sayd also, I wil not cast them out before you, but they shalbe as thornes vnto your sides, & their gods shalbe your destruction.

4. And when the Angel of the Lorde spake these wordes vnto all the children of Israel, the people lift vp their voyce, and wept.

5. Therefore they called the name of that place, Bochim, and offered sacrifices there vnto the Lord.

6. And when Joshua had 

7. And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great 

8. But Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of the Lord dyed, when he was an hundreth and ten yeeres olde:

9. And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in 

10. And so all that generation was gathered vnto their fathers, & another generation arose after them, which neither knewe the Lord, nor yet the works, which he had done for Israel.

11. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served 

12. And forsooke ye Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the lande of Egypt, & followed other gods, euen the gods of the people that were round about them, & bowed vnto them, and prouoked the Lord to anger.

13. And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and 

14. And the wrath of the Lorde was hote against Israel, & he deliuered them into the hands of spoylers, that spoyled them, and he sold them into the handes of their enemies rounde about them, so that they could no longer stande before their enemies.

15. 
          

16. Notwithstanding, the Lorde raysed vp Iudges, which deliuered them out of the hands of their oppressours.

17. And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the 

18. And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings 

19. Yet when the Iudge was dead, they returned, and did worse then their fathers, in following other gods to serue them and worshippe them: they ceased not from their owne inuentions, nor from their rebellious way.

20. Wherfore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sayd, Because this people hath transgressed my couenant, which I commaded their fathers, & hath not obeyed my voyce,

21. I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the

23. So the Lorde left those nations, and droue them not out immediately, neither deliuered them into the hand of Ioshua.

## Judges 3

1. Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the 

2. Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew 

3. Fiue princes of the Philistims, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, & the Hiuites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon vntill one come to Hamath.

4. And these remayned to proue Israel by them, to wit, whether they would obey the commandements of the Lorde, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

5. And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, & the Amorites, and the Perizzites, & the Hiuites, and the Iebusites,

6. And they took 

7. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the 

8. Therefore the wrath of the Lorde was kindled against Israel, and he solde them into the hand of Chushan rishathaim King of Aram-naharaim, and the children of Israel serued Chushan rishathaim eyght yeeres.

9. And when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lorde, the Lord stirred vp a sauiour to ye children of Israel, & he saued them, euen Othniel the sonne of Kenaz, Calebs yonger brother.

10. And the 

11. And the land had rest 

12. And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD 

13. And he gathered vnto him the children of Ammon, and Amalek, & went and smote Israel, and they possessed the citie of palme trees.

14. So the children of Israel serued Eglon king of Moab eighteene yeeres.

15. But when the children of Israel cried vnto the Lorde, the Lorde stirred them vp a sauiour, Ehud the sonne of Gera the sonne of Iemini, a man lame of his right hande: and the children of Israel sent a present by him vnto Eglon King of Moab.

16. And Ehud made him a dagger with two edges of a cubite length, and he did gird it vnder his rayment vpon his right thigh,

17. And he presented ye gift vnto Eglon King of Moab (and Eglon was a very fat man)

18. And when he had now presented the present, he sent away the people that bare ye present,

19. But he himself turned again from the 

20. Then Ehud came vnto him. (and he sate alone in a sommer parler, which he had) and Ehud said, I haue a message vnto thee from God. Then he arose out of his throne,

21. And Ehud put forth his left hand, & tooke the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his bellie,

22. So that the hafte went in after the blade, and the fatte closed about the blade, so that he could not drawe the dagger out of his bellie, but the dirt came out.

23. Then Ehud gate him out into the porch, and shut the doores of the parler vpon him, and locked them.

24. And when he was gone out, his seruantes came: who seeing that the doores of the parler were locked, they sayd, Surely he doeth his easement in his sommer chamber.

25. And they taryed till they were ashamed: & seeing he opened not the doores of the parler, they tooke the key, and opened them, & behold, their lord was fallen dead on the earth.

26. So Ehud escaped (while they taried) & was passed the quarris, and escaped vnto Seirah.

27. And when he came home, he blew a trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel went downe with him from the mountaine, and he went before them.

28. Then said he vnto them, Follow me: for the Lorde hath deliuered your enemies, euen Moab into your hand. So they went downe after him, & tooke the passages of Iorden towarde Moab, and suffred not a man to passe ouer.

29. And they slewe of the Moabites the same time about ten thousand men, all fed men, & all were warriours, and there escaped not a man.

30. So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the 

31. And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox 

## Judges 4

1. And the children of Israel began againe to do wickedly in the sight of the Lorde when Ehud was dead.

2. And the LORD sold them into the hand of 

3. Then the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord: (for he had nine hundreth charets of yron, and twentie yeeres he had vexed the children of Israel very sore)

4. And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she 

5. And this Deborah dwelt vnder a palme tree, betweene Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came vp to her for iudgement.

6. And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel 

7. And I wil drawe vnto thee to the riuer Kishon Sisera, the captaine of Iabins armie with his charets, and his multitude, and wil deliuer him into thine hand.

8. And Barak said unto her, 

9. Then shee answered, I will surely goe with thee, but this iourney that thou takest, shall not be for thine honour: for the Lord shal sell Sisera into the hand of a woman; Deborah arose & went with Barak to Kedesh.

10. And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went vp on his feete with ten thousand men, and Deborah went vp with him.

11. Now Heber the Kenite, [which was] of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent 

12. Then they shewed Sisera, that Barak the sonne of Abinoam was gone vp to mout Tabor.

13. And Sisera called for all his charets, euen nine hundreth charets of yron, and all the people that were with him from Harosheth of the Gentiles, vnto the riuer Kishon.

14. And Deborah said unto Barak, 

15. And the Lorde destroyed Sisera and all his charets, & al his hoste with the edge of the sword before Barak, so that Sisera lighted downe off his charet, and fled away on his feete.

16. But Barak pursued after the charets, and after the hoste vnto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the hoste of Sisera fel vpon the edge of the sworde: there was not a man left.

17. Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of 

18. And Iael went out to meete Sisera, & sayd vnto him, Turne in, my lord, turne in to me: feare not; when he had turned in vnto her into her tent, she couered him with a mantell.

19. And he said vnto her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water to drinke: for I am thirstie; shee opened a bottel of milke, and gaue him drinke, and couered him.

20. Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, 

21. Then Jael Heber's wife took a 

22. And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her [tent], behold, Sisera lay 

23. So God brought downe Iabin the King of Canaan that day before the children of Israel.

24. And the hande of the children of Israel prospered, and preuailed against Iabin the King of Canaan, vntill they had destroyed Iabin King of Canaan.

## Judges 5

1. Then sang Deborah, and Barak the sonne of Abinoam the same day, saying,

2. Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the 

3. Heare, ye Kings, hearken ye princes: I, euen I will sing vnto the Lord: I will sing praise vnto the Lord God of Israel.

4. Lorde, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou departedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heauens rained, the cloudes also dropped water.

5. The mountaines melted before the Lord, as did that Sinai before the Lord God of Israel.

6. In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were 

7. [The inhabitants of] the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a 

8. They chose new gods; then [was] war in the gates: was there a 

9. Mine heart is set on the gouernours of Israel, and on them that are willing among the people: praise ye the Lord.

10. Speak, ye that ride on 

11. For the noyse of the archers appaised among the drawers of water: there shal they rehearse the righteousnesse of the Lorde, his righteousnesse of his townes in Israel: then did the people of the Lord goe downe to the gates.

12. Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead 

13. For they that remaine, haue dominio ouer the mightie of the people: the Lorde hath giuen me dominion ouer the strong.

14. Out of Ephraim 

15. And the princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah; even 

16. Why abodest thou among the sheepefolds, to heare the bleatings of the flockes? for the diuisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart.

17. 
          

18. But the people of Zebulun and Naphtali haue ieopard their liues vnto the death in the hie places of the field.

19. The kings came [and] fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of 

20. They fought from heauen, euen the starres in their courses fought against Sisera.

21. The river of Kishon 

22. Then were the horsehooues broken with the oft beating together of their mightie men.

23. Curse ye 

24. Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite shall be blessed aboue other women: blessed shall she be aboue women dwelling in tentes.

25. He asked water, [and] she gave [him] milk; she brought forth 

26. She put her hand to the naile, & her right hand to the workemans hammer: with the hammer smote she Sisera: she smote off his head, after she had wounded, and pearsed his temples.

27. He bowed him downe at her feete, he fell downe, and lay still: at her feete hee bowed him downe, and fell: and when he had sunke downe, he lay there dead.

28. The mother of Sisera looked out at a windowe, and cryed thorowe the lattesse, Why is his charet so long a comming? why tary the wheeles of his charets?

29. Her wise ladies answered her, yea, 

30. Have they not sped? have they [not] divided the prey; to every man a damsel [or] two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, [meet] 

31. So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but [let] them that love him [be] as the 

## Judges 6

1. Afterwarde the children of Israel committed wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, and the Lorde gaue them into the handes of Midian seuen yeres.

2. And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: 

3. When Israel had sowen, then came vp the Midianites, the Amalekites, & they of the East, and came vpon them,

4. And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto 

5. For they went vp, and their cattel, & came with their tentes as grashoppers in multitude: so that they & their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.

6. And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the 

7. And when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord because of the Midianites,

8. The Lord sent vnto the children of Israel a Prophet, who sayd vuto them, Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, I haue brought you vp from Egypt, and haue brought you out of the house of bondage,

9. And I haue deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and haue cast them out before you, and giuen you their land.

10. And I sayde vnto you, I am the Lord your God: feare not the gods of the Amorites in whose lande you dwell: but ye haue not obeyed my voyce.

11. And the Angell of the Lord came, and sate vnder the oke which was in Ophrah, that perteined vnto Ioash the father of the Ezrites, and his sonne Gideon threshed wheate by the winepresse, to hide it from the Midianites.

12. Then the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him, and said vnto him, The Lord is with thee, thou valiant man.

13. And Gideon said unto him, 

14. And the 

15. And he answered him, Ah my Lord, whereby shal I saue Israel? beholde, my father is poore in Manasseh, and I am the least in my fathers house.

16. Then the Lord sayd vnto him, I wil therefore be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites, as one man.

17. And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me 

18. Depart not hence, I pray thee, vntil I come vnto thee, and bring mine offring, and lay it before thee; he sayde, I will tary vntill thou come againe.

19. And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an 

20. And the Angell of God saide vnto him, Take the flesh and the vnleauened bread, and lay them vpon this stone, and powre out the broth: and he did so.

21. Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that [was] in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire 

22. And when Gideon perceiued that it was an Angel of the Lord, Gideon then sayde, Alas, my Lord God: for because I haue seene an Angell of the Lord face to face, I shall die.

23. And the Lord said vnto him, Peace be vnto thee: feare not, thou shalt not die.

24. Then Gideon made an altar there vnto the Lord, and called it, Iehouah shalom: vnto this day it is in Ophrah, of the father of the Ezrites.

25. And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock 

26. And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the 

27. Then Gideon tooke tenne men of his seruants, and did as ye Lord bade him: but because he feared to doe it by day for his fathers housholde, and the men of the citie, he did it by night.

28. And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that [was] by it, and the 

29. Therefore they saide one to another, Who hath done this thing? and when they inquired & asked, they saide, Gideon the sonne of Ioash hath done this thing.

30. Then the men of the citie said vnto Ioash, Bring out thy sonne, that hee may dye: for he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath also cut downe the groue that was by it.

31. And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? 

32. And in that day was Gideon called Ierubbaal, that is, Let Baal pleade for himselfe because he hath broken downe his altar.

33. Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and they of ye East, were gathered together, aud went and pitched in the valley of Izreel.

34. But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and 

35. And he sent messengers thorowout al Manasseh, which also was ioyned with him, and he sent messengers vnto Asher, and to Zebulun and to Naphtali, and they came vp to meete them.

36. And Gideon said unto God, 

37. Beholde, I wil put a fleece of wooll in the threshing place: if the dewe come on the fleece onely, and it be drie vpon all the earth, then shall I be sure, that thou wilt saue Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.

38. And so it was: for he rose vp earely on the morow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, and filled a bowle of water.

39. Againe, Gideon sayde vnto God, Be not angry with me, that I may speake once more: let me prooue once againe, I pray thee, with the fleece: let it now be drie onely vpon the fleece, and let dewe be vpon all the ground.

40. And God did so that night: for it was 

## Judges 7

1. Then Ierubbaal (who is Gideon) rose vp early, and all the people that were with him, and pitched beside the well of Harod, so that the hoste of the Midianites was on the Northside of them in the valley by the hill of Moreh.

2. And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that [are] with thee [are] too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel 

3. Now therefore proclaime in the audience of the people, and say, Who so is timerous or fearefull, let him returne, and depart earely from mount Gilead; there returned of the people which were at mount Gilead, two and twentie thousand: so ten thousand remayned.

4. And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people [are] yet [too] many; bring them down unto the water, and I will 

5. So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; 

6. And the nomber of them that lapped by putting their handes to their mouthes, were three hundreth men: but all the remnant of the people kneeled downe vpo their knees to drinke water.

7. And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the [other] 

8. So the people tooke vitailes with them, & their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel, euery man vnto his tent, and reteined the three hundreth men: and the hoste of Midian was beneath him in a valley.

9. And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, 

10. But if thou feare to go downe, then go thou, and Phurah thy seruant downe to the hoste,

11. And thou shalt hearken what they say, and so shal thine handes be strong to go downe vnto the hoste. Then went he downe and Phurah his seruant vnto the outside of the souldiers that were in the hoste.

12. And the Midianites, and the Amalekites and all they of the East, lay in the valley like grashoppers in multitude, and their camels were without nomber, as the sande which is by the sea side for multitude.

13. And when Gideon was come, behold, [there was] a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a 

14. And his fellow answered, and sayde, This is nothing els saue the sworde of Gideon the sonne of Ioash a man of Israel: for into his hande hath God deliuered Midian and all the hoste.

15. And it was [so], when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he 

16. And he divided the three hundred men [into] three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps 

17. And he sayd vnto them, Looke on me, and do likewise, when I come to the side of the hoste: euen as I do, so do you.

18. When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that [are] with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, 

19. So Gideon and the hundreth men that were with him, came vnto the outside of the hoste, in the beginning of the middle watche, and they raised vp the watchmen, and they blew with their trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their handes.

20. And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow [withal]: and they cried, The 

21. And they stoode, euery man in his place round about the hoste: and all the hoste ranne, and cryed, and fled.

22. And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his 

23. Then the men of Israel being gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, pursued after the Midianites.

24. And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the

## Judges 8

1. And the men of Ephraim said unto him, 

2. And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of 

3. God hath deliuered into your handes the princes of Midian, Oreb & Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? & when he had thus spoken, then their spirits abated toward him.

4. And Gideon came to Iorden to passe ouer, hee, and the three hundreth men that were with him, weary, yet pursuing them.

5. And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, 

6. And the princes of Succoth said, [Are] the 

7. Gideon then sayde, Therefore when the Lorde hath deliuered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, I will teare your flesh with thornes of the wildernes and with breers.

8. And he went vp thence to Penuel, and spake vnto them likewise, and the men of Penuel answered him, as the men of Succoth answered.

9. And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again 

10. Now Zebah and Zalmunna [were] 

11. And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in 

12. And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, hee followed after them, and tooke the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the hoste.

13. And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle

15. And he came vnto the men of Succoth, & sayd, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, by whome ye vpbrayded me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah & Zalmunna already in thine hands, that we should giue bread vnto thy weary men?

16. Then he tooke the Elders of the citie, and thornes of the wildernes & breers, & did teare the men of Succoth with them.

17. Also he brake downe the towre of Penuel, and slew the men of the citie.

18. Then saide he vnto Zebah & Zalmunna, What maner of men were they, whom ye slew at Tabor? and they answered, As thou art, so were they: euery one was like the children of a King.

19. And he said, They [were] my brethren, [even] the 

20. Then he sayde vnto Iether his first borne sonne, Vp, & slay them: but the boy drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet yong.

21. Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for

24. And Gideon said unto them, 

25. And they answered, Wee will giue them; they spred a garment, and did cast therein euery man the earings of his pray.

26. And the weight of the golden earings that he required, was a thousande and seuen hundreth shekels of golde, beside collers and iewels, and purple rayment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the cheynes that were about their camels neckes.

27. And Gideon made an

29. Then Ierubbaal the sonne of Ioash went, and dwelt in his owne house.

30. And Gideon had seuentie sonnes begotten of his body: for he had many wiues.

31. And his concubine that was in Shechem, bare him a sonne also, whose name he called Abimelech.

32. And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in

3. Then his mothers brethren spake of him in the audience of all the men of Shechem, all these wordes: and their hearts were moued to followe Abimelech: for sayd they, He is our brother.

4. And they gaue him seuentie pieces of siluer out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vayne and light fellowes which followed him.

5. And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and 

6. And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of

9. But the oliue tree said vnto them, Should I leaue my fatnes, wherewith by me they honour God & man, & go to aduance me aboue ye trees?

10. Then the trees sayde to the fig tree, Come thou, and be King ouer vs.

11. But the fig tree answered them, Should I forsake my sweetenesse, and my good fruite, and goe to aduance me aboue the trees?

12. Then sayd the trees vnto the Vine, Come thou, and be king ouer vs.

13. But the Vine sayde vnto them, Should I leaue my wine, whereby I cheare God and man, and goe to aduance me aboue the trees?

14. Then said all the trees vnto the bramble, Come thou, and reigne ouer vs.

15. And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, [then] come [and] put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let 

16. Now therefore, if ye doe truely and vncorruptly to make Abimelech King, and if ye haue delt well with Ierubbaal and with his house, and haue done vnto him according to the deseruing of his handes,

17. (For my father fought for you, and aduentured his life, and deliuered you out of the handes of Midian.

18. And yee are risen vp against my fathers house this day, and haue slayne his children, about seuentie persons vpon one stone, and haue made Abimelech the sonne of his mayde seruant, King ouer the men of Shechem, because hee is your brother)

19. If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, [then] 

20. But if not, let a fire come out from Abimelech, and consume the men of Shechem and the house of Millo: also let a fire come foorth from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and consume Abimelech.

21. And Iotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there for feare of Abimelech his brother.

22. So Abimelech reigned three yeere ouer Israel.

23. Then God 

24. That the crueltie toward the seuentie sonnes of Ierubbaal and their blood might come & be laide vpon Abimelech their brother, which had slayne them, and vpon the men of Shechem, which had ayded him to kill his brethren.

25. So the men of Shechem set men in wayte for him in the toppes of the mountaines: who robbed all that passed that way by them: and it was tolde Abimelech.

26. Then Gaal the sonne of Ebed came with his brethren, and they went to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.

27. And they 

28. Then Gaal the sonne of Ebed sayde, Who is Abimelech? and who is Shechem, that wee should serue him? Is he not the sonne of Ierubbaal? and Zebul is his officer? Serue rather the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serue him?

29. And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to 

30. And when Zebul the ruler of the citie heard the wordes of Gaal the sonne of Ebed, his wrath was kindled.

31. Therefore he sent messengers vnto Abimelech priuily, saying, Beholde, Gaal the sonne of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem, and beholde, they fortifie the citie against thee.

32. Now therefore arise by night, thou & the people that is with thee, and lye in wayte in the fielde.

33. And rise early in the morning as soone as the sunne is vp, and assault the citie: and when he and the people that is with him, shall come out against thee, doe to him what thou canst.

34. So Abimelech rose vp, and all the people that were with him by night: and they lay in wayte against Shechem in foure bandes.

35. Then Gaal the sonne of Ebed went out & stood in the entring of the gate of the citie: and Abimelech rose vp, and the folke that were with him, from lying in waite.

36. And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the 

37. And Gaal spake againe, and said, See, there come folke downe by the middle of the land, and another bande commeth by the way of the plaine of Meonenim.

38. Then sayd Zebul vnto him, Where is now thy mouth, that said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serue him? Is not this the people that thou hast despised? Go out now, I pray thee, and fight with them.

39. And Gaal 

40. But Abimelech pursued him, and he fledde before him, and many were ouerthrowen and wounded, euen vnto the entring of the gate.

41. And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: & Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in Shechem.

42. And on the morowe, the people went out into the fielde: which was tolde Abimelech.

43. And he took the 

44. And Abimelech, and the bandes that were with him, russhed forwarde, and stoode in the entring of the gate of the citie: and the two other bandes ran vpon all the people that were in the fielde and slewe them.

45. And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that [was] therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with 

46. And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard [that], they entered into an hold of the house of the god 

47. And it was tolde Abimelech, that all the men of the towre of Shechem were gathered together.

48. And Abimelech gate him vp to mounte Zalmon, hee and all the people that were with him: and Abimelech tooke axes with him, and cut downe boughes of trees, and tooke them, and bare them on his shoulder, and sayde vnto the folke that were with him, What ye haue seene me doe, make haste, and doe like me.

49. And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put [them] to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem 

50. Then went Abimelech to Tebez, and besieged Tebez, and tooke it.

51. But there was a strong towre within the citie, and thither fledde all the men and women, and all the chiefe of the citie, and shut it to them, and went vp to the toppe of the towre.

52. And Abimelech came vnto the towre and fought against it, and went hard vnto the doore of the towre to set it on fire.

53. But a certaine woman cast a piece of a milstone vpon Abimelechs head, and brake his braine pan.

54. Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man 

55. And when the men of Israel sawe that Abimelech was dead, they departed euery man vnto his owne place.

56. Thus God rendred the wickednes of Abimelech, which he did vnto his father, in slaying his seuentie brethren.

57. And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the 

## Judges 10

1. After Abimelech there arose to defend Israel, Tola, the sonne of Puah, the sone of Dodo, a man of Issachar, which dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.

2. And he iudged Israel three and twentie yeere and dyed, and was buried in Shamir.

3. And after him arose Iair a Gileadite, and iudged Israel two and twenty yeere.

4. And he had thirty sons that 

5. And Iair dyed, and was buried in Kamon.

6. And the children of Israel wrought wickednesse againe in the sight of the Lord, and serued Baalim and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistims, and forsooke the Lord and serued not him.

7. Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he solde them into the hands of the Philistims, and into the handes of the children of Ammon:

8. And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, 

9. Moreouer, the children of Ammon went ouer Iorden to fight against Iudah, and against Beniamin, and against the house of Ephraim: so that Israel was sore tormented.

10. And the children of Israel 

11. And the LORD 

12. The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites did oppresse you, and ye cryed to me and I saued you out of their hands.

13. Yet ye haue forsaken me, and serued other gods: wherefore I will deliuer you no more.

14. Goe, and cry vnto the gods which ye haue chosen: let them saue you in the time of your tribulation.

15. And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, 

16. And they put away the strange gods from among them, and 

17. Then the children of Ammon gathered themselues together, and pitched in Gilead: and the children of Israel assembled themselues, and pitched in Mizpeh.

18. And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, Whosoeuer will beginne the battell against the children of Ammon, the same shal be head ouer all the inhabitants of Gilead.

## Judges 11

1. Then Gilead begate Iphtah, and Iphtah the Gileadite was a valiant man, but the sonne of an harlot.

2. And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou [art] the son of a

5. And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the 

6. And they said unto Jephthah, 

7. And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and 

8. Then the Elders of Gilead saide vnto Iphtah, Therefore we turne againe to thee now, that thou mayest goe with vs, and fight against the children of Ammon, and bee our head ouer all the inhabitants of Gilead.

9. And Iphtah said vnto the Elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home againe to fight against the children of Ammon, if the Lord giue them before me, shall I be your head?

10. And the Elders of Gilead saide to Iphtah, The Lorde be witnesse betweene vs, if we doe not according to thy wordes.

11. Then Iphtah went with the Elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captaine ouer them: and Iphtah rehearsed all his wordes before the Lorde in Mizpeh.

12. Then Iphtah sent messengers vnto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to doe with me, that thou art come against me, to fight in my lande?

13. And the King of the children of Ammon answered vnto the messengers of Iphtah, Because Israel tooke my lande, when they came vp from Egypt, fro Arnon vnto Iabbok, & vnto Iorden: now therefore restore those lands quietly.

14. Yet Iphtah sent messengers againe vnto the King of the children of Ammon,

15. And said vnto him, Thus saith Iphtah, Israel tooke not the lande of Moab, nor the lande of the children of Ammon.

16. But when Israel came vp from Egypt, and walked through the wildernesse vnto the redde Sea, then they came to Kadesh.

17. And Israel sent messengers vnto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, goe thorowe thy lande: but the King of Edom woulde not consent: and also they sent vnto the King of Moab, but he would not: therefore Israel abode in Kadesh.

18. Then they went through the wildernesse, and compassed the lande of Edom, and the lande of Moab, and came by the Eastside of the lande of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, and came not within the coast of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.

19. Also Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, the King of Heshbon, and Israel said vnto him, Let vs passe, we pray thee, by thy lande vnto our place.

20. But Sihon 

21. And the Lorde God of Israel gaue Sihon and all his folke into the handes of Israel, & they smote them: so Israel possessed all the lande of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that countrey:

22. And they possessed all the coast of the Amorites, from Arnon vnto Iabbok, and from the wildernesse euen vnto Iorden.

23. Nowe therefore the Lorde God of Israel hath cast out the Amorites before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possesse it?

24. Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the 

25. And art thou nowe farre better then Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab? did he not striue with Israel and fight against them,

26. While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that [be] along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover 

27. Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge 

28. Howbeit the King of the children of Ammon hearkened not vnto the wordes of Iphtah, which he had sent him.

29. Then the 

30. And Jephthah 

31. Then that thing that commeth out of the doores of mine house to meete me, when I come home in peace from the children of Ammon, shall be the Lordes, and I will offer it for a burnt offering.

32. And so Iphtah went vnto the children of Ammon to fight against them, and the Lord deliuered them into his handes.

33. And he smote them from Aroer euen till thou come to Minnith, twentie cities, and so foorth to Abel of the vineyardes, with an exceeding great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were humbled before the children of Israel.

34. And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with

37. And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and 

38. And he sayde, Goe: and he sent her away two moneths: so she went with her companions, and lamented her virginitie vpon the moutaines.

39. And after the ende of two moneths, she turned againe vnto her father, who did with her according to his vowe which he had vowed, and she had knowen no man; it was a custome in Israel:

40. The daughters of Israel went yere by yere to lament the daughter of Iphtah the Gileadite, foure dayes in a yeere.

## Judges 12

1. And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went 

2. And Iphtah said vnto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon, and when I called you, ye deliuered me not out of their handes.

3. And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not, 

4. Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim 

5. Also the Gileadites tooke the passages of Iorden before the Ephraimites, and when the Ephraimites that were escaped, saide, Let me passe, then the men of Gilead said vnto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay,

6. Then said they unto him, Say now 

7. And Iphtah iudged Israel sixe yeere: then dyed Iphtah the Gileadite, and was buryed in one of the cities of Gilead.

8. And after him 

9. Who had thirtie sonnes and thirtie daughters, which he sent out, & tooke in thirtie daughters from abroade for his sonnes; he iudged Israel seuen yeere.

10. Then Ibzan died, and was buryed at Bethlehem.

11. And after him iudged Israel Elon, a Zebulonite, and he iudged Israel tenne yeere.

12. Then Elon the Zebulonite dyed, and was buryed in Aijalon in the countrey of Zebulun.

13. And after him Abdon the sonne of Hillel the Pirathonite iudged Israel.

14. And he had fourty sonnes and thirtie nephewes that rode on seuentie assecoltes: and he iudged Israel eight yeeres.

15. Then dyed Abdon the sonne of Hillel the Pirathonite, & was buryed in Pirathon, in ye lande of Ephraim, in the Mount of the Amalekites.

## Judges 13

1. Bvt the children of Israel continued to commit wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, and the Lorde deliuerd them into the handes of the Philistims fourtie yeere.

2. And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name [was] Manoah; and his wife [was] 

3. And the Angel of the Lorde appeared vnto the woman, and said vnto her, Beholde nowe, thou art baren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceiue, and beare a sonne.

4. And nowe therefore beware that thou drinke no wine, nor strong drinke, neither eate any vncleane thing.

5. For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a 

6. Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance [was] like the countenance of an angel of God, very 

7. But he saide vnto me, Beholde, thou shalt conceiue, and beare a sonne, and nowe thou shalt drinke no wine, nor strong drinke, neither eate any vncleane thing: for the childe shalbe a Nazarite to God from his birth to the day of his death.

8. Then Manoah 

9. And God heard the voyce of Manoah, and the Angel of God came againe vnto the wife, as she sate in the fielde, but Manoah her husbande was not with her.

10. And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the 

11. And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the 

12. Then Manoah sayde, Nowe let thy saying come to passe: but howe shall we order the childe and doe vnto him?

13. And the Angell of the Lorde saide vnto Manoah, The woman must beware of all that I said vnto her.

14. She may not eat of any [thing] that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any 

15. Manoah then said vnto the Angell of the Lorde, I pray thee, let vs reteine thee, vntill we haue made readie a kid for thee.

16. And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the 

17. Againe Manoah said vnto the Angell of the Lorde, What is thy name, that when thy saying is come to passe, we may honour thee?

18. And the Angell of the Lorde saide vnto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, which is secret?

19. So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered [it] upon a rock unto the LORD: and [the angel] did 

20. For when the flame came vp toward heauen from the altar, the Angel of the Lorde ascended vp in the flame of the altar, and Manoah and his wife behelde it, and fell on their faces vnto the grounde.

21. (So the Angel of the Lorde did no more appeare vnto Manoah and his wife.) Then Manoah knewe that it was an Angel of the Lord.

22. And Manoah said vnto his wife, We shal surely dye, because we haue seene God.

23. But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a

25. And the Spirite of the Lorde beganne to strengthen him in the host of Dan, betweene Zorah, and Eshtaol.

3. Then his father and his mother said unto him, [Is there]

6. And the Spirit of the LORD 

7. And he went down, & talked with the woman which was beautifull in the eyes of Samson.

8. And within a fewe dayes, when he returned to receiue her, he went aside to see the karkeis of the Lion: and behold, there was a swarme of bees, and hony in the body of the Lyon.

9. And he tooke therof in his handes, and went eating, and came to his father and to his mother, and gaue vnto them, and they did eate: but hee told not them, that he had taken the hony out of the body of the lyon.

10. So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a

12. And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty 

13. But if you cannot declare it mee, then shall yee giue mee thirty sheetes and thirtie change of garments; they answered him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may heare it.

14. And he sayd vnto them, Out of the eater came meate, and out of the strong came sweetenesse: and they could not in three dayes expound the riddle.

15. And it came to pass 

16. And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the

18. And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? and what [is] stronger than a lion? And he said unto them,

5. And when he had set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the

8. So hee smote them hippe and thigh with a mightie plague: then hee went and dwelt in the top of the rocke Etam.

9. Then the Philistims came vp, and pitched in Iudah, and were spred abroad in Lehi.

10. And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To 

11. Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines [are] rulers over us? 

12. Againe they sayd vnto him, Wee are come to binde thee, and to deliuer thee into the hande of the Philistims; Samson sayde vnto them, Sweare vnto me, that yee will not fall vpon me your selues.

13. And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and 

14. When hee came to Lehi, the Philistims shouted against him, and the Spirite of the Lord came vpon him, and the cordes that were vpon his armes, became as flaxe that was burnt with fire: for the bandes loosed from his handes.

15. And he found a

17. And when he had left speaking, hee cast away the iawebone out of his hande, and called that place, Ramath-Lehi.

18. And he was sore athirst, and 

19. Then God brake the cheeke tooth, that was in the iawe, and water came thereout: and when he had drunke, his Spirit came againe, and he was reuiued: wherefore the name therof is called, Enhakkore, which is in Lehi vnto this day.

3. And Samson slept till midnight, and arose at midnight, and tooke the doores of the gates of the citie, and the two postes and lift them away with the barres, and put them vpon his shoulders, and caried them vp to the top of the mountaine that is before Hebron.

4. And after this hee loued a woman by the riuer of Sorek, whose name was Delilah:

5. And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred 

6. And Delilah saide to Samson, Tell mee, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest bee bound, to doe thee hurt.

7. Samson then answered vnto her, If they binde mee with seuen greene cordes, that were neuer dryed, then shall I bee weake, and be as an other man.

8. And the princes of the Philistims brought her seuen greene cordes that were not dry, and she bound him therewith.

9. Now [there were] 

10. And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now 

11. Then he answered her, If they binde mee with newe ropes that neuer were occupied, then shal I be weake, and be as an other man.

12. Delilah therefore tooke newe ropes, and bounde him therewith, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson: (and men lay in wayte in the chamber) and hee brake them from his armes, as a threede.

13. And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. 

14. And she fastened it with a pinne, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson; he awoke out of his sleepe, and went away with the pinne of the webbe and the woufe.

15. And she said unto him, How canst thou say, 

16. And because shee was importunate vpon him with her wordes continually, and vexed him, his soule was pained vnto the death.

17. That he told her all his

19. And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went 

20. Then she said, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson; hee awoke out of his sleepe, and thought, I will go out now as at other times, and shake my selfe, but he knewe not that the Lorde was departed from him.

21. Therefore the Philistims tooke him, and put out his eyes, and brought him downe to Azzah, and bounde him with fetters: and hee did grinde in the prison house.

24. Also when the people saw him, they praysed their god: for they sayde, Our god hath deliuered into our hands our enemie and destroyer of our countrey, which hath slayne many of vs.

25. And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he 

26. Then Samson saide vnto the seruant that led him by the hande, Lead me, that I may touch the pillars that the house standeth vpon, and that I may leane to them.

27. (Nowe the house was full of men and women, and there were all the princes of the Philistims: also vpon the roofe were about three thousande men and women that behelde while Samson played)

28. And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once 

29. And Samson layd hold on the two middle pillars whereupon the house stood, and on which it was borne vp: on the one with his right hand, and on the other with his left.

30. And Samson said, 

31. Then his brethren, and all the house of his father came downe and tooke him, and brought him vp and buryed him betweene Zorah & Eshtaol, in the sepulchre of Manoah his father: nowe he had iudged Israel twenty yeeres.

9. And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, 

10. Then Michah said vnto him, Dwell with me, and be vnto me a father and a Priest, and I will giue thee ten shekels of siluer by yeere, and a sute of apparell, and thy meate and drinke. So the Leuite went in.

5. Againe they said vnto him, Aske counsell nowe of God, that we may knowe whether the way which we goe, shalbe prosperous.

6. And the priest said unto them, 

7. Then the fiue men departed and came to Laish, and sawe the people that were therein, which dwelt carelesse, after the maner of the Zidonians, quiet and sure, because no man made any trouble in the lande, or vsurped any dominion: also they were farre from the Zidonians, and had no businesse with other men.

8. So they came againe vnto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren saide vnto them, What haue ye done?

9. And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it [is] very good: and 

10. (If ye will goe, ye shall come vnto a carelesse people, and the countrey is large) for God hath giuen it into your hande. It is a place which doeth lacke nothing that is in the worlde.

11. Then there departed thence of the familie of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, sixe hundreth men appointed with instruments of warre.

12. And they went vp, and pitched in Kiriath-iearim in Iudah: wherefore they called that place, Mahaneh-Dan vnto this day: and it is behinde Kiriath-iearim.

13. And they went thence vnto mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Michah.

14. Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, 

15. And they turned thitherward & came to the house of the yong man the Leuite, euen vnto the house of Michah, and saluted him peaceably.

16. And the six hundreth men appointed with their weapons of warre, which were of the children of Dan, stoode by the entring of the gate.

19. And they answered him, Holde thy peace: lay thine hande vpon thy mouth, and come with vs to be our father and Priest. Whether is it better that thou shouldest be a Priest vnto ye house of one man, or that thou shouldest be a Priest vnto a tribe and to a familie in Israel?

20. And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the 

21. So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage 

22. When they were farre off from the house of Michah, the men that were in the houses neere to Michahs house, gathered together, and pursued after the children of Dan,

23. And cryed vnto the children of Dan: who turned their faces, and said vnto Michah, What ayleth thee, that thou makest an outcrie?

## Judges 19

1. Also in those dayes, when there was no king in Israel, a certaine Leuite dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim, and tooke to wife a concubine out of Beth-lehem Iudah,

2. And his concubine played ye whore there, and went away from him vnto her fathers house to Beth-lehem Iudah, and there continued the space of foure moneths.

3. And her husband arose and went after her, to speake friendly vnto her, and to bring her againe: he had also his seruant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him vnto her fathers house, and when the yong womans father sawe him, he reioyced of his coming.

4. And his father in lawe, the yong womans father reteined him: & he abode with him three dayes: so they did eate & drinke, & lodged there.

5. And when the fourth day came, they arose earely in the morning, and he prepared to depart: then the yong womans father said vnto his sonne in lawe, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and then go your way.

6. And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the

8. And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, 

9. And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go 

10. But the man would not tarry, but arose & departed, and came ouer against Iebus, (which is Ierusalem) and his two asses laden, and his concubine were with him.

11. When they were neere to Iebus, the day was sore spent, and the seruant said vnto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let vs turne into this citie of the Iebusites, and lodge all night there.

12. And his master said unto him, 

13. And he said vnto his seruant, Come, and let vs drawe neere to one of these places, that wee may lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.

14. So they went forward vpon their way, and the sunne went downe vpon them neere to Gibeah, which is in Beniamin.

15. Then they turned thither to goe in and lodge in Gibeah: and when he came, he sate him downe in a streete of the citie: for there was no man that tooke them into his house to lodging.

16. And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which [was] also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place [were] 

17. And when he had lift vp his eyes, he sawe a wayfairing man in the streetes of the citie: then this olde man sayde, Whither goest thou, and whence camest thou?

18. And he said unto him, We [are] passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence [am] I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I [am now] going to the 

19. Although we haue straw and prouader for our asses, and also bread and wine for me & thine handmayde, and for the boy that is with thy seruant: we lacke nothing.

20. And the olde man sayde, Peace bee with thee: as for all that thou lackest, shalt thou finde with me: onely abide not in the streete al night.

21. So he brought him into his house, & gaue fodder vnto the asses: and they washed their feete, and did eate and drinke.

22. [Now] as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, [and] 

23. And this man the master of ye house went out vnto the, & said vnto them, Nay my brethre, do not so wickedly, I pray you: seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this villenie.

24. Behold, [here is] my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, 

25. But the men woulde not hearken to him: therefore ye man tooke his concubine, & brought her out vnto them: and they knewe her and abused her all the night vnto the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her goe.

26. Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and 

27. And her lorde arose in the morning, and opened the doores of the house, and went out to goe his way, and beholde, the woman his concubine was dead at the doore of the house and her handes lay vpon the thresholde.

28. And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her [up] upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his 

29. And whe he was come to his house, he took a knife, and laid hand on his concubine, and deuided her in pieces with her bones into twelue parts, and sent her through all quarters of Israel.

4. And the same Leuite, the womans husband that was slaine, answered and saide, I came vnto Gibeah that is in Beniamin with my concubine to lodge,

5. And the men of Gibeah arose against me, and beset the house round about vpon mee by night, thinking to haue slaine me, and haue forced my concubine that she is dead.

6. And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent

15. And ye children of Beniamin were nombred at that time out of the cities sixe and twenty thousand men that drewe sworde, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were nombred seuen hundreth chosen men.

16. Of all this people were seuen hundreth chosen men, being left handed: all these could sling stones at an heare breadth, and not faile.

17. Also the men of Israel, beside Beniamin, were nombred foure hundreth thousande men that drew sword, euen all men of warre.

18. And the children of Israel arose, and went up 

19. Then the children of Israel arose vp earely and camped against Gibeah.

20. And the men of Israel went out to battell against Beniamin, & the men of Israel put themselues in aray to fight against the beside Gibeah.

21. And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day 

22. And the people, the men of Israel plucked vp their hearts, and set their battel againe in aray in the place where they put them in aray the first day.

23. (For the children of Israel had gone vp and wept before the Lord vnto the euening, and had asked of the Lorde, saying, Shall I goe againe to battel against the children of Beniamin my brethren? and the Lord said, Go vp against them)

24. Then the children of Israel came neere against the children of Beniamin the second day.

25. Also the second day Beniamin came forth to meete them out of Gibeah, and slewe downe to the grounde of the children of Israel againe eighteene thousand men: all they could handle the sword.

26. Then al the children of Israel went vp and all the people came also vnto the house of God, and wept and sate there before the Lord & fasted that day vnto the euening, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings before the Lord.

11. And this is it that ye shall do: ye shall vtterly destroye all the males and all the women that haue lien by men.

12. And they found among the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead foure hundreth maides, virgins that had knowne no man by lying with any male: and they brought them vnto the hoste to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

15. And the people were sorie for Beniamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

16. Therefore the Elders of the Congregation said, How shall we doe for wiues to the remnant? for the women of Beniamin are destroyed.

17. And they said, [There must be] 

18. Howbeit we may not giue them wiues of our daughters: for the childre of Israel had sworne, saying, Cursed be he that giueth a wise to Beniamin.
