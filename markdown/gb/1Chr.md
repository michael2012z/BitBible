4. And these are the names of the children which he had at Ierusalem, Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Salomon,

5. And Ibhar, and Elishua, and 

6. And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Iaphia,

7. And Elishama, and Beeliada, & Eliphalet.

8. But when the Philistims heard that Dauid was anointed King ouer Israel, all the Philistims came vp to seeke Dauid; when Dauid heard, he went out against them.

9. And the Philistims came, and spred them selues in the valley of Rephaim.

10. Then Dauid asked counsel at God, saying, Shall I goe vp against the Philistims, and wilt thou deliuer them into mine hande? And the Lorde saide vnto him, Goe vp: for I will deliuer them into thine hande.

11. So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place 

12. And there they had left their gods: and Dauid said, Let them euen be burnt with fire.

13. Againe the Philistims came and spread them selues in the valley.

14. And when Dauid asked againe counsell at God, God said to him, Thou shalt not goe vp after them, but turne away from them, that thou mayest come vpon them ouer against the mulberie trees.

15. And when thou hearest the noyse of one going in the toppes of the mulberie trees, then goe out to battel: for God is gone foorth before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistims.

16. So Dauid did as God had commaunded him: and they smote the hoste of the Philistims from Gibeon euen to Gezer.

17. And the fame of Dauid went out into all landes, and the Lorde brought the feare of him vpon all nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. And [David] made him houses in the 

2. Then Dauid saide, None ought to carie the Arke of God, but the Leuites: for the Lorde hath chosen them to beare the Arke of the Lord, and to minister vnto him for euer.

3. And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the 

4. And Dauid assembled the sonnes of Aaron, and the Leuites.

5. Of the sonnes of Kohath, Vriel the chiefe, and his brethren sixe score.

6. Of the sonnes of Merari, Asaiah the chiefe, and his brethren two hundreth and twentie.

7. Of the sonnes of Gershom, Ioel the chiefe, and his brethren an hundreth and thirtie.

8. Of the sons of 

9. Of the sons of 

10. Of the sonnes of Vzziel, Amminadab the chiefe, and his brethren an hundreth and twelue.

11. And Dauid called Zadok and Abiathar the Priestes, and of the Leuites, Vriel, Asaiah and Ioel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab:

12. And said unto them, Ye [are] the chief of the fathers of the Levites: 

13. For because ye [did it] not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due 

14. So the Priestes and the Leuites sanctified them selues to bring vp the Arke of the Lorde God of Israel.

15. And the sonnes of the Leuites bare the Arke of God vpon their shoulders with the barres, as Moses had commanded, according to the worde of the Lorde.

16. And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren [to be] the singers with 

17. So the Leuites appointed Heman the sonne of Ioel, and of his brethren Asaph the sonne of Berechiah, and of the sonnes of Merari their brethren, Ethan the sonne of Kushaiah,

18. And with them their brethren of the 

19. So Heman, Asaph and Ethan were fingers to make a sounde with cymbales of brasse,

20. And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on

23. And Berechiah and Elkanah were porters for the Arke.

24. And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah [were] doorkeepers 

25. So Dauid and the Elders of Israel and the captaines of thousandes went to bring vp the Arke of the couenant of the Lord from the house of Obed Edom with ioye.

26. And it came to pass, when God 

27. And David [was] clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also [had] upon him an 

28. Thus all Israel brought vp the Arke of the Lordes couenant with shouting and sounde of cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbales, making a sound with violes and with harpes.

29. And it came to pass, [as] the ark of the 

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. So they brought in the Arke of God, and set it in the middes of the Tabernacle that Dauid had pitched for it, and they offred burnt offrings and peace offrings before God.

2. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he 

3. And he dealt to euery one of Israel both man and woman, to euery one a cake of breade, and a piece of flesh, and a bottel of wine.

4. And he appointed [certain] of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to 

5. Asaph the chiefe, and next to him Zechariah, Ieiel, and Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, & Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed Edom, euen Ieiel with instruments, violes and harpes, and Asaph to make a sound with cymbales,

6. And Benaiah and Iahaziel Priestes, with trumpets continually before the Arke of the couenant of God.

7. Then on that day David 

8. Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his 

9. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his 

10. Reioyce in his holy Name: let the hearts of them that seeke the Lord reioyce.

11. Seeke the Lord and his strength: seeke his face continually.

12. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the 

13. O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his 

14. He is the Lorde our God: his iudgements are throughout all the earth.

15. Remember his couenant for euer, and the worde, which hee commaunded to a thousand generations:

16. Which he made with Abraham, and his othe to Izhak:

17. And hath confirmed it to Iaakob for a Law, & to Israel for an euerlasting couenant,

18. Saying, To thee will I giue the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.

19. When ye were but 

20. And walked about from nation to nation, and from one kingdome to another people,

21. He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved 

22. [Saying], Touch not mine 

23. Sing vnto the Lord all the earth: declare his saluation from day to day.

24. Declare his glory among the nations, and his wonderful workes among all people.

25. For the Lorde is great & much to be praised, and hee is to bee feared aboue all gods.

26. For all the gods of the people [are] 

27. Prayse and glory are before him: power & beautie are in his place.

28. Giue vnto the Lord, ye families of the people: giue vnto the Lord glory and power.

29. Giue vnto the Lorde ye glory of his Name: bring an offring and come before him, and worship the Lorde in the glorious Sanctuarie.

30. 
          

31. Let the 

32. Let the sea roare, and all that therein is: Let the field be ioyfull and all that is in it.

33. Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to

35. And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, [and] 

36. Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, 

37. Then he left there before the Arke of the Lordes couenant Asaph and his brethren to minister continually before the Arke, that which was to be done euery day:

38. And Obed Edom and his brethren, three score and eight: and Obed Edom the sonne of Ieduthun, and Hosah were porters.

39. And Zadok the Priest and his brethren the Priestes were before the Tabernacle of ye Lorde, in the hie place that was at Gibeon,

40. To offer burnt offrings vnto the Lord, vpon the burnt offring altar continually, in the morning and in the euening, euen according vnto all that is written in the law of the Lord, which hee commaunded Israel.

41. And with 

42. Euen with them were Heman & Ioduthun, to make a sound with the cornets and with the cymbales, with excellent instruments of musicke: and the sonnes of Ieduthun were at the gate.

43. And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to 

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of 

2. Then Nathan said unto David, Do 

3. And it came to pass the same 

4. Goe, and tell Dauid my seruant, Thus saith the Lorde, Thou shalt not buylde me an house to dwell in:

5. For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from 

6. Wheresoever I have 

7. Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, 

8. And I haue bene with thee whithersoeuer thou hast walked, and haue destroyed all thine enemies out of thy sight, and haue made thee a name, like the name of the great men that are in the earth.

9. Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will 

10. And since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will 

11. And when thy dayes shalbe fulfilled to go with thy fathers, then will I rayse vp thy seede after thee, which shalbe of thy sonnes, and will stablish his kingdome.

12. He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for 

13. I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took [it] from [him] that was before 

14. But I wil establish him in mine house, and in my kingdome for euer, and his throne shalbe stablished for euer,

15. According to all these wordes, and according to al this vision. So Nathan spake to Dauid.

16. And David the king 

17. And [yet] this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast [also] spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of 

18. What can Dauid desire more of thee for the honour of thy seruant? for thou knowest thy seruant.

19. O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own 

20. Lorde, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we haue heard with our eares.

21. Moreouer what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whose God went to redeeme them to be his people, and to make thy selfe a Name, and to doe great and terrible things by casting out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast deliuered out of Egypt?

22. For thou hast ordeined thy people Israel to be thine owne people for euer, and thou Lord art become their God.

23. Therefore nowe Lorde, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant & concerning his house, be confirmed for euer, and doe as thou hast sayd,

24. Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God of 

25. For thou, O my God, hast 

26. Therefore nowe Lord (for thou art God, & hast spoken this goodnesse vnto thy seruant)

27. Now therfore, it hath pleased thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it may bee before thee for euer: for thou, O Lord, hast blessed it, and it shalbe blessed for euer.

## 1 Chronicles 18

1. Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took 

2. And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became Dauids seruants, and brought giftes.

3. And Dauid smote Hadarezer King of Zobah vnto Hamath, as he went to stablish his border by the riuer Perath.

4. And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and twentie thousand footemen, and destroyed all the charets, but he reserued of them an hundreth charets.

5. Then came the Aramites of Damascus to succour Hadarezer King of Zobah, but Dauid slewe of the Aramites two and twentie thousand.

6. Then David put [garrisons] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the LORD 

7. And Dauid tooke the shieldes of gold that were of the seruants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Ierusalem.

8. Likewise from 

9. Then Tou King of Hamath heard howe Dauid had smitten all the hoste of Hadarezer King of Zobah:

10. He sent 

11. Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all [these] nations; from 

12. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt 

13. And he put a garison in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauids seruantes: and the Lord preserued Dauid wheresoeuer he went.

14. So Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgement and iustice to all his people.

15. And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the hoste, and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud recorder,

16. And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub, and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar were the Priests, & Shausha the Scribe,

1. After this also Nahash the King of the children of Ammon dyed, and his sonne reigned in his stead.

2. And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his 

3. But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to 

4. Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and 

5. And there went certaine and tolde Dauid concerning the men: and he sent to meete them (for the men were exceedingly ashamed) and the King saide, Tarie at Iericho, vntill your beardes be growen: then returne.

6. And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of 

7. So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before 

8. And when Dauid heard, he sent Ioab and all the hoste of the valiant men.

9. And the children of Ammon came out, and set their battell in aray at the gate of the citie; the Kings that were come, were by them selues in the fielde.

10. When Ioab saw that the front of the battel was against him before and behinde, then he chose out of all the choyse of Israel, and set him selfe in aray to meete the Aramites.

11. And the rest of the people he deliuered vnto the hande of Abishai his brother, and they put them selues in aray against the children of Ammon.

12. And he saide, If Aram be too strong for me, then thou shalt succour me: and if the children of Ammon preuaile against thee, then I wil succour thee.

13. Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our 

14. So Ioab and the people that was with him, came neere before the Aramites vnto the battel, and they fled before him.

15. And when the children of Ammon sawe that the Aramites fled, they fled also before Abishai his brother, and entred into the citie: so Ioab came to Ierusalem.

16. And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that [were] beyond the 

17. And when it was shewed Dauid, he gathered all Israel, and went ouer Iorden, and came vnto them, & put him selfe in aray against them: And when Dauid had put him selfe in battel aray to meete the Aramites, they fought with him.

18. But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians 

19. And when the seruants of Hadarezer sawe that they fell before Israel, they made peace with Dauid, and serued him; the Aramites would no more succour the children of Ammon.

## 1 Chronicles 20

1. And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out [to battle], Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged 

2. And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a 

3. And he caryed away the people that were in it, and cut them with sawes, and with harowes of yron, and with axes: euen thus did Dauid with all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then Dauid and all the people came againe to Ierusalem.

4. And after this also there arose warre at Gezer with the Philistims: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slewe Sippai, of the children of Haraphah, and they were subdued.

5. And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew 

6. And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, whose fingers and toes [were] four and twenty, 

7. And when he reuiled Israel, Iehonathan the sonne of Shimea Dauids brother did slay him.

8. These were borne vnto Haraphah at Gath, and fell by the hand of Dauid: and by the hands of his seruants.

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. And 

2. And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from 

3. And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they [be]: but, my lord the king, [are] they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of 

4. Neuerthelesse the Kings word preuailed against Ioab; Ioab departed and went thorowe all Israel, and returned to Ierusalem.

5. And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all [they of] Israel were 

6. But the Leuites and Beniamin counted he not among them: for the Kings worde was abominable to Ioab.

7. And God was displeased with this thing: therefore he smote Israel.

8. Then Dauid saide vnto God, I haue sinned greatly, because I haue done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, remooue the iniquitie of thy seruant: for I haue done very foolishly.

9. And the Lorde spake vnto Gad Dauids Seer, saying,

10. Goe and tell Dauid, saying, Thus saith the Lorde, I offer thee three thinges: choose thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee.

11. So Gad came to Dauid, and sayde vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Take to thee

12. Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to be destroyed before thine aduersaries, and the sworde of thine enemies to take thee, or els the sworde of the Lorde and pestilence in the lande three dayes, that the Angel of the Lorde may destroy throughout all the coastes of Israel: nowe therefore aduise thee, what word I shal bring againe to him that sent me.

13. And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a wonderfull strait. Let me nowe fall into the hande of the Lorde: for his mercies are exceeding great, and let me not fall into the hande of man.

14. So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seuentie thousande men.

15. And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and 

16. And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and sawe the Angel of the Lorde stande betweene the earth and the heauen with his sworde drawen in his hand, and stretched out towarde Ierusalem. Then Dauid and the Elders of Israel, which were clothed in sacke, fell vpon their faces.

17. And David said unto God, [Is it] not I [that] commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but [as for] these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on 

18. Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should goe vp, and set vp an altar vnto the Lord in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.

19. So Dauid went vp according to the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the Name of the Lorde.

20. And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him 

21. And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and sawe Dauid, and went out of the thresshing floore, and bowed himselfe to Dauid with his face to the grounde.

22. Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of [this] threshingfloor, that I may build an 

23. Then Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take it to thee, and let my lord the King do that which seemeth him good: loe, I giue thee bullockes for burnt offrings, and thresshing instruments for wood, and wheat for meate offring, I giue it all.

24. And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full 

25. So David gave to Ornan for the place 

26. And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he 

27. And when the Lorde had spoken to the Angel, he put vp his sworde againe into his sheath.

28. At that time when Dauid sawe that the Lorde had heard him in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. (But the Tabernacle of the Lorde which Moses had made in the wildernesse, and the altar of burnt offring were at that season in the hie place at Gibeon.

30. And Dauid could not go before it to aske counsel at God: for he was afraide of the sworde of the Angel of the Lorde.)

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. Then David said, This [is] the

4. And cedar trees without nomber: for the Zidonians and they of Tyrus brought much cedar wood to Dauid.

5. And Dauid saide, Salomon my sonne is yong and tender, and we must builde an house for the Lorde, magnificall, excellent and of great fame and dignitie throughout all countreyes. I will therefore nowe prepare for him. So Dauid prepared very much before his death.

6. Then he called Salomon his sonne, and charged him to builde an house for the Lorde God of Israel.

7. And Dauid said to Salomon, My sonne, I purposed with my selfe to builde an house to the Name of the Lorde my God,

8. But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

9. Beholde, a sonne is borne to thee, which shalbe a man of rest, for I will giue him rest from all his enemies rounde about: therefore his name is Salomon: and I will sende peace and quietnes vpon Israel in his dayes.

10. Hee shall builde an house for my Name, and he shalbe my sonne, and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdome vpon Israel for euer.

11. Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and 

12. Only the LORD give thee 

13. Then thou shalt prosper, if thou take heede to obserue the statutes and the iudgements which the Lorde commanded Moses for Israel: be strong and of good courage: feare not, neither bee afraide.

14. Now, behold, in my 

15. Moreouer thou hast workmen with thee enough, hewers of stone, and workemen for timber, and all men expert in euery worke.

16. Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, [there is] no number. 

17. Dauid also commanded all the princes of Israel to helpe Salomon his sonne, saying,

18. [Is] not the LORD your God with you? and hath he [not] given you rest on every side? for he hath given the

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. So when Dauid was olde and full of dayes, he made Salomon his sonne King ouer Israel.

2. And hee gathered together all the princes of Israel with the Priestes and the Leuites.

3. And the Leuites were numbred from ye age of thirtie yeere and aboue, and their nomber according to their summe was eight & thirtie thousand men.

4. Of these foure and twentie thousande were set to aduance the worke of the house of the Lord, & sixe thousand were ouerseers and iudges.

5. And foure thousand were porters, and foure thousande praised the Lorde with instruments which he made to praise the Lord.

6. So Dauid deuided offices vnto them, to wit, to the sonnes of Leui, to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

7. Of the Gershonites were Laadan & Shimei.

8. The sonnes of Laadan, the chiefe was Iehiel, and Zetham and Ioel, three.

9. The Sonnes of Shimei, Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haram, three: these were the chiefe fathers of Laadan.

10. Also the sonnes of Shimei were Iahath, Zina, Ieush, and Beriah: these foure were ye sonnes of Shimei.

11. And Iahath was the chiefe, and Zizah the seconde, but Ieush and Beriah had not many sonnes: therfore they were in the families of their father, counted but as one.

12. The sonnes of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron aud Vzziel, foure.

13. The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should

16. Of the sonnes of Gershom was Shebuel the chiefe.

17. And the sons of Eliezer [were], Rehabiah the 

18. The sone of Izhar was Shelomith ye chiefe.

19. The sonnes of Hebron were Ieriah the first, Amariah the second, Iahaziel the third, and Iekamiam the fourth.

20. The sones of Vzziel were Michah the first, and Isshiah the second.

21. The sonnes of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sonnes of Mahli, Eleazar and Kish.

22. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their 

23. The sonnes of Mushi were Mahli, & Eder, and Ierimoth, three.

24. These [were] the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; [even] the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of 

25. For Dauid sayde, The Lord God of Israel hath giuen rest vnto his people, that they may dwell in Ierusalem for euer.

26. And also the Leuites shall no more beare the Tabernacle and al the vessels for the seruice thereof.

27. Therefore according to the last wordes of Dauid, the Leuites were nombred from twentie yeere and aboue,

28. Because their office [was] to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the 

29. Both for the shewbread, and for the fine floure, for the meate offring, and for the vnleauened cakes, and for the fryed things, and for that which was rosted, and for all measures and cise,

31. And to offer all burnt offrings vnto the Lorde, in the Sabbaths, in the moneths, and at the appointed times, according to the nomber and according to their custome continually before the Lorde,

32. And that they should keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the charge of ye holy place, & the charge of ye sonnes of Aaron their brethren in the seruice of ye house of the Lord.

1. These are also the diuisions of the sonnes of Aaron: The sonnes of Aaron were Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

2. But Nadab and Abihu died
