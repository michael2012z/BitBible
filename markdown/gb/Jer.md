1. The 

2. To whom the 

3. It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the 

4. Then the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,

5. Before I 

6. Then said I, 

7. But the Lord said vnto me, Say not, I am a childe: for thou shalt goe to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoeuer I command thee, shalt thou speake.

8. Be not afraide of their faces: for I am with thee to deliuer thee, saith the Lord.

9. Then the LORD put forth his hand, and 

10. See, I have this day set thee over the 

11. Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a 

12. Then saide the Lorde vnto me, Thou hast seene aright: for I will hasten my worde to performe it.

13. And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling 

14. Then the LORD said to me, Out of the 

15. For loe, I will call all the families of the kingdomes of the North, saith the Lord, and they shall come, and euery one shall set his throne in the entring of the gates of Ierusalem, and on all the walles thereof rounde about, and in all the cities of Iudah.

16. And I will utter my 

17. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I 

18. For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an 

19. For they shall fight against thee, but they shall not preuaile against thee: for I am with thee to deliuer thee, sayth the Lord.

## Jeremiah 2

1. Moreouer, the woorde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

2. Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the 

3. Israel [was] 

4. Heare ye the word of the Lord, O house of Iaakob, and all the families of the house of Israel.

5. Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they have gone 

6. Neither said they, Where [is] the LORD that brought us out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of 

7. And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit of it and the goodness of it but when ye entered, ye defiled 

8. The priests said not, 

9. Wherefore I will yet 

10. For pass over the isles of 

11. Hath a nation changed [their] gods, which [are] yet no gods? but my people have changed their 

12. Be astonished, O ye 

13. For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me 

14. [Is] Israel a 

15. The young 

16. Also the children of 

17. Hast thou not procured this to thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he 

18. And now what hast thou to do in the way of 

19. Thy own wickedness shall 

20. For of old time I have broken thy yoke, [and] burst thy bands; and thou saidst, 

21. Yet I had planted thee, a noble vine, whose plants were all natural: howe then art thou turned vnto me into the plants of a strange vine?

22. For though thou shalt wash thee with 

23. How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not 

24. A wild 

25. Withhold thy foot from 

26. As the 

27. Saying to a tree, Thou [art] my 

28. But where [are] thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for [according 

29. Why will 

30. In vain have I smitten your children; they have received no correction: your 

31. O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a 

32. Can a maid forget her ornament, or a bride her attire? yet my people haue forgotten me, daies without number.

33. Why trimmest thou thy way to 

34. Also in thy 

35. Yet thou saiest, Because I am giltles, surely his wrath shall turne from mee: beholde, I will enter with thee into iudgement, because thou saiest, I haue not sinned.

36. Why dost thou go about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, 

37. Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thy hands upon 

## Jeremiah 3

1. They 

2. Lift up thy eyes to the high places, and see where thou hast not been lain with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the 

3. Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no 

4. Wilt thou not from this time cry 

5. Wil he keepe his anger for euer? Will he reserue it to the ende? Thus hast thou spoken, but thou doest euill, euen more and more.

6. The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen [that] which backsliding 

7. And I sayde, when shee had done all this, Turne thou vnto me: but she returned not, as her rebellious sister Iudah sawe.

8. And I saw, when for all the causes by which backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put 

9. And it came to pass through the 

10. And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned to me with 

11. And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel hath 

12. Go and proclaim these words toward 

13. Only acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast 

14. O yee disobedient children, turne againe, sayeth the Lorde, for I am your Lorde, and I will take you one of a citie, and two of a tribe and wil bring you to Zion,

15. And I will giue you pastours according to mine heart, which shal feede you with knowledge and vnderstanding.

16. And it shall come to pass, when ye shall be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The 

17. At that time they shall call Jerusalem 

18. In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the 

19. But I sayde, Howe did I take thee for children and giue thee a pleasant lande, euen the glorious heritage of the armies of the heathen, and saide, Thou shalt call mee, saying, My father, and shalt not turne from me?

20. Surely [as] a wife treacherously departeth from her 

21. 
          

22. Return, ye backsliding children, [and] I will heal your backslidings. 

23. Truly the hope of the hilles is but vaine, nor the multitude of mountaines: but in the Lorde our God is the health of Israel.

24. For shame hath devoured the labour of our 

25. We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: 

## Jeremiah 4

1. If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, 

2. And thou shalt 

3. For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up 

4. Breake vp your fallowe ground, and sowe not among the thornes: be circumcised to the Lord, & take away the foreskinnes of your hearts, ye men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem, lest my wrath come foorth like fire, and burne, that none can quenche it, because of the wickednesse of your inuentions.

5. 
          

6. Set up the standard toward Zion: 

7. The 

8. Wherefore girde you with sackecloth: lament, and howle, for the fierce wrath of the Lord is not turned backe from vs.

9. And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, [that] the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the 

10. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly 

11. At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry 

12. A mightie winde shall come vnto me from those places, and nowe will I also giue sentence vpon them.

13. Behold, he shall come up as 

14. O Ierusalem, wash thine heart from wickednes, that thou maiest be saued: how long shall thy wicked thoughtes remaine within thee?

15. For a voice declareth from 

16. Make ye mention of the heathen, and publish in Ierusalem, Beholde, the skoutes come from a farre countrey, and crie out against the cities of Iudah.

17. As keepers of a 

18. Thy wayes and thine inuentions haue procured thee these things, such is thy wickednesse: therefore it shall be bitter, therefore it shall perce vnto thine heart.

19. My distress, my 

20. Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my 

21. Howe long shall I see the standert, and heare the sounde of the trumpet?

22. For my people [are] foolish, they have not known me; they [are] silly children, and they have no understanding: 

23. I beheld the earth, and, lo, [it was] without form, and 

24. I behelde the mountaines: and loe, they trembled and all the hilles shooke.

25. I behelde, and loe, there was no man, and all the birdes of the heauen were departed.

26. I behelde, and loe, the fruitfull place was a wildernesse, and all the cities thereof were broken downe at the presence of the Lorde, and by his fierce wrath.

27. For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I 

28. Therefore shall the earth mourne, and the heauens aboue shall be darkened, because I haue pronounced it: I haue thought it, and will not repent, neither will I turne backe from it.

29. The whole citie shall flee, for the noyse of the horsemen and bowemen: they shall goe into thickets, and clime vp vpon the rockes: euery citie shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

30. And [when] thou [art] laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou 

31. For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, [and] the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, [that] bewaileth herself, [that] spreadeth her hands, [saying], 

## Jeremiah 5

1. Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its broad places, if ye can find a man, if there is [any] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon 

2. And though they say, The 

3. O LORD, [are] not thy eyes upon the 

4. Therefore I saide, Surely they are poore, they are foolish, for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the iudgement of their God.

5. I will go to the 

6. Wherefore a 

7. How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and 

8. They rose vp in the morning like fed horses: for euery man neyed after his neighbours wife.

9. Shall I not visite for these things, saith the Lorde? Shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this?

10. 
          

11. For the house of Israel, and the house of Iudah haue grieuously trespassed against me, saith the Lord.

12. They have 

13. And the prophets shall become 

14. Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in 

15. Lo, I will bring a nation upon you 

16. Their quiver [is] as an 

17. And they shall eate thine haruest and thy bread: they shall deuoure thy sonnes and thy daughters: they shall eate vp thy sheepe and thy bullocks: they shall eate thy vines and thy figge trees: they shall destroy with the sworde thy fensed cities, wherein thou didest trust.

18. Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with 

19. And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth the LORD our God all these [things] to us? then shalt 

20. Declare this in the house of Iaakob, and publish it in Iudah, saying,

21. Heare nowe this, O foolish people, and without vnderstanding, which haue eyes and see not, which haue eares and heare not.

22. Feare ye not me, saith the Lord? Or will ye not be afraide at my presence, which haue placed the sand for the bounds of the sea by the perpetuall decree that it cannot passe it, and though the waues thereof rage, yet can they not preuaile, though they roare, yet can they not passe ouer it?

23. But this people hath an vnfaithfull and rebellious heart: they are departed and gone.

24. For they say not in their heart, Let vs nowe feare the Lorde our God, that giueth raine both early and late in due season: hee reserueth vnto vs the appointed weekes of the haruest.

25. Your 

26. For among my people are founde wicked persons, that lay waite as hee that setteth snares: they haue made a pit, to catch men.

27. As a cage is full of birdes, so are their houses full of deceite: thereby they are become great and waxen riche.

28. They have become fat, they shine: yea, they exceed the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they 

29. Shall I not visite for these things, sayth the Lord? or shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this?

30. An horrible and filthie thing is committed in the land.

31. The 

## Jeremiah 6

1. O ye children of 

2. I have likened the daughter of Zion to 

3. The shepherds with their flocks 

4. 
          

5. Arise, and let vs goe vp by night, and destroy her palaces.

6. For thus hath the Lord of hostes said, Hewe downe wood, and cast a mounte against Ierusalem: this citie must be visited: all oppression is in the middes of it.

7. As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: 

8. Be thou instructed, O 

9. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn 

10. To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear [is] 

11. Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: 

12. And their houses with their landes, & wiues also shalbe turned vnto strangers: for I will stretch out mine hande vpon the inhabitants of the land, sayeth the Lord.

13. For from the least of them, euen vnto the greatest of them, euery one is giuen vnto couetousnesse, and from the Prophet euen vnto the Priest, they all deale falsely.

14. They have healed also the hurt [of the daughter] of my people slightly, saying, 

15. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not ashamed, no neither coulde they haue any shame: therefore they shall fall among the slaine: when I shall visite them, they shall be cast downe, sayth the Lorde.

16. Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the 

17. Also I set 

18. Therefore hear, ye 

19. Heare, O earth, beholde, I will cause a plague to come vpon this people, euen the fruite of their owne imaginations: because they haue not taken heede vnto my woordes, nor to my Lawe, but cast it off.

20. To what purpose cometh there to me 

21. Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde, Beholde, I will laie stumbling blockes before this people, and the fathers and the sonnes together shall fall vpon them: the neighbour and his friende shall perish.

22. Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the 

23. With bowe and shield shal they be weaponed: they are cruell and will haue no compassion: their voyce roareth like the sea, and they ride vpon horses, well appointed, like men of warre against thee, O daughter Zion.

24. We have heard the report of it: our hands become 

25. Goe not foorth into the fielde, nor walke by the way: for the sword of the enemie and feare is on euery side.

26. O daughter of my people, girde thee with sackecloth, and wallowe thy selfe in the ashes: make lamentation, and bitter mourning as for thine onely sonne: for the destroier shall suddenly come vpon vs.

27. I have set 

28. They are all rebellious traitours, walking craftily: they are brasse, and yron, they all are destroyers.

29. The 

30. They shall call them reprobate siluer, because the Lord hath reiected them.

## Jeremiah 7

1. The woordes that came to Ieremiah from the Lorde, saying,

2. Stand in the gate of the Lordes house and crie this woorde there, and say, Heare the woorde of the Lord, all yee of Iudah that enter in at these gates to worship the Lorde.

3. Thus sayeth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Amend your waies and your woorkes, and I will let you dwell in this place.

4. Trust ye not in 

5. For if you amende and redresse your waies and your woorkes: if you execute iudgement betweene a man and his neighbour,

6. And oppresse not the stranger, the fatherlesse and the widow and shed no innocent blood in this place, neither walke after other gods to your destruction,

7. Then 

8. Beholde, you trust in lying woordes, that can not profite.

9. Will you steale, murder, and commit adulterie, and sweare falsely and burne incense vnto Baal, and walke after other gods whome yee knowe not?

10. And come and stande before mee in this House, whereupon my Name is called, and saye, We are deliuered, though we haue done all these abominations?

11. Is this house, which is called by my name, become 

12. But go ye now to my place which [was] in Shiloh, 

13. And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spoke to you, 

14. Therefore will I do vnto this House, wherupon my Name is called, wherein also yee trust, euen vnto the place that I gaue to you & to your fathers, as I haue done vnto Shilo.

15. And I will cast 

16. Therefore 

17. Seest thou not what they doe in the cities of Iudah and in the streetes of Ierusalem?

18. The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to 

19. Doe they prouoke me to anger, sayeth the Lorde, and not themselues to the confusion of their owne faces?

20. Therefore thus sayeth the Lorde God, Beholde, mine anger and my wrath shall be powred vpon this place, vpon man and vpon beast, and vpon the tree of the fielde, and vpon the fruite of the grounde, and it shall burne and not bee quenched.

21. Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Put your burnt offerings vnto your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.

22. For 

23. But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voyce, and I will be your God, and yee shalbe my people: and walke yee in all the wayes which I haue commaunded you, that it may be well vnto you.

24. But they would not obey, nor incline their eare, but went after the counsels and the stubbernesse of their wicked heart, and went backewarde and not forwarde.

25. Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to 

26. Yet would they not heare me nor encline their eare, but hardened their necke & did worse then their fathers.

27. Therefore thou shalt speak all these words to them; but they 

28. But thou shalt say vnto them, This is a nation that heareth not the voice of the Lorde their God, nor receiueth discipline: trueth is perished, and is cleane gone out of their mouth.

29. Cut off thy 

30. For the children of Iudah haue done euill in my sight, sayth the Lorde: they haue set their abominations in the House, whereupon my Name is called, to pollute it.

31. And they have built the high places of 

32. Therefore beholde, the dayes come, sayeth the Lord, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall burie in Topheth til there be no place.

33. And ye carkeises of this people shalbe meat for the foules of the heauen and for the beastes of the earth, and none shall fraie them away.

34. Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Iudah and from the streetes of Ierusalem the voice of mirth & the voice of gladnesse, the voice of the bridegrom & the voice of the bride: for the lande shalbe desolate.

## Jeremiah 8

1. At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their 

2. And they shal spread them before the sunne and the moone, and all the host of heauen, whom they haue loued, and whome they haue serued, and whome they haue followed, and whome they haue sought, and whome they haue worshipped: they shall not be gathered nor be buried, but shall be as doung vpon the earth.

3. And death shall be chosen 

4. Moreover thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they 

5. Wherefore is this people of Ierusalem turned backe by a perpetuall rebellion? they gaue themselues to deceit, and would not returne.

6. I hearkened and heard, [but] they spoke not aright: no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every 

7. Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the 

8. How do ye say, We [are] wise, and the law of the LORD [is] with us? Lo, certainly in vain he hath made [it]; 

9. The 

10. Therefore will I giue their wiues vnto others, and their fieldes to them that shall possesse them: for euery one from the least euen vnto the greatest is giuen to couetousnesse, and from the Prophet euen vnto the Priest, euery one dealeth falsely.

11. For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, 

12. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not ashamed, neither coulde they haue any shame: therefore shall they fall among the slaine: when I shall visite them, they shall be cast downe, sayeth the Lorde.

13. I wil surely consume them, sayth the Lord: there shalbe no grapes on the vine, nor figges on the figtree, and the leafe shall fade, and the things that I haue giuen them, shal depart from them.

14. Why do we sit still? 

15. We looked for peace, but no good came, & for a time of health, and behold troubles.

16. The snorting of his horses was heard from 

17. For, behold, I will 

18. [When] I would 

19. Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a distant country: [Is] not the LORD in Zion? [is] not her king in her? Why

1. O that my head were 

2. O that I had in the wilderness a 

3. And they bend their tongues [like] their bow [for] 

4. Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any 

5. And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they 

6. Thy habitation [is] in the midst of deceit; 

7. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will 

8. Their tongue is as an arow shot out, and speaketh deceite: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in his heart hee layeth waite for him.

9. Shal I not visit them for these things, saith the Lorde? Or shall not my soule be auenged on such a nation as this?

10. For the 

11. And I wil make Ierusalem an heape, and a den of dragons, & I will make the cities of Iudah waste, without an inhabitant.

12. Who [is] the 

13. And the Lorde sayeth, Because they haue forsaken my Lawe, which I set before them, and haue not obeyed my voice, neither walked thereafter,

14. But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which

16. I wil scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers haue knowen, and I will send a sworde after them, til I haue consumed them.

17. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for 

18. And let them make haste, & let them take vp a lamentation for vs, that our eyes may cast out teares & our eye liddes gush out of water.

19. For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we laid waste! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings 

20. Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and 

21. For death hath come up into our 

22. Speake, thus sayth the Lorde, The carkeises of men shall lye, euen as the doung vpon the fielde, and as the handfull after the mower, and none shal gather them.

23. Thus saith the LORD, Let not the 

24. But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] the LORD who 

25. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all [them who are] 

26. Egypt and Iudah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all the vtmost corners of them that dwell in the wildernesse: for all these nations are vncircumcised, & al the house of Israel are vncircumcised in the heart.

## Jeremiah 10

1. Heare ye the worde of the Lord that he speaketh vnto you, O house of Israel.

2. Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the 

3. For the 

4. They deck it 

5. The idoles stande vp as the palme tree, but speake not: they are borne because they cannot go feare them not, for they cannot do euill, neither can they do good.

6. Forasmuch as [there is] none like thee, O LORD; 

7. Who would not feare thee, O King of nations? For to thee appertaineth the dominion: for among all the wise men of the Gentiles, and in al their kingdomes there is none like thee.

8. But they are altogether senseless and foolish: the stock [is] a 

9. Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold 

10. But the Lord is the God of trueth: he is the liuing God, and an euerlasting King: at his anger the earth shal tremble, and the nations cannot abide his wrath.

11. Thus shall ye say to them, The gods 

12. He hath made the earth by his power, and established the worlde by his wisedome, and hath stretched out the heauen by his discretion.

13. Hee giueth by his voyce the multitude of waters in the heauen, and he causeth the cloudes to ascend from the endes of the earth: he turneth lightnings to rayne, and bringeth forth the winde out of his treasures.

14. Every man is 

15. They are vanitie, and the worke of errours: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

16. The

18. For thus sayth the Lorde, Beholde, at this time I will throwe as with a sling the inhabitants of the lande, and will trouble them, and they shal finde it so.

19. Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this

21. For the shepherds

## Jeremiah 11

1. The worde that came to Ieremiah from the Lord, saying,

2. Heare ye the wordes of this couenant, and speake vnto the men of Iudah, and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem,

3. And say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; 

4. Which I commaunded vnto your fathers, when I brought them out of the lande of Egypt, from the yron fornace, saying, Obey my voyce, and doe according to all these things, which I commande you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God,

5. That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it is] this day. Then answered 

6. Then the Lord saide vnto me, Cry all these words in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem, saying, Heare yee the words of this couenant, and doe them.

7. For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day [that] I brought them out of the land of Egypt, [even] to this day, 

8. Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their

10. They are turned backe to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to heare my wordes: and they went after other gods to serue them: thus the house of Israel, & the house of Iudah haue broken my couenant, which I made with their fathers.

11. Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, 

12. Then shall the cities of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem goe, and crie vnto the gods vnto whome they offer incense, but they shall not bee able to helpe them in time of their trouble.

1. Thus sayth the Lorde vnto mee, Goe, and buy thee a linen girdle, & put it vpon thy loynes, and put it not in water.

2. So I bought the girdle according to the commandement of the Lord, and put it vpon my loynes.

3. And the worde of the Lorde came vnto me the second time, saying,

4. Take the sash that thou hast bought, which [is] upon thy loins, and arise, go to

6. And after many dayes, the Lorde sayde vnto mee, Arise, goe towarde Perath, and take the girdle from thence, which I commaunded thee to hide there.

7. Then went I to Perath, and digged, & tooke the girdle from the place where I had hid it, and behold, the girdle was corrupt, and was profitable for nothing.

8. Then the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

9. Thus sayth the Lord, After this maner will I destroy the pride of Iudah, and the great pride of Ierusalem.

10. This wicked people haue refused to heare my word, and walke after ye stubbernesse of their owne heart, and walke after other gods to serue them, and to worship them: therefore they shalbe as this girdle, which is profitable to nothing.

11. For as the girdle cleaueth to the loynes of a man, so haue I tied to me the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Iudah, saith the Lorde, that they might bee my people: that they might haue a name and prayse, and glory, but they would not heare.

12. Therefore thou shalt speak to them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every

24. Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that is taken away with the South winde.

25. This is thy portion, and ye part of thy measures from me, sayth the Lorde, because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in lyes.

11. Then said the LORD to me, 

12. When they fast, I will not heare their cry, and when they offer burnt offering, and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sworde, and by the famine and by the pestilence.

13. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the

15. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Concerning the prophets that prophecie in my Name, whom I haue not sent, yet they say, Sworde and famine shal not be in this land, by sword and famine shal those prophets be consumed.

16. And the people to whome these prophets doe prophecie, shalbe cast out in the streetes of Ierusalem, because of the famine, & the sword, & there shall be none to bury them, both they, and their wiues, and their sonnes, and their daughters: for I wil powre their wickednes vpon them.

17. Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with

5. For thus saith the LORD, 

6. Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall [men] lament for them,

10. And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Why hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what [is]

6. In his dayes Iudah shalbe saued, and Israel shall dwell safely, and this is the Name wherby they shall call him, The Lorde our righteousnesse.

7. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The 

8. But the Lord liueth, which brought vp & led the seede of the house of Israel out of the North countrey and from all countryes where I had scattered them, and they shall dwell in their owne lande.

9. My heart within me is broken because of the 

10. For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their 

11. For both prophet and priest are profane; even, in my 

12. Wherefore their way shalbe vnto them as slipperie wayes in the darknesse: they shalbe driuen foorth and fall therein: for I will bring a plague vpon them, euen the yeere of their visitation, saith the Lorde.

13. And I haue seene foolishnesse in the prophets of Samaria, that prophecied in Baal, & caused my people Israel to erre.

14. I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem 

15. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with 

16. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own 

17. They say still to them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye 

18. For 

19. Beholde, the tempest of the Lorde goeth forth in his wrath, and a violent whirlewinde shal fall downe vpon the head of the wicked.

20. The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed, and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye 

21. I haue not sent these prophets, sayth the Lord, yet they ranne; I haue not spoken to them, and yet they prophecied.

22. But if they had stood in my counsel, and 

23. [Am] I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God 

24. Can any hide him selfe in secrete places, that I shall not see him, sayth the Lorde? Do not I fill heauen and earth, saieth the Lord?

25. I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I 

26. Howe long? Doe the prophets delite to prophecie lies, euen prophecying the deceit of their owne heart?

27. Who think to cause 

28. The prophet that hath a dream, let him 

29. Is not my word euen like a fire, sayeth the Lorde? and like an hammer, that breaketh the stone?

30. Therefore, behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that 

31. Behold, I [am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, 

32. Beholde, I will come against them that prophecie false dreames, saith the Lorde, and doe tell them, and cause my people to erre by their lies, and by their flatteries, and I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they bring no profite vnto this people, saith the Lord.

33. And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What [is] the 

34. And [as for] the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The 

35. Thus shall yee say euery one to his neighbour, and euerie one to his brother, What hath the Lorde answered? and what hath the Lorde spoken?

36. And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's 

37. Thus shalt thou say to the Prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and what hath the Lorde spoken?

38. And if you say, The burden of the Lorde, Then thus saith the Lorde, Because yee say this word, The burden of the Lorde, and I haue sent vnto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the Lorde,

39. Therefore beholde, I, euen I will vtterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the citie that I gaue you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence,

40. And will bring an euerlasting reproche vpon you, and a perpetual shame which shall neuer be forgotten.

## Jeremiah 24

1. The LORD showed me, and, behold, two 

2. One basket had verie good figges, euen like the figges that are first ripe: and the other basket had verie naughtie figges, which could not be eaten, they were so euill.

3. Then saide the Lorde vnto mee, What seest thou, Ieremiah? And I said, Figges: ye good figges verie good, & the naughtie verie naughtie, which cannot be eaten, they are so euill.

4. Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

5. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this 

6. For I wil set mine eyes vpon them for good, and I will bring them againe to this lande, and I will build them, and not destroy them, & I will plant them, and not roote them out,

7. And I will give them 

8. And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell 

9. I will euen giue them for a terrible plague to all the kingdomes of the earth, and for a reproche, and for a prouerbe, for a common talke, and for a curse, in all places where I shall cast them.

10. And I will sende the sworde, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till they bee consumed out of the land, that I gaue vnto them and to their fathers.

## Jeremiah 25

1. The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the 

2. The which Ieremiah the Prophet spake vnto all the people of Iudah, and to all the inhabitants of Ierusalem, saying,

3. From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to 

4. And the Lord hath sent vnto you all his seruantes the Prophets, rising early & sending them, but yee would not heare, nor encline your eares to obey.

5. They 

6. And go not after other gods to serue them and to worshippe them, and prouoke me not to anger with the workes of your hands, and I will not punish you.

7. Neuerthelesse ye would not heare me, saith the Lord, but haue prouoked mee to anger with the workes of your hands to your owne hurt.

8. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hostes, Because ye haue not heard my wordes,

9. Behold, I will send and take all the 

10. Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the 

11. And this whole land shalbe desolate, and an astonishment, and these nations shall serue the King of Babel seuentie yeeres.

12. And it shall come to pass, when 

13. And I will bring vpon that lande all my wordes which I haue pronounced against it, euen all that is written in this booke, which Ieremiah hath prophecied against all nations.

14. For many nations and great kings shall be 

15. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel to me; 

16. And they shall drinke, and be moued and be mad, because of the sworde that I will sende among them.

17. Then tooke I the cup at the Lordes hand, and made all people to drinke, vnto whome the Lorde had sent me:

18. [That is], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings, and her princes, to make them a desolation, an horror, an hissing, and a curse; 

19. Pharaoh also, King of Egypt, and his seruants, and his princes, and all his people:

20. And all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land 

21. 
          

22. And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the 

23. 
          

24. And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people that dwell in the 

25. And all the Kings of Zimri, and all the Kings of Elam, and all the Kings of the Medes,

26. And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which [are] upon the face of the earth: and the king of 

27. Therefore say thou vnto them, Thus saith the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Drinke and bee drunken, and spewe and fall, and rise no more, because of the sworde, which I will sende among you.

28. But if they refuse to take the cuppe at thine hande to drinke, then tell them, Thus saith the Lorde of hostes, Ye shall certainely drinke.

29. For, lo, 

30. Therefore prophecie thou against them al these words, and say vnto them, The Lord shall roare from aboue, and thrust out his voyce from his holy habitation: he shall roare vpon his habitation, and crie aloude, as they that presse the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.

31. The sounde shall come to the endes of the earth: for the Lord hath a controuersie with the nations, and will enter into iudgement with all flesh, and he will giue them that are wicked, to the sworde, saith the Lord.

32. Thus saith the Lorde of hostes, Behold, a plague shall goe foorth from nation to nation, and a great whirlewinde shalbe raised vp from the coastes of the earth,

33. And 

34. Howl, 

35. And the 

36. A voyce of the crye of the shepherdes, and an howling of the principall of the flocke shalbe heard: for the Lord hath destroyed their pasture.

37. And the best pastures are destroyed because of the wrath and indignation of the Lorde.

38. He hath forsaken his couert, as the lyon: for their land is waste, because of the wrath of the oppressor, & because of ye wrath of his indignatio.

## Jeremiah 26

1. In the beginning of the reigne of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah King of Iudah, came this worde from the Lorde, saying,

2. Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the 

3. It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may 

4. And thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord, If ye will not heare me to walke in my Lawes, which I haue set before you,

5. And to heare ye wordes of my seruants the Prophets, whome I sent vnto you, both rising vp earely, and sending them, and will not obey them,

6. Then will I make this house like 

7. So the Priestes, and the Prophets, and all the people heard Ieremiah speaking these wordes in the House of the Lorde.

8. Nowe when Ieremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speake vnto all the people, then the Priestes, and the prophets, and all the people tooke him, and saide, Thou shalt die the death.

9. Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 

10. When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the 

11. Then spake the Priestes, and the prophets vnto the princes, and to all the people, saying, This man is worthie to die: for he hath prophecied against this citie, as ye haue heard with your eares.

12. Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD 

13. Therefore nowe amende your wayes and your workes, and heare the voyce of the Lorde your God, that the Lorde may repent him of the plague, that he hath pronounced against you.

14. As for me, beholde, I am in your hands: do with me as ye thinke good and right.

15. But knowe ye for certaine, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood vpon your selues, and vpon this citie, and vpon the inhabitants thereof: for of a trueth the Lord hath sent me vnto you, to speake all these words in your eares.

16. Then saide the princes and all the people vnto the Priestes, and to the prophets, This man is not worthie to die: for he hath spoken vnto vs in the Name of the Lorde our God.

17. Then rose vp certaine of the Elders of the lande, and spake to all the assemblie of the people, saying,

18. Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the 

19. Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the 

20. And there was also a man that prophecied in the Name of the Lord, one Vriiah the sonne of Shemaiah, of Kiriath-iarem, who prophecied against this citie, and against this lande, according to all the wordes of Ieremiah.

21. Nowe when Iehoiakim the King with all his men of power, and all the princes heard his wordes, the King sought to slay him. But when Vriiah heard it, he was afraide and fled, and went into Egypt.

22. And Jehoiakim the king

1. In the beginning of the reign of 

2. Thus saith the LORD to me; Make for thee 

3. And send them to the King of Edom, and to the King of Moab, & to the King of the Ammonites, and to the King of Tyrus, & to the king of Zidon, by the hande of the messengers which come to Ierusale vnto Zedekiah ye king of Iudah,

4. And commande them to saye vnto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say vnto your masters,

5. I haue made the earth, the ma, and the beast that are vpon the groud, by my great power, and by my outstreched arme, and haue giuen it vnto whom it pleased me.

6. And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my 

7. And all nations shall serve him, and his 

8. And the nation and kingdome which will not serue the same Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babel, and that will not put their necke vnder the yoke of the King of Babel, the same nation will I visite, saith the Lord, with the sworde, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, vntill I haue wholy giuen them into his hands.

9. Therefore heare not your prophets nor your southsayers, nor your dreamers, nor your inchanters, nor your sorcerers, which say vnto you thus, Ye shall not serue the King of Babel.

10. For they prophecie a lie vnto you to cause you to goe farre from your lande, and that I should cast you out, and you should perish.

11. But the nation that put their neckes vnder the yoke of the King of Babel, & serue him, those wil I let remaine stil in their owne land, saith the Lord, and they shall occupie it, and dwel therein.

12. I spake also to Zedekiah king of Iudah according to all these wordes, saying, Put your neckes vnder the yoke of the King of Babel, and serue him and his people, that ye may liue.

13. Why will ye dye, thou, and thy people by the sworde, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lorde hath spoken against the nation, that will not serue the King of Babel?

14. Therefore heare not the words of the prophets, that speake vnto you, saying, Ye shall not serue the King of Babel: for they prophecie a lie vnto you.

15. For I haue not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophecie a lie in my name, that I might cast you out, and that ye might perish, both you, and the prophets that prophecie vnto you.

16. Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be 

17. Heare them not, but serue the King of Babel, that ye may liue: wherefore shoulde this citie be desolate?

18. But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now 

19. For thus saith the Lord of hostes, concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remaine in this citie,

20. Which Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel tooke not, when he caryed away captiue Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim King of Iudah from Ierusalem to Babel, with all the nobles of Iudah and Ierusalem.

21. For thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remaine in the House of the Lorde, and in the house of the King of Iudah, and at Ierusalem,

22. They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit 

## Jeremiah 28

1. And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the 

2. Thus speaketh the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel, saying, I haue broken the yoke of the King of Babel.

3. Within two yeeres space I will bring into this place all the vessels of the Lords House, that Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel tooke away from this place, and caried them into Babel.

4. And I will bring againe to this place Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim King of Iudah, with all them that were caried away captiue of Iudah, and went into Babel, saith the Lorde: for I will breake the yoke of the King of Babel.

5. Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the 

6. Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the 

7. But heare thou now this worde that I will speake in thine eares and in the eares of all the people.

8. The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old 

9. And the Prophet which prophecieth of peace, when the word of the Prophet shall come to passe, then shall the Prophet be knowen that the Lorde hath truely sent him.

10. Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and 

11. And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lorde, Euen so will I breake the yoke of Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, from the necke of al nations within the space of two yeres: and the Prophet Ieremiah went his way.

12. Then the word of the Lorde came vnto Ieremiah the Prophet, (after that Hananiah the Prophet had broken the yoke from the necke of the Prophet Ieremiah) saying,

13. Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus sayth the Lord, Thou hast broken the yokes of wood, but thou shalt make for them yokes of yron.

14. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a

7. And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and 

8. For thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, Let not your prophets, and your southsayers that bee among you, deceiue you, neither giue eare to your dreames, which you dreame.

9. For they prophecie you a lie in my Name: I haue not sent them, saith the Lorde.

10. But thus saith the Lorde, That after seuentie yeeres be accomplished at Babel, I will visite you, and performe my good promes toward you, and cause you to returne to this place.

11. For I knowe the thoughtes, that I haue thought towards you, saith the Lorde, euen the thoughtes of peace, and not of trouble, to giue you an ende, and your hope.

12. Then shall you crie vnto mee, and ye shal go and pray vnto me, and I will heare you,

13. And ye shall seek me, and find [me], when ye shall search for me with all 

14. And I wil be found of you, saith the Lord, and I will turne away your captiuitie, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places, whither I haue cast you, saith the Lord, and will bring you againe vnto the place, whence I caused you to be caryed away captiue.

15. Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised up for us 

16. Therefore thus saith the Lorde of the King, that sitteth vpon the throne of Dauid, and of all the people, that dwell in this citie, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captiuitie:

17. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the

20. Heare ye therefore the word of the Lord all ye of the captiuitie, whome I haue sent from Ierusalem to Babel.

21. Thus saith the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel, of Ahab the sonne of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the sonne of Maaseiah, which prophecie lyes vnto you in my Name, Beholde, I will deliuer them into the hande of Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, and he shall slay them before your eyes.

22. And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who [are] in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted 

23. Because they have committed 

24. Thou shalt also speake to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

29. And Zephaniah the Priest red this letter in the eares of Ieremiah the Prophet.

30. Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto Ieremiah, saying,

4. Againe, these are the wordes that the Lord spake concerning Israel, and concerning Iudah.

5. For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a

15. Why cryest thou for thine affliction? thy sorowe is incurable, for the multitude of thine iniquities: because thy sinnes were increased, I haue done these things vnto thee.

16. Therefore all they that deuoure thee, shal be deuoured, & all thine enemies euery one shall goe into captiuitie: and they that spoyle thee, shalbe spoyled, and all they that robbe thee, wil I giue to be robbed.

38. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the

40. And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, & all the fields vnto the brooke of Kidron, and vnto the corner of the horsegate toward the East, shalbe holy vnto the Lorde, neither shal it be plucked vp nor destroyed any more for euer.

## Jeremiah 32

1. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the 

2. For then the King of Babels hoste besieged Ierusalem: And Ieremiah the Prophet was shutte vp in the court of the prison, which was in the King of Iudahs house.

3. For Zedekiah King of Iudah had shut him vp, saying, Wherefore doest thou prophesie, and say, Thus saith the Lord, Beholde, I will giue this citie into the handes of the King of Babel, and he shall take it?

4. And Zedekiah the King of Iudah shall not escape out of the hande of the Caldeans, but shall surely be deliuered into the handes of the King of Babel, and shal speake with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall beholde his face,

5. And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until 

6. And Ieremiah said, The word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,

7. Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thy uncle shall come to thee, saying, 

8. So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my 

9. And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that [was] in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, [even] seventeen 

10. And I writ it in the booke and signed it, and tooke witnesses, and weighed him the siluer in the balances.

11. So I took the deed of the purchase, [both] that which was sealed 

12. And I gaue the booke of the possession vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, the sonne of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine vncles sonne, and in the presence of the witnesses, written in the booke of the possession, before al the Iewes that sate in the court of the prison.

13. And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

14. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is open; and put them in an earthen 

15. For the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel saith thus, Houses and fieldes, and vineyardes shall be possessed againe in this land.

16. Now when I had deliuered the booke of the possession vnto Baruch, the sonne of Neriah, I prayed vnto the Lord, saying,

17. Ah Lord God, beholde, thou hast made the heauen and the earth by thy great power, and by thy stretched out arme, & there is nothing hard vnto thee.

18. Thou shewest lovingkindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their 

19. Great in counsell, & mightie in worke, (for thine eyes are open vpon all the wayes of ye sonnes of men, to giue to euery one according to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his workes)

20. 
          

21. And hast brought thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signes, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, with a stretched out arme, and with great terrour,

22. And hast giuen them this land, which thou diddest sweare to their fathers to giue them, euen a land, that floweth with milke and hony,

23. And they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voyce, neither walked in thy Law: all that thou commaundedst them to doe, they haue not done: therefore thou hast caused this whole plague to come vpon them.

24. Behold the 

25. And thou hast sayd vnto me, O Lord God, Bye vnto thee the fielde for siluer, and take witnesses: for the citie shall be giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.

26. Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying,

27. Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all 

28. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Beholde, I wil giue this citie into the hand of the Caldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchad-nezzar, King of Babel, and he shall take it.

29. And the Caldeans shall come and fight against this citie, and set fire on this citie and burne it, with the houses, vpon whose rouses they haue offred incense vnto Baal, and powred drinke offrings vnto other gods, to prouoke me vnto anger.

30. For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only before me from their 

31. Therefore this citie hath bene vnto me as a prouocation of mine anger, and of my wrath, from the day, that they built it, euen vnto this day, that I should remoue it out of my sight,

32. Because of all the euill of the children of Israel, and of the children of Iudah, which they haue done to prouoke mee to anger, euen they, their Kings, their Princes, their Priests, and their Prophets, and the men of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem.

33. And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, 

34. But they set their abominations in ye house (whereupon my Name was called) to defile it,

35. And they built the high 

36. And now 

37. Beholde, I will gather them out of all countreys, wherein I haue scattered them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation, and I wil bring them againe vnto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.

38. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

39. And I will give them 

40. And I will make an everlasting 

41. Yea, I wil delite in them to do them good, and I wil plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart, and with all my soule.

42. For thus sayth the Lorde, Like as I haue brought all this great plague vpon this people, so wil I bring vpon them all the good that I haue promised them.

43. And the fields shalbe possessed in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without ma or beast, and shalbe giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.

1. Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the

3. Call vnto me, and I will answere thee, and shewe thee great and mightie things, which thou knowest not.

4. For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the

11. The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, 

12. Thus sayth the Lorde of hostes, Againe in this place, which is desolate, without man, & without beast, and in all the cities thereof there shall be dwelling for shepheards to rest their flockes.

13. In the cities of the 

14. Beholde, the dayes come, sayth the Lorde, that I wil performe that good thing, which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel, & to the house of Iudah.

15. In those days, and at that time, will I cause 

16. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this [is the name] by which 

17. For thus sayth the Lord, Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne of the house of Israel.

18. Neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer 

19. And the worde of the Lorde came vnto Ieremiah, saying,

20. Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the 

21. Then may my couenant be broken with Dauid my seruant, that he should not haue a sonne to reigne vpon his throne, and with the Leuites, and Priests my ministers.

22. As the army of heauen can not be nombred, neither the sand of the sea measured: so wil I multiplie the seede of Dauid my seruant, and the Leuites, that minister vnto me.

23. Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came to Ieremiah, saying,

24. Considerest thou not what 

25. Thus sayth the Lorde, If my couenant be not with day and night, and if I haue not appointed the order of heauen and earth,

26. Then will I cast away the seede of Iaakob and Dauid my seruant, and not take of his seede to be rulers ouer the seede of Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob: for I wil cause their captiuitie to returne, and haue compassion on them.

## Jeremiah 34

1. The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when 

2. Thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel, Goe, and speake to Zedekiah King of Iudah, and tell him, Thus sayth the Lord, Beholde, I will giue this citie into the hand of the King of Babel, and he shall burne it with fire,

3. And thou shall not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and deliuered into his hand, and thine eyes shal beholde the face of the King of Babel, & he shal speake with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babel.

4. Yet heare the worde of the Lord, O Zedekiah, King of Iudah: thus sayth the Lord of thee, Thou shalt not dye by the sword,

5. [But] thou shalt die in 

6. Then Ieremiah the Prophet spake all these words vnto Zedekiah King of Iudah in Ierusalem,

7. (When the King of Babels hoste fought against Ierusalem, and against all the cities of Iudah, that were left, euen against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these strong cities remained of the cities of Iudah)

8. [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who [were] at Jerusalem, 

9. That every man should release his male 

10. Now when all the princes, and all the people which had agreed to the couenant, heard that euery one should let his seruant go free, & euery one his handmaide, and that none should serue them selues of them any more, they obeyed and let them go.

11. But afterwarde they repented and caused the seruants and the handmayds, whom they had let go free, to returne, and helde them in subiection as seruants and handmayds.

12. Therefore the worde of the Lorde came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord, saying,

13. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I made a couenant with your fathers, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of seruants, saying,

14. At the terme of seuen yeres let ye go, euery man his brother an Ebrewe which hath bene solde vnto thee: and when he hath serued the sixe yeres, thou shalt let him go free fro thee: but your fathers obeyed me not, neither inclined their eares.

15. And ye had now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in 

16. But ye repented, and polluted my Name: for ye haue caused euery man his seruant, and euery man his handmayde, whom ye had set at libertie at their pleasure, to returne, and holde them in subiection to bee vnto you as seruantes and as handmaydes.

17. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to 

18. And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they

20. I wil euen giue them into the hand of their enemies, and into the handes of them that seeke their life: and their dead bodies shalbe for meate vnto the foules of the heauen, and to the beastes of the earth.

21. And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which 

22. Beholde, I will commande, saith the Lord, and cause them to returne to this citie, and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burne it with fire: and I will make the cities of Iudah desolate without an inhabitant.

## Jeremiah 35

2. Go to the house of the 

3. Then tooke I Iaazaniah, the sonne of Ieremiah the sonne of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sonnes, and the whole house of the Rechabites,

4. And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man 

5. And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I 

6. But they said, We will drink no wine: for 

7. Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seede, nor plant vineyarde, nor haue any, but all your dayes ye shall dwell in tentes, that ye may liue a long time in the land where ye be strangers.

8. Thus haue wee obeyed the voyce of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father, in all that he hath charged vs, and wee drinke no wine all our dayes, neither wee, our wiues, our sonnes, nor our daughters.

9. Neither builde wee houses for vs to dwell in, neither haue we vineyard, nor fielde, nor seede,

10. But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to

13. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will 

14. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: however I have spoken to you, 

15. I haue sent also vnto you all my seruants the Prophetes, rising vp earely, and sending, them, saying, Returne nowe euery man from his euill way, and amende your workes, and goe not after other gods to serue them, and ye shall dwel in the lande which I haue giuen vnto you, and to your fathers, but ye would not encline your eare, nor obey mee.

16. Surely the sonnes of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab, haue kept the commaundement of their father, which he gaue them, but this people hath not obeyed me.

17. Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have 

18. And Ieremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the Lorde of hostes the God of Israel, Because ye haue obeyed the commandement of Ionadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according vnto all that hee hath commaunded you,

2. Take thee a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to thee, 

3. It may bee that the House of Iudah will heare of all the euill, which I determined to doe vnto them that they may returne euery man from his euil way, that I may forgiue their iniquitie and their sinnes.

4. Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote 

5. And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I [am] 

6. Therefore go thou, and read in the scroll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the

8. So Baruch the sonne of Neriah did according vnto all, that Ieremiah the Prophet commanded him, reading in the booke the wordes of the Lord in the Lords House.

9. And it came to pass in the fifth 

10. Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance of the 

11. When Michaiah the sonne of Gemariah, the sonne of Shaphan had heard out of the booke all the wordes of the Lord,

12. Then hee went downe to the Kings house into the Chancellours chamber, and loe, all the princes sate there, euen Elishama the Chancellour, and Delaiah the sonne of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, and Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the sonne of Hananiah, and all the princes.

13. Then Michaiah declared vnto them all the wordes that he had heard when Baruch read in the booke in the audience of the people.

14. Therefore all the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nethaniah, the sonne of Shelemiah, the sonne of Chushi, vnto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hande the roule, wherein thou hast read in the audience of the people, and come. So Baruch the sonne of Neriah, tooke the roule in his hand, and came vnto them.

15. And they saide vnto him, Sit downe now, and reade it, that we may heare. So Baruch read it in their audience.

16. Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were 

17. And they examined Baruch, saying, Tell vs nowe, howe diddest thou write all these wordes at his mouth?

18. Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these wordes vnto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ynke in the booke.

19. Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, 

20. And they went in to the King to the court, but they layde vp the roule in the chamber of Elishama the Chancellour and tolde the King all the wordes, that he might heare.

21. So the King sent Iehudi to fet the roule, and he tooke it out of Elishama the Chancellours chamber, and Iehudi read it in the audience of the King, and in the audience of all the princes, which stoode beside the King.

22. Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the

24. Yet they were not afraid, nor tore 

25. Neuerthelesse, Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah had besought the King, that he would not burne ye roule: but he would not heare them.

26. But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD 

27. Then the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah (after that the King had burnt the roule and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremiah) saying,

28. Take thee again 

29. And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this scroll, saying, 

30. Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have 

31. And I will visite him and his seede, and his seruants for their iniquitie, and I will bring vpon them, and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and vpo the men of Iudah all the euil that I haue pronounced against them: but they would not heare.

32. Then tooke Ieremiah another roule, and gaue it Baruch the scribe the sonne of Neriah, which wrote therein at the mouth of Ieremiah all the wordes of the booke which Iehoiakim King of Iudah had burnt in the fire, and there were added besides them many like wordes.

8. And the Caldeans shall come againe, and fight against this citie, and take it and burne it with fire.

9. Thus sayth the Lorde, Deceiue not your selues, saying, The Caldeans shall surely depart from vs: for they shal not depart.

10. For though ye had smitten the whole hoste of the Caldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should euery man rise vp in his tent, and burne this citie with fire.

11. When the hoste of the Caldeans was broken vp from Ierusalem, because of Pharaohs armie,

12. Then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the

18. Moreouer, Ieremiah sayd vnto King Zedekiah, What haue I offended against thee, or against thy seruants, or against this people, that ye haue put me in prison?

19. Where are nowe your prophets, which prophecied vnto you, saying, The King of Babel shall not come against you, nor against this land?

20. Therefore heare nowe, I pray thee, O my lorde the King: let my prayer be accepted before thee, that thou cause mee not to returne to the house of Iehonathan the scribe, least I die there.

11. So Ebed-melech tooke the men with him and went to the house of the King vnder the treasurie, and tooke there olde rotten ragges, and olde worne cloutes, and let them downe by coards into the dungeon to Ieremiah.

12. And Ebed-melech the blacke More sayde vnto Ieremiah, Put now these olde rotten ragges and worne, vnder thine arme holes, betweene the coards; Ieremiah did so.

13. So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the

15. Then Ieremiah sayd to Zedekiah, If I declare it vnto thee, wilt not thou slay me? and if I giue thee counsell, thou wilt not heare me.

16. So the King sware secretly vnto Ieremiah, saying, As the Lorde liueth that made vs these soules, I will not slay thee, nor giue thee into the hands of those men that seeke thy life.

17. Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's 

18. But if thou wilt not go forth to the King of Babels princes, then shall this citie be giuen into the hand of ye Caldeans, & they shal burne it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hands.

19. And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they

24. Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.

25. But if ye princes vnderstand that I haue talked with thee, & they come vnto thee, & say vnto thee, Declare vnto vs nowe, what thou hast sayde vnto the King, hide it not from vs, & we will not slay thee: also what the King sayd vnto thee,

5. For yet he was not returned: therefore he said, Returne to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, the sonne of Shaphan, whom the King of Babel hath made gouernour ouer all the cities of Iudah, and dwell with him among the people, or goe wheresoeuer it pleaseth thee to goe. So the chiefe stewarde gaue him vitailes and a rewarde, and let him goe.

8. But tenne men were founde among them, that saide vnto Ishmael, Slay vs not: for we haue treasures in the fielde, of wheate, and of barley, and of oyle, and of honie: so he stayed, and slew them not among their brethren.

4. Yet I sent to you all my servants the prophets, 

5. But they would not heare nor incline their eare to turne from their wickednes, and to burne no more incense vnto other gods.

6. Wherefore 

7. Therefore now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, Wherfore commit ye this great euill against your soules, to cut off from you man and woman, childe and suckling out of Iudah, and leaue you none to remaine?

8. In that yee prouoke mee vnto wrath with the woorkes of your hands, burning incense vnto other Gods in the lande of Egypt whither yee be gone to dwell: that yee might bring destruction vnto your selues, and that ye might be a curse and a reproch among all nations of the earth.

9. Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the

22. So that the Lord could no longer forbeare, because of the wickednes of your inuentions, and because of the abominations, which ye haue committed: therefore is your lande desolate and an astonishment, and a curse and without inhabitant, as appeareth this day.

23. Because ye haue burnt incense and because ye haue sinned against the Lorde, and haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde, nor walked in his Lawe, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies, therefore this plague is come vpon you, as appeareth this day.

4. In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall 

5. They shal aske the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let vs cleaue to the Lorde in a perpetuall couenant that shall not be forgotten.

6. My people have been lost sheep: their 

7. All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, 

8. 
          

9. For loe, I will raise, and cause to come vp against Babel a multitude of mightie natios from the North countrey, and they shall set themselues in aray against her, whereby shee shall be taken: their arrowes shall be as of a strong man, which is expert, for none shall returne in vaine.

10. And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that spoil her 

11. Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of my heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, 

12. Therefore your mother shall bee sore confounded, and she that bare you, shall be ashamed: beholde, the vttermost of the nations shalbe a desert, a drie land, and a wildernes.

13. Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, 

14. 
          

15. Crie against her round about: she hath giuen her hand: her foundations are fallen, and her walles are destroyed: for it is the vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance vpon her: as she hath done, doe vnto her.

16. Cut off the 

17. Israel [is] a scattered sheep; the lions have driven [him] away: first the king of 

18. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, Behold, I wil visit ye King of Babel, and his land, as I haue visited the King of Asshur.

19. And I will bring Israel againe to his habitation: hee shall feede on Carmel and Bashan, and his soule shall be satisfied vpon the mount Ephraim and Gilead.

20. In those daies, and at that time, sayeth the Lorde, the iniquitie of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none: and the sinnes of Iudah, and they shall not be founde: for I will be mercifull vnto them, whome I reserue.

21. Go up against the land of 

22. A crie of battell is in the land, and of great destruction.

23. How is the 

24. I haue snared thee, and thou art taken, O Babel, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striuen against the Lorde.

25. The Lord hath opened his treasure, & hath brought foorth the weapons of his wrath: for this is the woorke of the Lorde God of hostes in the lande of the Caldeans.

26. Come against her from the vtmost border: open her store houses: treade on her as on sheaues, and destroy her vtterly: let nothing of her be left.

27. Slay all her 

28. The voice of them that 

29. Call vp the archers against Babel: al ye that bend the bow, besiege it rounde about: let none thereof escape: recompence her according to her worke, & according to all that she hath done, doe vnto her: for she hath bene proud against the Lord, euen against the holy one of Israel.

30. Therefore shall her yong men fall in the streetes, and al her men of warre shalbe destroied in that day, sayeth the Lord.

31. Beholde, I come vnto thee, O proude man, saith the Lord God of hostes: for thy day is come, euen the time that I will visite thee.

32. And the proude shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him vp: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, & it shall deuoure all round about him.

33. Thus saieth the Lord of hosts, The children of Israel, and the children of Iudah were oppressed together: and all that tooke them captiues, held them, and would not let them goe.

34. Their Redeemer [is] strong; the LORD of hosts [is] his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, 

35. A sworde is vpon the Caldeans, sayeth the Lord, and vpon the inhabitants of Babel, and vpon her princes, and vpon her wise men.

36. A sworde is vpon the soothsaiers, and they shall dote: a sword is vpon her strong men, & they shalbe afraide.

37. A sworde is vpon their horses & vpon their charets, and vpon all the multitude that are in the middes of her, and they shall be like women: a sworde is vpon her treasures, and they shall be spoyled.

38. A 

39. Therefore the 

40. As God destroied Sodom and Gomorah with the places thereof neere about, sayeth the Lord: so shal no man dwell theere, neither shal the sonne of man remaine therein.

41. Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from 

42. They shall holde the bowe and the buckeler: they are cruell and vnmercifull: their voyce shall roare like the sea, and they shall ride vpon horses, and be put in aray like men to the battell against thee, O daughter of Babel.

43. The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands 

44. Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who [is] a chosen [man, that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that 

45. Therefore heare the counsell of the Lorde that hee hath deuised against Babel, and his purpose that hee hath conceiued against the lande of the Caldeans: surely the least of the flocke shall drawe them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.

46. At the noyse of the winning of Babel the earth is moued, and the crye is heard among the nations.

## Jeremiah 51

1. Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise against me, a destroying 

2. And wil send vnto Babel fanners that shal fanne her, & shal empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shalbe against her on euery side.

3. Also to the bender that bendeth his bowe, and to him that lifteth himselfe vp in his brigandine, will I say, Spare not her yong men, but destroy all her hoste.

4. Thus the slaine shal fall in the lande of the Caldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streetes.

5. For Israel [hath] not [been] 

6. 
          

7. Babylon [hath been] a golden cup in the

9. We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let 

10. The LORD hath brought forth our 

11. Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his purpose [is] against Babylon, to destroy it; because it [is] the vengeance of the LORD, the 

12. Set vp the standart vpon the walles of Babel, make the watch strong: set vp the watchmen: prepare the skoutes: for the Lord hath both deuised, and done that which he spake against the inhabitantes of Babel.

13. O thou that dwellest upon many 

14. The Lord of hostes hath sworne by him selfe, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers, and they shall cry and shoute against thee.

15. He hath made the earth by his power, & established the world by his wisedome, and hath stretched out the heauen by his discretion.

16. Hee giueth by his voyce the multitude of waters in the heauen, and he causeth the cloudes to ascend from the endes of the earth: he turneth lightnings to raine, and bringeth forth the winde out of his treasures.

17. Every man is senseless by [his] 

18. They [are] vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their 

19. The 

20. Thou [art] my 

21. And by thee wil I breake horse and horseman, and by thee will I breake the charet & him that rideth therein.

22. By thee also will I breake man & woman, and by thee wil I breake olde & yong, & by thee wil I breake the yong man and the mayde.

23. I wil also breake by thee the shepheard & his flocke, and by thee will I breake the husband man & his yoke of oxen, & by thee will I breake the dukes and princes.

24. And I will render vnto Babel, and to all the inhabitants of the Caldeans all their euil, that they haue done in Zion, euen in your sight, sayth the Lorde.

25. Behold, I [am] against thee, O destroying 

26. They shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for euer, sayth the Lord.

27. Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of 

28. Prepare against her the nations with the Kings of the Medes, the dukes thereof, and the princes thereof, & all the land of his dominion.

29. And the land shall tremble and sorow: for the deuise of the Lorde shalbe performed against Babel, to make the lande of Babel waste without an inhabitant.

30. The strong men of Babel haue ceased to fight: they haue remayned in their holdes: their strength hath fayled, and they were like women: they haue burnt her dwelling places, and her barres are broken.

31. One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at 

32. And that the passages are stopped, and the reedes burnt with fire, & the me of war troubled.

33. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshingfloor, [it is] time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest 

34. Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath 

35. The spoyle of me, and that which was left of me, is brought vnto Babel, shall the inhabitant of Zion say: and my blood vnto the inhabitantes of Caldea, shal Ierusalem say.

36. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy 

37. And Babel shall be as heapes, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, & an hissing, without an inhabitant.

38. They shal rore together like lions, and yell as the lyons whelpes.

39. In their 

40. I wil bring them downe like lambes to the slaughter, and like rams and goates.

41. How is 

42. The 

43. Her cities are desolate: the land is dry and a wildernes, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth the sonne of man passe thereby.

44. And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which 

45. My people, go out of the middes of her, & deliuer yee euery man his soule from the fierce wrath of the Lord,

46. And lest your heart should faint, and ye should fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come [one] 

47. Therefore beholde, the dayes come, that I will visite the images of Babel, & the whole land shalbe confounded, and all her slayne shal fall in the middes of her.

53. Though Babylon should mount up to 

54. A sound of a cry commeth from Babel, and great destruction from the land of the Caldeans,

55. Because the Lorde hath layde Babel waste and destroyed from her the great voyce, and her waues shall roare like great waters, and a sounde was made by their noyse:

56. Because the destroyer is come vpon her, euen vpon Babel, and her strong men are taken, their bowes are broken: for the Lorde God that recompenceth, shal surely recompence.

61. And Ieremiah sayd to Sheraiah, Whe thou commest vnto Babel, and shalt see, & shalt reade all these wordes,

62. Then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to destroy it, that none should remaine in it, neither man nor beast, but that it should be desolate for euer.

63. And it shall be, when thou hast finished reading this book, [that] thou shalt bind a

1. Zedekiah was one and twentie yeere olde when he began to reigne, and he reigned eleuen yeeres in Ierusalem, & his mothers name was Hamutal, the daughter of Ieremiah of Libnah.

2. And he did euil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Iehoiakim had done.

3. 
          

4. But in the ninth yeere of his reigne, in the tenth moneth the tenth day of the moneth came Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, he and all his hoste against Ierusalem, and pitched against it, & buylt fortes against it round about.

5. So the citie was besieged vnto the eleuenth yeere of the King Zedekiah.

6. Now in the fourth moneth, the ninth day of the moneth, the famine was sore in ye citie, so that there was no more bread for ye people of the land.

7. Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth from the city by night by the 

8. But the army of the Caldeans pursued after the king, and tooke Zedekiah in the desert of Iericho, and all his host was scattered from him.

9. Then they took the king, and carried him to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; 

10. And the king of Babel slewe the sonnes of Zedekiah, before his eyes he slew also al ye princes of Iudah in Riblah.

11. Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and the king of Babel bound him in chaines, and caried him to Babel, and put him in pryson till the day of his death.

12. Now in the fifth month, in the 

13. And burnt the House of the Lord, and the Kings house, and all the houses of Ierusalem, and all the great houses burnt he with fire.

14. And al the armie of the Caldeans that were with the chiefe steward, brake downe all ye walles of Ierusalem round about.

15. Then Nebuzar-adan the chiefe steward caried away captiue certaine of the poore of the people, and the residue of the people that remayned in the citie, and those that were fled, and fallen to the king of Babel, with the rest of the multitude.

16. But Nebuzar-adan the chiefe steward left certaine of the poore of the lande, to dresse the vines, and to till the land.

17. Also the 

18. The caldrons also, and the 

19. And the bowles, and the ashpannes, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlestickes, and the incense dishes, and the cuppes, and all that was of golde, and that was of siluer, tooke the chiefe steward away,

20. The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that [were] under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without 

21. And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteene cubites, and a threede of twelue cubites did compasse it, and the thickenes thereof was foure fingers: it was holowe.

22. And a chapiter of brasse was vpon it, and the height of one chapiter was fiue cubites with networke, and pomegranates vpon the chapiters round about, all of brasse: the seconde pillar also, and the pomegranates were like vnto these.

23. And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; [and] all the pomegranates upon the network [were] an

27. And the king of Babel smote them, and slewe them in Riblah, in the lande of Hamath: thus Iudah was caried away captiue out of his owne land.

28. This [is] the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the

30. In the three and twentieth yeere of Nebuchad-nezzar, Nebuzar-adan the chiefe stewarde caried away captiue of the Iewes seuen hundreth fourtie and fiue persons: all the persons were foure thousand and sixe hundreth.

31. And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the [first] year of his reign
