1. Paul,

4. 
          

5. That in every thing ye are enriched by him, 

6. 
          

7. So that ye come behind in no gift; 

8. 
          

9. God [is]

12. Now 

13. 
          

14. 
          

15. Lest any should say, that I had baptized into mine owne name.

16. I baptized also the houshold of Stephanas: furthermore knowe I not, whether I baptized any other.

17. 
          

18. For the

20. Where [is] the wise? where [is] the 

21. 
          

22. 
          

23. But wee preach Christ crucified: vnto the Iewes, euen a stumbling blocke, and vnto the Grecians, foolishnesse:

24. But vnto them which are called, both of the Iewes and Grecians, we preach Christ, the power of God, and the wisedome of God.

25. For the foolishnesse of God is wiser then men, and the weakenesse of God is stronger then men.

26. 
          

27. But God hath chosen the foolish thinges of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weake thinges of the worlde, to confound the mightie things,

28. And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea], and things which

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And 

2. I have fed you with milk, and not with 

3. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as 

4. For when one sayeth, I am Pauls, and another, I am Apollos, are yee not carnall?

5. 
          

6. 
          

7. So then, neither is hee that planteth any thing, neither hee that watreth, but God that giueth the increase.

8. And he that planteth, and he that watreth, are one, and euery man shall receiue his wages, according to his labour.

9. For we are 

10. According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. 

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. If any mans worke, that he hath built vpon, abide, he shall receiue wages.

15. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but 

16. 
          

17. If any man 

18.

1. Let

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a 

10. We are fooles for Christes sake, and ye are wise in Christ: we are weake, and ye are strong: ye are honourable, and we are despised.

11. Vnto this houre we both hunger, & thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and haue no certaine dwelling place,

12. And labour, working with our owne handes: we are reuiled, and yet we blesse: we are persecuted, and suffer it.

13. Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the 

14. 
          

15. For though ye haue tenne thousand instructours in Christ, yet haue ye not many fathers: for in Christ Iesus I haue begotten you through the Gospel.

16. Wherefore, I pray you, be ye folowers of me.

17. For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my 

18. 
          

19. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the 

20. For the kingdome of God is not in worde, but in power.

4. In the

7. 
          

8. Therefore let us keep the 

9. 
          

10. Yet not 

11. But nowe I haue written vnto you, that ye companie not together: if any that is called a brother, be a fornicatour, or couetous, or an idolater, or a rayler, or a drunkard, or an extorsioner, with such one eate not.

12. 
          

13. But God iudgeth them that are without. Put away therefore from among your selues that wicked man.

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Dare 

2. 
          

3. Knowe ye not that we shall iudge the Angels? howe much more, things that perteine to this life?

4. 
          

5. 
          

6. But a brother goeth to law with a brother, and that vnder the infidels.

7. 
          

8. Nay, yee your selues doe wrong, and doe harme, and that to your brethren.

9. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? 

10. Nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall inherite the kingdome of God.

11. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the 

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. And God hath also raised vp the Lord, and shall raise vs vp by his power.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. But hee that is ioyned vnto the Lorde, is one spirite.

18. 
          

19. 
          

20. For yee are bought for a price: therefore glorifie God in your bodie, and in your spirit: for they are Gods.

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Now 

2. Neuertheles, to auoide fornication, let euery man haue his wife, and let euery woman haue her owne husband.

3. 
          

4. 
          

5. Defraud ye not one the other, 

6. 
          

7. For I 

8. 
          

9. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to 

10. 
          

11. But and if shee depart, let her remaine vnmaried, or be reconciled vnto her husband, & let not the husband put away his wife.

12. 
          

13. And the woman which hath an husbande that beleeueth not, if he be content to dwell with her, let her not forsake him.

14. 
          

15. 
          

16. For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt saue thine husband? Or what knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt saue thy wife?

17. 
          

18. 
          

19. Circumcision is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandements of God.

20. Let euery man abide in the same vocation wherein he was called.

21. Art thou called [being] a servant? 

22. For he that is called in the 

23. 
          

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. I suppose therefore that 

27. Art thou bounde vnto a wife? Seeke not to be loosed: art thou loosed from a wife? Seeke not a wife.

28. But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the 

29. But this I say, brethren, the time [is] 

30. And they that 

31. And they that use this 

32. And I would haue you without care. The vnmaried careth for the things of the Lord, howe he may please the Lord.

33. But he that is married 

34. There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in 

35. And this I speak for your own 

36. 
          

37. Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his 

38. So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth 

39. 
          

40. But shee is more blessed, if she so abide, in my iudgement: and I thinke that I haue also the Spirite of God.

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. Now 

2. Nowe, if any man thinke that hee knoweth any thing, hee knoweth nothing yet as hee ought to knowe.

3. But if any man loue God, the same is knowen of him.

4. 
          

5. For though there bee that are called gods, whether in heauen, or in earth (as there be many gods, and many lords)

6. But to us [there is but] one God, the Father, 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. But take heede lest by any meanes this power of yours be an occasion of falling, to them that are weake.

6. Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for 

10. Either saith hee it not altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt it is written, that he which eareth, should eare in hope, & that he that thresheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live 

15. But I have used none of these things: 

16. For though I preach the Gospel, I haue nothing to reioyce of: for necessitie is laid vpon me, and woe is vnto me, if I preach not the Gospel.

17. For if I do it willingly, I haue a reward, but if I do it against my will, notwithstanding the dispensation is committed vnto me.

18. What is my reward then? [Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ 

19. For though I bee free from all men, yet haue I made my selfe seruant vnto all men, that I might winne the moe.

20. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the 

21. To them that are without Lawe, as though I were without Lawe, (when I am not without Lawe as pertaining to God, but am in the Lawe through Christ) that I may winne them that are without Lawe:

22. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to 

23. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with

5. But with many of them God was not pleased: for they were ouerthrowen in ye wildernes.

6. 
          

7. Neither bee ye idolaters as were some of them, as it is written, The people sate downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play.

8. Neither let vs commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twentie thousand.

9. Neither let us tempt 

10. Neither murmure ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.

11. Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the

20. But I [say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have

28. But if any man say vnto you, This is sacrificed vnto idoles, eate it not, because of him that shewed it, and for the conscience (for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is)

29. Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: 

30. For if I by

33. Euen as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine owne profite, but the profite of many, that they might be saued.

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be yee followers of mee, euen as I am of Christ.

6. Therefore if the woman be not couered, let her also be shorne: and if it be shame for a woman to be shorne or shauen, let her be couered.

9. 
          

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman: but all things are of God.

13. 
          

14. Doeth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man haue long heare, it is a shame vnto him?

15. But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a

20. When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is 

21. For in eating every one taketh

24. And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is 

25. After the same maner also he tooke the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the Newe Testament in my blood: this doe as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me.

26. For as often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till hee come.

27. 
          

28. 
          

29. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not

16. And if the eare would say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?

17. 
          

18. But nowe hath God disposed the members euery one of them in the bodie at his owne pleasure.

19. For if they were all one member, where were the body?

20. But now are there many members, yet but one body.

21. 
          

22. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be 

23. And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant

27. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in

29. Are all Apostles? are all Prophetes? are all teachers?

30. Are all doers of miracles? haue all the gifts of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all interprete?

5. I would that ye all spake strange languages, but rather that ye prophecied: for greater is hee that prophecieth, then hee that speaketh diuers tongues, except hee expounde it, that the Church may receiue edification.

6. And nowe, brethren, if I come vnto you speaking diuers tongues, what shall I profite you, except I speake to you, either by reuelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecying, or by doctrine?

7. 
          

8. And also if the trumpet giue an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to battell?

9. So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words 

10. 
          

11. Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that 

12. 
          

13. Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue

24. But if all prophecie, and there come in one that beleeueth not, or one vnlearned, hee is rebuked of all men, and is iudged of all,

25. And so are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so he will fall downe on his face and worship God, and say plainely that God is in you in deede.

26. 
          

27. 
          

28. But if there be no interpreter, let him keepe silence in the Church, which speaketh languages, and let him speake to himselfe, and to God.

29. 
          

30. And if any thing be reueiled to another that sitteth by, let the first holde his peace.

31. For ye may all prophecie one by one, that all may learne, and all may haue comfort.

32. And the 

33. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as we see in all ye Churches of the Saints.

34. 
          

35. And if they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speake in the Church.

36. 
          

37. If any man think himself to be a prophet, or

40. Let all things be done honestly, and by order.

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. Moreover, 

2. By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, 

3. For first of all, I deliuered vnto you that which I receiued, how that Christ died for our sinnes, according to the Scriptures,

4. And that he was buried, and that he arose the third day, according to the Scriptures,

5. And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the 

6. After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at 

7. After that, he was seene of Iames: then of all the Apostles.

8. 
          

9. For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meete to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.

10. But by the grace of God, I am that I am: and his grace which is in me, was not in vaine: but I laboured more aboundantly then they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.

11. Wherefore, whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so haue ye beleeued.
