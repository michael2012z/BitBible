## Deuteronomy 1

1. These [be] the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on 

2. ([There are] eleven days' [journey] from 

3. And it came to passe in the first day of the eleuenth moneth, in the fourtieth yeere that Moses spake vnto the children of Israel according vnto all that the Lord had giuen him in commandement vnto them,

4. After he had slain 

5. On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, 

6. The LORD our God spake unto us in 

7. Turne you and depart, and goe vnto the mountaine of the Amorites, and vnto all places neere thereunto in the plaine, in the mountaine, or in the valley: both Southwarde, and to the Sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and vnto Lebanon: euen vnto the great riuer, the riuer Perath.

8. Beholde, I haue set the land before you: go in and possesse that land which the Lorde sware vnto your fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob, to giue vnto them and to their seede after them.

9. And I spake 

10. The LORD your God hath 

11. (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many moe as ye are, and blesse you, as he hath promised you)

12. How can I myself alone 

13. Take you wise men, and understanding, and 

14. Then ye answered me and said, The thing is good that thou hast commanded vs to doe.

15. So I took the chief of your tribes, 

16. And I charged your iudges that same time, saying, Heare the controuersies betweene your brethren, and iudge righteously betwene euery man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

17. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is] 

18. Also I commaunded you the same time all the things which ye should doe.

19. Then we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wildernesse (as yee haue seene) by the way of the mountaine of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commaunded vs: and we came to Kadesh-barnea.

20. And 

21. Beholde, the Lord thy God hath layde the land before thee: go vp and possesse it, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath saide vnto thee: feare not, neither be discouraged.

22. 
          

23. So the saying pleased me well, and I tooke twelue men of you, of euery tribe one.

24. Who departed, and went vp into the mountaine, and came vnto the riuer Eshcol, and searched out the land.

25. And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down unto us, and brought us word again, and 

26. Notwithstanding, ye would not go vp, but were disobedient vnto the commaundement of the Lord your God,

27. And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD 

28. Whither shall we go up? our 

29. But I sayd vnto you, Dread not, nor be afrayd of them.

30. The LORD your God 

31. And in the wildernesse, where thou hast seene how the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doeth beare his sonne, in all the way which ye haue gone, vntill ye came vnto this place.

32. Yet for all this ye did not beleeue the Lord your God,

33. Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tentes in, in fire by night, that ye might see what way to goe, and in a cloude by day.

34. Then the Lorde heard the voyce of your wordes, and was wroth, and sware, saying,

35. Surely there shall not one of these men of this froward generation, see that good land, which I sware to giue vnto your fathers,

36. Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh: he shall see it, and to him will I giue the land that he hath troden vpon, and to his children, because he hath constantly followed the Lord.

37. Also the Lorde was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not goe in thither,

38. [But] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth 

39. Moreover your 

40. But as for you, turne backe, and take your iourney into the wildernesse by the way of the red Sea.

41. Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, 

42. And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] 

43. And when I told you, ye would not heare, but rebelled against the commaundement of the Lord, and were presumptuous, and went vp into the mountaine.

44. Then the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine came out against you, and chased you (as bees vse to doe) and destroied you in Seir, euen vnto Hormah.

45. And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not 

46. So ye abode in Kadesh a long time, according to the time that ye had remained before.

## Deuteronomy 2

1. Then 

2. And the Lord spake vnto me, saying,

3. Ye haue compassed this mountaine long ynough: turne you Northward.

4. And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the 

5. Ye shall not prouoke them: for I wil not giue you of their land so much as a foot breadth, because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau for a possession.

6. Ye shall buy meate of them for money to eate, and ye shall also procure water of them for money to drinke.

7. For the LORD thy God hath 

8. And when we were departed from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plaine, from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and went by the way of the wildernes of Moab.

9. And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children 

10. The 

11. They also were taken for gyants as the Anakims: whom the Moabites call Emims.

12. The Horims also dwelt in Seir before time, whome the children of Esau chased out and destroyed them before them, and dwelt in their steade: as Israel shall doe vnto the land of his possession, which the Lord hath giuen them.

13. Now rise vp, sayd I, and get you ouer the riuer Zered: and we went ouer the riuer Zered.

14. And the 

15. For indeed the 

16. So when all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people:

17. Then the Lord spake vnto me, saying,

18. Thou shalt goe through Ar the coast of Moab this day:

19. And thou shalt come neere ouer against the children of Ammon: but shalt not lay siege vnto them, nor moue warre against them: for I will not giue thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession: for I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot for a possession.

20. (That also was accounted a land 

21. A people that was great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims: but the Lord destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them in their inheritance, and dwelt in their stead:

22. As he did to the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims before them, and they possessed them, and dwelt in their stead vnto this day.

23. And the Auims which dwelt in Hazarim euen vnto Azzah, the Caphtorims which came out of Caphtor destroyed them, and dwelt in their steade.

24. Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the 

25. This day will I 

26. Then I sent messengers out of the wildernes of Kedemoth vnto Sihon King of Heshbon, with wordes of peace, saying,

27. Let me passe through thy land: I will go by the hie way: I will neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left.

28. Thou shalt sell me meate for money, for to eate, and shalt giue me water for money for to drinke: onely I will go through on my foote,

29. (As the 

30. But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God 

31. And the Lorde sayd vnto me, Beholde, I haue begun to giue Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possesse and inherite his land.

32. Then came out Sihon to meete vs, him selfe with all his people to fight at Iahaz.

33. But the Lord our God deliuered him into our power, and we smote him, and his sonnes, and all his people.

34. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the 

35. Onely the cattell we tooke to our selues, and the spoyle of the cities which we tooke,

36. From Aroer, which is by the banke of the riuer of Arnon, and from the citie that is vpon the riuer, euen vnto Gilead: there was not one citie that escaped vs: for the Lorde our God deliuered vp all before vs.

37. Onely vnto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor vnto any place of the riuer Iabbok, nor vnto the cities in the mountaines, nor vnto whatsoeuer the Lorde our God forbade vs.

## Deuteronomy 3

1. Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan 

2. And the Lorde sayde vnto me, Feare him not, for I will deliuer him, and all his people, and his land into thine hand, and thou shalt doe vnto him as thou diddest vnto Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

3. So the Lorde our God deliuered also vnto our hand, Og the King of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him, vntill none was left him aliue,

4. And we tooke all his cities the same time, neither was there a citie which we tooke not from them, euen three score cities, and all ye countrey of Argob, the kingdome of Og in Bashan.

5. All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside 

6. And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, 

7. But all the cattell and the spoyle of the cities we tooke for our selues.

8. Thus we tooke at that time out of the hand of two Kings of the Amorites, the land that was on this side Iorden from the riuer of Arnon vnto mount Hermon:

9. (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Shirion, but the Amorites call it Shenir)

10. All the cities of the plaine, and all Gilead, and all Bashan vnto Salchah, and Edrei, cities of the kingdome of Og in Bashan.

11. For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his 

12. And this land which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the riuer of Arnon, and halfe mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gaue I vnto the Reubenites and Gadites.

13. And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdome of Og, gaue I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh: euen all the countrey of Argob with all Bashan, which is called, The land of gyants.

14. Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto 

15. And I gaue part of Gilead vnto Machir.

16. And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river 

17. The plaine also and Iorden, and the borders from Chinnereth euen vnto the Sea of the plaine, to wit, the salt Sea vnder the springs of Pisgah Eastwarde.

18. And I commanded 

19. Your wiues onely, and your children, and your cattel (for I know that ye haue much cattel) shall abide in your cities, which I haue giuen you,

20. Vntill the Lorde haue giuen rest vnto your brethren as vnto you, and that they also possesse the lande, which the Lorde your God hath giuen them beyond Iorden: then shall ye returne euery man vnto his possession, which I haue giuen you.

21. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the 

22. Ye shall not feare them: for the Lord your God, he shall fight for you.

23. And I besought the Lorde the same time, saying,

24. O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can 

25. I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that [is] beyond Jordan, that goodly 

26. But the Lord was angrie with me for your sakes, and would not heare me: and the Lord said vnto me, Let it suffice thee, speake no more vnto me of this matter.

27. Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and 

28. But charge Ioshua, and incourage him, and bolden him: for hee shall goe before this people, and he shall deuide for inheritance vnto them, the land which thou shalt see.

29. So wee abode in the valley ouer against Beth-Peor.

## Deuteronomy 4

1. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to 

2. Ye shall 

3. Your 

4. But ye that did 

5. Behold, I haue taught you ordinances, and lawes, as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should doe euen so within the land whither ye goe to possesse it.

6. Keep therefore and do [them]; for this [is] your 

7. For what nation [is there so] great, who [hath] God [so] 

8. And what nation is so great, that hath ordinances and lawes so righteous, as all this Lawe, which I set before you this day?

9. Only take heed to thyself, and 

10. Forget not the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said vnto me, Gather me the people together, and I wil cause them heare my wordes, that they may learne to feare me all the dayes that they shal liue vpon the earth, and that they may teache their children:

11. And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain 

12. And the Lorde spake vnto you out of the middes of the fire, and ye heard the voyce of the wordes, but sawe no similitude, saue a voyce.

13. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to 

14. And the Lord commanded me that same time, that I should teach you ordinances & lawes, which ye should obserue in the lande, whither ye goe, to possesse it.

15. Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no 

16. That ye corrupt not your selues, and make you a grauen image or representation of any figure: whither it be the likenes of male or female,

17. The likenes of any beast that is on earth, or the likenesse of any fethered foule that flieth in the aire:

18. Or the likenesse of any thing that creepeth on the earth, or the likenesse of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth,

19. And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, [even] all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath 

20. But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the 

21. And the Lord was angrie with me for your words, and sware that I should not goe ouer Iorden, and that I should not goe in vnto that good land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance.

22. But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but 

23. Take heede vnto your selues, least ye forget the couenant of the Lorde your God which hee made with you, and least ye make you any grauen image, or likenes of any thing, as the Lorde thy God hath charged thee.

24. For the LORD thy God [is] a 

25. When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall 

26. I 

27. And the LORD shall 

28. And there ye shall serue gods, euen ye worke of mans hand, wood, and stone, which neither see, nor heare, nor eate, nor smell.

29. But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find [him], if thou seek him with all thy 

30. When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come vpon thee, at the length if thou returne to the Lorde thy God, and bee obedient vnto his voyce,

31. (For the LORD thy God [is] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he 

32. For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and 

33. Did euer people heare the voyce of God speaking out of the middes of a fire, as thou hast heard, and liued?

34. Or hath God assayed to go [and] take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by 

35. Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest 

36. Out of heauen hee made thee heare his voyce to instruct thee, and vpon earth he shewed thee his great fire, and thou heardest his voyce out of the middes of the fire.

37. And because 

38. To thrust out nations greater and mightier then thou, before thee, to bring thee in, and to giue thee their land for inheritance: as appeareth this day.

39. Vnderstande therefore this day, and consider in thine heart, that the Lord, he is God in heauen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath: there is none other.

40. Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may 

41. Then Moses separated three cities on this side of Iorden toward the sunne rising:

42. That the slayer should flee thither, which had killed his neighbour at vnwares, and hated him not in time past, might flee, I say, vnto one of those cities, and liue:

43. That is, Bezer in the wildernesse, in the plaine countrey of the Reubenites: and Ramoth in Gilead among the Gadites: and Golan in Bashan among them of Manasseh.

44. So this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.

45. These [are] the 

46. On this side Iorden, in the valley ouer against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come out of Egypt:

47. And they possessed his land, and the lande of Og King of Bashan, two Kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Iorden towarde the sunne rising:

48. From Aroer, which is by the banke of the riuer Arnon, euen vnto mount Sion, which is Hermon,

49. And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto 

## Deuteronomy 5

1. Then Moses called all Israiel, and saide vnto them, Heare, O Israel, the ordinances and the lawes which I propose to you this day, that yee may learne them, and take heede to obserue them.

2. The Lord our God made a couenant with vs in Horeb.

3. The LORD 

4. The LORD talked with you 

5. (At that time I stoode betweene the Lorde and you, to declare vnto you ye word of the Lord: for ye were afraid at the sight of the fire, and went not vp into the mount, and he said,

6. I am the Lorde thy God, which haue brought thee out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

7. Thou shalt have none 

8. Thou shalt make thee no grauen image or any likenesse of that that is in heauen aboue, or which is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters vnder the earth.

9. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a 

10. And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that 

11. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vaine: for the Lorde will not holde him giltlesse that taketh his Name in vaine.

12. Keepe the Sabbath day, to sanctifie it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.

13. Six days 

14. But the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt not doe any worke therein, thou, nor thy sonne, nor thy daughter, nor thy man seruant, nor thy mayd, nor thine oxe, nor thine asse, neither any of thy cattel, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: that thy man seruant and thy mayde may rest aswell as thou.

15. For, remember that thou wast a seruant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lorde thy God brought thee out thence by a mightie hand and a stretched out arme: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to obserue the Sabbath day.

16. 
          

17. Thou shalt not kill.

18. Neither shalt thou commit adulterie.

19. Neither shalt thou steale.

20. Neither shalt thou beare false witnesse against thy neighbour.

21. Neither shalt 

22. These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he 

23. And when ye heard the voyce out of the middes of the darkenes, (for the mountaine did burne with fire) then ye came to me, all the chiefe of your tribes, and your Elders:

24. And ye sayd, Beholde, the Lord our God hath shewed vs his glory and his greatnes, and we haue heard his voyce out of the middes of the fire: we haue seene this day that God doeth talke with man, and he liueth.

25. Now therefore, why should we dye? for this great fire wil consume vs: if we heare ye voyce of the Lord our God any more, we shall dye.

26. For what flesh was there euer, that heard the voyce of the liuing God speaking out of the middes of the fire as we haue, and liued?

27. Go thou neere and heare all that the Lord our God saith: and declare thou vnto vs all that the Lorde our God saith vnto thee, and we will heare it, and doe it.

28. Then the Lorde heard the voyce of your wordes, when ye spake vnto me: and the Lorde sayd vnto me, I haue heard the voyce of ye wordes of this people, which they haue spoken vnto thee: they haue well sayd, all that they haue spoken.

29. O 

30. Go, say vnto them, Returne you into your tentes.

31. But stand thou here with me, and I wil tell thee all the commaundements, and the ordinances, and the lawes, which thou shalt teach them: that they may doe them in the land which I giue them to possesse it.

32. Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not 

33. Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may 

## Deuteronomy 6

1. These now are the commandements, ordinances, and lawes, which the Lorde your God commanded me to teach you, that ye might doe them in the land whither ye go to possesse it:

2. That thou mayest 

3. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it]; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, 

4. Heare, O Israel, The Lord our God is Lord onely,

5. And thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy might.

6. And these wordes which I commaund thee this day, shalbe in thine heart.

7. And thou shalt 

8. And thou shalt binde them for a signe vpon thine hand, and they shalbe as frontlets betweene thine eyes.

9. And thou shalt write them upon the 

10. And when the Lord thy God hath brought thee into the land, which he sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob, to giue to thee, with great and goodly cities which thou buildedst not,

11. And houses full of all maner of goods which thou filledst not, and welles digged which thou diggedst not, vineyards & oliue trees which thou plantedst not, and when thou hast eaten and art full,

12. 
          

13. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt 

14. Ye shall not walke after other gods, after any of the gods of the people which are round about you,

15. (For the Lorde thy God is a ielous God among you:) least the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from the face of the earth.

16. Ye shall not 

17. But ye shal keepe diligently the commandements of the Lord your God, and his testimonies, and his ordinances which he hath commanded thee,

18. And thou shalt do [that which is] right and good in the 

19. To cast out all thine enemies before thee, as the Lord hath sayd.

20. [And] when 

21. Then shalt thou say vnto thy sonne, We were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt: but the Lord brought vs out of Egypt with a mightie hand.

22. And the Lord shewed signes and wonders great and euill vpon Egypt, vpon Pharaoh, and vpon all his housholde, before our eyes,

23. And he 

24. Therefore the Lord hath commanded vs, to doe all these ordinances, and to feare the Lord our God, that it may goe euer well with vs, and that he may preserue vs aliue as at this present.

25. And it shall be our 

## Deuteronomy 7

1. When the Lorde thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possesse it, and shall roote out many nations before thee: the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, seuen nations greater and mightier then thou,

2. And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them 

3. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them, neither giue thy daughter vnto his sonne, nor take his daughter vnto thy sonne.

4. For they wil cause thy sonne to turne away from me, and to serue other gods: then will the wrath of the Lord waxe hote against you and destroy thee suddenly.

5. But thus shall ye deal with them; 

6. For thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God, the Lorde thy God hath chosen thee, to be a precious people vnto himselfe, aboue all people that are vpon the earth.

7. The Lord did not set his loue vpon you, nor chose you, because ye were mo in number then any people: for ye were the fewest of all people:

8. But because the LORD 

9. Know therefore 

10. And repayeth 

11. Keepe thou therefore the commaundements, and the ordinances, and the lawes, which I commaund thee this day to doe them.

12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the 

13. And he wil loue thee, and blesse thee, and multiplie thee: he will also blesse the fruite of thy wombe, and the fruite of thy land, thy corne and thy wine, and thine oyle and the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe in the land, which he sware vnto thy fathers to giue thee.

14. Thou shalt be blessed aboue all people: there shall be neither male nor female barren among you, nor among your cattell.

15. Moreouer, the Lorde will take away from thee all infirmities, and will put none of the euill diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) vpon thee, but wil send them vpon all that hate thee.

16. And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; 

17. If thou say in thine heart, These nations are moe then I, how can I cast them out?

18. Thou shalt not feare them, but remember what the Lord thy God did vnto Pharaoh, and vnto all Egypt:

19. The great tentations which thine eyes sawe, and the signes and wonders, and the mighty hand and stretched out arme, whereby the Lorde thy God brought thee out: so shall the Lord thy God do vnto all ye people, whose face thou fearest.

20. Moreover the LORD thy God will send the 

21. Thou shalt not feare them: for the Lorde thy God is among you, a God mightie & dreadful.

22. And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the 

23. But the Lord thy God shall giue them before thee, and shall destroy them with a mightie destruction, vntill they be brought to naught.

24. And he shall deliuer their Kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from vnder heauen: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, vntill thou hast destroyed them.

25. The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold [that is] on them, nor take [it] unto thee, lest thou 

26. Bring not therefore abomination into thine house, lest, thou be accursed like it, but vtterly abhorre it, and count it most abominable: for it is accursed.

## Deuteronomy 8

1. All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe 

2. And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and] to 

3. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by 

4. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot 

5. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, [so] the LORD thy God 

6. Therefore shalt thou keepe the commaundements of the Lorde thy God, that thou mayest walke in his wayes, and feare him.

7. For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land in the which are riuers of water and fountaines, and depthes that spring out of valleis and mountaines:

8. A land of wheate and barley, and of vineyards, and figtrees, and pomegranates: a land of oyle oliue and hony:

9. A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any [thing] in it; a land 

10. When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt 

11. Beware that thou forget not the Lorde thy God, not keeping his commandements, and his lawes, and his ordinances, which I commaunde thee this day:

12. Lest when thou hast eaten and filled thy selfe, and hast built goodly houses & dwelt therein,

13. And thy beastes, and thy sheepe are increased, and thy siluer and golde is multiplied, and all that thou hast is increased,

14. Then thine heart 

15. Who was thy guide in the great and terrible wildernes (wherein were fierie serpents, & scorpions, and drought, where was no water, who brought forth water for thee out of ye rock of flint:

16. Who fed thee in the wildernesse with MAN, which thy fathers knewe not) to humble thee, and and to proue thee, that he might doe thee good at thy latter ende.

17. Beware least thou say in thine heart, My power, and the strength of mine owne hand hath prepared me this abundance.

18. But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for [it is] he that 

19. And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I 

20. As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before you, so ye shall perish, because ye woulde not be obedient vnto the voyce of the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 9

1. Hear, O Israel: Thou [art] to pass over Jordan 

2. A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and [of whom] thou hast 

3. Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God [is] he which 

4. Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my 

5. For thou entrest not to inherite their lande for thy righteousnesse, or for thy vpright heart: but for the wickednesse of those nations, the Lord thy God doth cast them out before thee, and that he might performe the worde which the Lord thy God sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iacob.

6. Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou [art] a 

7. Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: 

8. Also in Horeb ye prouoked the Lorde to anger so that the Lord was wroth with you, euen to destroy you.

9. When I was gone vp into the mount, to receiue the tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant, which the Lord made with you: and I abode in the mount fourtie daies & fourtie nights, and I neither ate bread nor yet dranke water:

10. And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the 

11. And when the fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes were ended, the Lorde gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant.

12. And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have 

13. Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto me, saying, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stifnecked people.

14. 
          

15. So I returned, and came downe from the Mount (and the Mount burnt with fire, and ye two Tables of the couenant were in my two handes)

16. And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, [and] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the 

17. Therefore I tooke the two Tables, and cast them out of my two handes, and brake them before your eyes.

18. And I fell downe before the Lorde, fourtie dayes, and fourtie nightes, as before: I neither ate bread nor dranke water, because of al your sinnes, which ye had committed, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lorde, in that ye prouoked him vnto wrath.

19. (For I was afraide of the wrath and indignation, wherewith the Lord was mooued against you, euen to destroy you) yet the Lord heard me at that time also.

20. And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have 

21. And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] very small, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the 

22. Also in Taberah, & in Massah and in Kibrothhattaauah ye prouoked ye Lord to anger.

23. Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye 

24. Ye haue bene rebellious vnto the Lorde, since the day that I knewe you.

25. Thus I fell down before the LORD 

26. And I prayed vnto the Lorde, and saide, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatnesse, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt by a mightie hand.

27. 
          

28. Lest the countrey, whence thou broughtest them, say, Because ye Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, or because he hated them, he caried them out, to slay them in the wildernesse.

29. Yet they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mightie power, and by thy stretched out arme.

## Deuteronomy 10

1. In the same time the Lord said vnto me, Hewe thee two Tables of stone like vnto the first, and come vp vnto me into the Mount, and make thee an Arke of wood,

2. And I will write vpon the Tables ye wordes that were vpon the first Tables, which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the Arke.

3. And I made an ark [of] 

4. And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the 

5. And I departed, and came downe from the Mount, and put the Tables in the Arke which I had made: and there they be, as the Lorde commanded me.

6. And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to 

7. From thence they departed vnto Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Iotbath a land of running waters.

8. At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to 

9. Wherefore Levi hath no part nor 

10. And I taried in the mount, as at ye first time, fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes, and the Lorde heard me at that time also, and the Lorde would not destroy thee.

11. But the Lord said vnto me, Arise, goe forth in the iourney before the people, that they may goe in and possesse the land, which I sware vnto their fathers to giue vnto them.

12. And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God 

13. That thou keepe the commaundements of the Lord, and his ordinances, which I commaunde thee this day, for thy wealth?

14. Beholde, heauen, & the heauen of heauens is the Lords thy God, and the earth, with all that therein is.

15. 
          

16. 
          

17. For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lordes, a great God, mightie and terrible, which accepteth no persons nor taketh reward:

18. Who doeth right vnto the fatherlesse and widowe, & loueth the stranger, giuing him foode and rayment.

19. Loue ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

20. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and 

21. He is thy praise, and hee is thy God, that hath done for thee these great & terrible things, which thine eyes haue seene.

22. Thy fathers went downe into Egypt with seuentie persons, and now the Lord thy God hath made thee, as ye starres of ye heauen in multitude.

## Deuteronomy 11

1. Therefore thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, and shalt keepe that, which he commandeth to be kept: that is, his ordinances, and his lawes, and his commandements alway.

2. And 

3. And his signes, and his actes, which hee did in the middes of Egypt vnto Pharaoh the King of Egypt and vnto all his land:

4. And what he did vnto the hoste of the Egyptians, vnto their horses, and to their charets, when he caused the waters of the red Sea to ouerflowe them, as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroied them vnto this day:

5. And 

6. And what he did vnto Dathan & Abiram the sonnes of Eliab ye sonne of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, & swallowed them with their housholds and their tents, and all their substance that they had in the middes of al Israel.

7. For your eyes haue seene all the great actes of the Lord which he did.

8. Therefore shall ye keep 

9. Also that ye may prolong your daies in the land, which the Lorde sware vnto your fathers, to giue vnto them and to their seede, euen a lande that floweth with milke and honie.

10. For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst [it] with thy 

11. But the land whither ye goe to possesse it, is a land of mountaines and valleis, and drinketh water of the raine of heauen.

12. This land doth the Lord thy God care for: the eies of the Lord thy God are alwaies vpon it, from the beginning of the yeere, euen vnto the ende of the yeere.

13. If yee shall hearken therefore vnto my commaundements, which I commaund you this day, that yee loue the Lorde your God and serue him with all your heart, and with all your soule,

14. That I will give [you] the rain of your land in his due season, 

15. Also I will send grasse in thy fieldes, for thy cattel, that thou maist eate, and haue inough.

16. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not 

17. And so the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut vp the heauen, that there be no raine, and that your lande yeelde not her fruit, and yee perish quickly from the good land, which the Lord giueth you.

18. Therefore shal ye lay vp these my words in your heart and in your soule, and binde them for a signe vpon your hand, that they may be as a frontlet betweene your eyes,

19. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them, whe thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp.

20. And thou shalt write them vpon the postes of thine house, and vpon thy gates,

21. That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as 

22. For if ye keepe diligently all these commandements, which I command you to doe: that is, to loue the Lord your God, to walke in all his waies, and to cleaue vnto him,

23. Then will the Lorde cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall possesse great nations and mightier then you.

24. Every place whereon the soles of 

25. No man shall stande against you: for the Lorde your God shall cast the feare and dread of you vpon all the land that ye shal treade vpon, as he hath said vnto you.

26. Beholde, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:

27. The blessing, if ye obey the commandements of the Lorde your God which I command you this day:

28. And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not 

29. When the Lord thy God therefore hath brought thee into ye lande, whither thou goest to possesse it, then thou shalt put the blessing vpon mount Gerizim, and the curse vpon mount Ebal.

30. [Are] they not on the other side Jordan, by the way 

31. For yee shall passe ouer Iorden, to goe in to possesse the land, which ye Lorde your God giueth you, and ye shall possesse it, & dwell therein.

32. Take heede therefore that ye doe all the commaundements and the lawes, which I set before you this day.

## Deuteronomy 12

1. These [are] the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God 

2. Yee shall vtterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shal possesse, serued their gods vpon the hie mountaines and vpon the hilles, and vnder euery greene tree.

3. And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their 

4. Ye shall 

5. But ye shal seeke the place which the Lord your God shall chose out of all your tribes, to put his Name there, and there to dwell, and thither thou shalt come,

6. And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave 

7. And there ye shall eat 

8. Ye shall not do after all [the things] that we do 

9. For ye are not yet come to rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord thy God giueth thee.

10. But [when] ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and [when] he giveth you 

11. When there shalbe a place which the Lord your God shall chose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall yee bring all that I commaund you: your burnt offrings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the offring of your hands, and all your speciall vowes which ye vowe vnto the Lord:

12. And ye shall reioyce before the Lord your God, yee, and your sonnes & your daughters, and your seruaunts, and your maidens, and the Leuite that is within your gates: for hee hath no part nor inheritance with you.

13. Take heede that thou offer not thy burnt offrings in euery place that thou seest:

14. But in the place which the LORD shall 

15. Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the 

16. Onely ye shal not eat the blood, but powre it vpon the earth as water.

17. Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the 

18. But thou shalt eate it before the Lorde thy God, in the place which the Lorde thy God shall chuse, thou, & thy sonne, & thy daughter, & thy seruat, and thy maid, and the Leuite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God, in all that thou puttest thine hand to.

19. Beware, that thou forsake not the Leuite, as long as thou liuest vpon the earth.

20. When the Lorde thy God shall enlarge thy border, as hee hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I wil eate flesh, (because thine heart longeth to eate flesh) thou maiest eate flesh, whatsoeuer thine heart desireth.

21. If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put his Name there, be farre from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy bullockes, and of thy sheepe which the Lorde hath giuen thee, as I haue commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates, whatsoeuer thine heart desireth.

22. Euen as the roe bucke, and the hart is eaten, so shalt thou eat them. both the vncleane and the cleane shall eate of them alike.

23. Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood 

24. Therefore thou shalt not eat it, but powre it vpon the earth as water.

25. Thou shalt not eat it, that it may go wel with thee; and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt doe that which is right in the sight of the Lord:

26. Only thy 

27. And thou shalt make thy burnt offerings of the flesh, and of the blood vpon the altar of the Lorde thy God, and the blood of thine offerings shall bee powred vpon the altar of the Lorde thy God, and thou shalt eate the flesh.

28. Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go 

29. When the Lorde thy God shall destroy the nations before thee, whither thou goest to possesse them, and thou shalt possesse them and dwell in their lande,

30. Take heed to thyself that thou be not 

31. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have 

32. Therefore whatsoeuer I command you, take heede you doe it: thou shalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom.

## Deuteronomy 13

1. If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of 

2. And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, 

3. Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God 

4. Yee shall walke after the Lorde your God and feare him, and shall keepe his commaundements, and hearken vnto his voyce, and yee shall serue him, and cleaue vnto him.

5. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be 

6. If 

7. Any of the gods of the people which are round about you, neere vnto thee or farre off from thee, from the one ende of the earth vnto ye other:

8. Thou shalt not cosent vnto him, nor heare him, neither shall thine eye pitie him, nor shewe mercie, nor keepe him secret:

9. But thou shalt surely kill him; 

10. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he dye (because he hath gone about to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of ye land of Egypt, from ye house of bondage)

11. That all Israel may heare and feare, and doe no more any such wickednesse as this among you.

12. If thou shalt heare say (concerning any of thy cities which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee to dwell in)

13. Wicked men are gone out from among you, & haue drawen away the inhabitants of their citie, saying, Let vs go and serue other gods, which ye haue not knowen,

14. Then shalt 

15. Thou shalt euen slay the inhabitants of that citie with the edge of the sworde: destroy it vtterly, and all that is therein, and the cattel thereof with the edge of the sworde.

16. And 

17. And there shall cleave nought of the 

18. When thou shalt obey the voyce of the Lord thy God, and keepe all his commandements which I command thee this day, that thou do that which is right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.

## Deuteronomy 14

1. Ye are the children of the Lord your God. Ye shall not cut yourselues, nor make you any baldnesse betweene your eyes for the dead.

2. For thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a 

3. Thou shalt eate no maner of abominatio.

4. 
          

5. The hart, and the roe buck, and the bugle, and the wilde goate, and the vnicorne, & the wilde oxe, and the chamois.

6. And euery beast that parteth ye hoofe, and cleaueth the clift into two clawes, and is of the beasts that cheweth the cudde, that shall ye eate.

7. But these ye shall not eate, of them that chew the cud, and of them that deuide and cleaue the hoofe onely: ye camell, nor the hare, nor the cony: for they chewe the cudde, but deuide not ye hoofe: therefore they shall be vncleane vnto you:

8. Also the swine, because he deuideth the hoofe, and cheweth not the cud, shalbe vncleane vnto you: ye shal not eate of their flesh, nor touch their dead carkeises.

9. These ye shall eate, of all that are in the waters: all that haue finnes and scales shall ye eate.

10. And whatsoeuer hath no finnes nor scales, ye shall not eate: it shall be vncleane vnto you.

11. Of all cleane birdes ye shall eate:

12. But these are they, whereof ye shall not eate: the egle, nor the goshawke, nor the osprey,

13. Nor the glead nor the kite, nor the vulture, after their kind,

14. Nor all kinde of rauens,

15. Nor the ostrich, nor the nightcrow, nor the semeaw, nor the hawke after her kinde,

16. Neither the litle owle, nor the great owle, nor the redshanke,

17. Nor the pellicane, nor the swanne, nor the cormorant:

18. The storke also, and the heron in his kinde, nor the lapwing, nor the backe.

19. And euery creeping thing that flieth, shall be vncleane vnto you: it shall not be eaten.

20. But of all cleane foules ye may eate.

21. Ye shall not eat [of] any thing that 

22. Thou shalt truly 

23. And thou shalt eate before the Lorde thy God (in the place which he shall chose to cause his Name to dwell there) the tithe of thy corne, of thy wine, and of thine oyle, and the first borne of thy kine and of thy sheepe, that thou maiest learne to feare the Lord thy God alway.

24. And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; [or] if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, 

25. Then shalt thou make it in money, and take the money in thine hand, and goe vnto the place which the Lord thy God shall chose.

26. And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: 

27. And the Leuite that is within thy gates, shalt thou not forsake: for he hath neither part nor inheritance with thee.

28. At the end of three years thou shalt 

29. Then ye Leuite shall come, because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee, and the stranger, and the fatherlesse, and the widowe, which are within thy gates, and shall eate, and be filled, that the Lord thy God may blesse thee in al the worke of thine hand which thou doest.

## Deuteronomy 15

1. At the terme of seuen yeeres thou shalt make a freedome.

2. And this [is] the manner of the release: Every 

3. Of a stranger thou mayest require it: but that which thou hast with thy brother, thine hand shall remit:

4. 
          

5. So that thou hearken vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God to obserue and doe all these commandements, which I commande thee this day.

6. For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, as he hath promised thee: and thou shalt lend vnto many nations, but thou thy selfe shalt not borow, and thou shalt reigne ouer many nations, & they shall not reigne ouer thee.

7. If one of thy brethren with thee be poore within any of thy gates in thy land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poore brother:

8. But thou shalt open thine hand vnto him, and shalt lend him sufficient for his neede which he hath.

9. Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thine heart, to say, The seuenth yeere, the yeere of freedome is at hand: therefore it grieueth thee to looke on thy poore brother, and thou giuest him nought, and he crie vnto the Lorde against thee, so that sinne be in thee:

10. Thou shalt giue him, and let it not grieue thine heart to giue vnto him: for because of this the Lord thy God shal blesse thee in al thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand to.

11. 
          

12. If thy brother an Ebrewe sell himselfe to thee, or an Ebrewesse, and serue thee sixe yeere, euen in the seuenth yeere thou shalt let him goe free from thee:

13. And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him goe away emptie,

14. Thou shalt 

15. And remember that thou wast a seruant in the land of Egypt, & the Lord thy God deliuered thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.

16. And if he say vnto thee, I will not go away from thee, because he loueth thee & thine house, and because he is well with thee,

17. Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust [it] through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant 

18. It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double 

19. All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: 

20. Thou shalt eate it before the Lord thy God yeere by yeere, in the place which the Lord shall chose, both thou, and thine household.

21. But if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or haue any euill fault, thou shalt not offer it vnto the Lord thy God,

22. Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean [person shall eat it] alike, 

23. Onely thou shalt not eate the blood thereof, but powre it vpon the ground as water.

## Deuteronomy 16

1. Observe the month of

And thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God, thou and thy sonne, and thy daughter, and thy seruant, and thy maide, and the Leuite that is within thy gates, & the stranger, & the fatherles, and the widowe, that are among you, in the place which the Lorde thy God shall chuse to place his Name there,

12. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a seruant in Egypt: therefore thou shalt obserue and doe these ordinances.

13. Thou shalt 

14. And thou shalt reioyce in thy feast, thou, and thy sonne, and thy daughter, and thy seruant, & thy maid, & the Leuite, & the stranger, & the fatherlesse, and the widow, that are wtin thy gates.

15. Seuen daies shalt thou keepe a feast vnto the Lorde thy God in the place which the Lorde shall chuse: when the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all thine increase, and in all the workes of thine hands, thou shalt in any case be glad.

16. Three times in the yeere shall all the males appeare before the Lorde thy God in the place which he shall chuse: in the feast of the vnleauened bread, and in the feast of the weekes, and in the feast of the Tabernacles: and they shall not appeare before the Lord emptie.

17. Every man [shall give] as he is

6. At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he that is woorthie of death, die: but at the mouth of one witnesse, he shall not die.

7. The hands of the

28. And ye Lorde shal smite thee with madnes, and with blindnes, and with astonying of heart.

29. And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the

38. Thou shalt carie out much seede into the fielde, and shalt gather but litle in: for the grashoppers shall destroy it.

39. Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dresse it, but shalt neither drinke of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the wormes shall eate it.

40. Thou shalt haue Oliue trees in all thy coastes, but shalt not anoynt thy selfe with the oyle: for thine oliues shall fall.

49. The Lord shall bring a nation vpon thee from farre, euen from the ende of the world, flying swift as an Egle: a nation whose tongue thou shalt not vnderstand:

50. A nation of a fierce countenance, which will not regarde the person of the olde, nor haue compassion of the yong.

51. The same shall eate the fruit of thy cattell, and the fruite of thy land vntill thou be destroyed, and he shall leaue thee neyther wheate, wine, nor oyle, neither the increase of thy kyne, nor the flockes of thy sheepe, vntill he haue brought thee to nought.

52. And he shall besiege thee in all thy cities, vntill thine hie and strong walles fall downe, wherein thou trustedst in all the lande: and hee shall besiege thee in all thy cities throughout all thy lande, which the Lorde thy God hath giuen thee.

53. And thou shalt eate the fruite of thy bodie: euen the flesh of thy sonnes and thy daughters, which the Lorde thy God hath giuen thee, during the siege & straitnesse wherein thine enemie shall inclose thee:

54. So that the man (that is tender and exceeding deintie among you) shalbe grieued at his brother, and at his wife, that lieth in his bosome, and at the remnant of his children, which hee hath yet left,

55. For feare of giuing vnto any of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eate, because he hath nothing left him in that siege, and straitnesse, wherewith thine enemie shall besiege thee in all thy cities.

61. Also every sickness, and every plague, which [is] not

67. In the morning thou shalt say, Woulde God it were euening, and at the euening thou shalt say, Would God it were morning, for ye feare of thine heart, which thou shalt feare, and for the sight of thine eyes, which thou shalt see.

16. For ye knowe, how we haue dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we passed thorowe the middes of the nations, which ye passed by.

17. And ye haue seene their abominations and their idoles (wood, and stone, siluer and golde) which were among them,

24. Then shall all nations say, Wherefore hath the Lorde done thus vnto this lande? how fierce is this great wrath?

25. And they shall answere, Because they haue forsaken the couenant of the Lorde God of their fathers, which he had made with them, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,

26. And went and serued other gods and worshipped them: euen gods which they knewe not, and which had giuen them nothing,

17. Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will
