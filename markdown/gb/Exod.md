## Exodus 1

1. Now 

2. Reuben, Simeon, Leui, and Iudah,

3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Beniamin,

4. Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

5. So al the soules, that came out of the loines of Iaakob, were seuentie soules: Ioseph was in Egypt already.

6. Nowe Ioseph died and all his brethren, and that whole generation.

7. And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the 

8. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which 

9. And he sayde vnto his people, Beholde, the people of the children of Israel are greater and mightier then we.

10. Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] 

11. Therefore did they set taskemasters ouer them, to keepe the vnder with burdens: and they built the cities Pithom and Raamses for the treasures of Pharaoh.

12. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And 

13. Wherefore the Egyptians by crueltie caused the children of Israel to serue.

14. Thus they made them weary of their liues by sore labour in clay & in bricke, & in al worke in the fielde, with all maner of bondage, which they layde vpon them most cruelly.

15. And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] 

16. And sayde, When ye doe the office of a midwife to the women of the Ebrewes, and see them on their stooles, if it be a sonne, then yee shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then let her liue.

17. Notwithstanding ye midwiues feared God, and did not as the King of Egypt commaunded them, but preserued aliue the men children.

18. Then the King of Egypt called for the midwiues, and sayde vnto them, Why haue yee done thus, and haue preserued aliue the men children?

19. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew 

20. God therefore prospered the midwiues, and the people multiplied and were very mightie.

21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he

1. And there went a 

2. And the woman coceiued and bare a sonne: and when she saw that he was faire, she hid him three moneths.

3. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and 

4. Now his sister stood a farre off, to wit what would come of him.

5. Then ye daughter of Pharaoh came downe to wash her in the riuer, and her maidens walked by the riuers side: and when shee sawe the arke among the bulrushes, she sent her maide to fet it.

6. Then she opened it, and sawe it was a childe: and beholde, the babe wept: so she had compassion on it, and sayde, This is one of the Ebrewes children.

7. Then said his sister vnto Pharaohs daughter, Shall I go and cal vnto thee a nurce of the Ebrew women to nurce thee the childe?

8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the 

9. To whome Pharaohs daughter sayde, Take this childe away, and nurce it for me, and I wil reward thee. Then the woman tooke the childe and nurced him.

10. Nowe the childe grewe, and she brought him vnto Pharaohs daughter, and he was as her sonne, and she called his name Moses, because, said she, I drewe him out of the water.

11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was 

12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he 

13. Againe he came forth the second day, and behold, two Ebrewes stroue: and he said vnto him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellowe?

14. And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses 

15. Now Pharaoh heard this matter, & sought to slay Moses: therefore Moses fled from Pharaoh, and dwelt in the lande of Midian, and hee sate downe by a well.

16. And the Priest of Midian had seue daughters, which came and drewe water, and filled the troghes, for to water their fathers sheepe.

17. Then the shepherds came and droue them away: but Moses rose vp and defended them, and watered their sheepe.

18. And whe they came to Reuel their father, he said, Howe are ye come so soone to day?

19. And they saide, A man of Egypt deliuered vs from the hand of the shepherdes, and also drew vs water ynough, and watered the sheepe.

20. And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? 

21. And Moses agreed to dwell with the man: who gaue vnto Moses Zipporah his daughter:

22. And she bare a sonne, whose name he called Gershom: for he said, I haue bene a stranger in a strange lande.

23. And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they 

24. Then God heard their mone, and God remembred his couenant with Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob.

25. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had 

## Exodus 3

1. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the

4. And when the

6. Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was 

7. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which [are] in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their 

8. And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land 

9. 
          

10. Come now therefore, and I will send thee vnto Pharaoh, that thou maiest bring my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

11. And Moses said unto God, Who [am] 

12. And he said, 

13. Then Moses said vnto God, Behold, when I shall come vnto the children of Israel, and shall say vnto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me vnto you: if they say vnto me, What is his Name? What shall I say vnto them?

14. And God said unto Moses, I 

15. And God spake further vnto Moses, Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel, The Lorde God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Izhak, and the God of Iaakob hath sent me vnto you: this is my Name for euer, and this is my memoriall vnto all ages.

16. Go & gather the Elders of Israel together, & thou shalt say vnto the, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Izhak, & Iaakob appeared vnto me, & said, I haue surely remembred you, & that which is done to you in Egypt.

17. Therefore I did say, I wil bring you out of the affliction of Egypt vnto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, vnto a lande that floweth with milke and honie.

18. And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may 

19. But I know, that the King of Egypt wil not let you goe, but by strong hande.

20. Therefore will I stretch out mine hande and smite Egypt with all my wonders, which I will doe in the middes thereof: and after that shall he let you goe.

21. And I will make this people to be fauoured of the Egyptians: so that when ye go, ye shal not goe emptie.

22. 
          

## Exodus 4

1. And Moses answered and said, 

2. And the Lord said vnto him, What is that in thine hande? And he answered, A rod.

3. Then said he, Cast it on the ground. So he cast it on the grounde, and it was turned into a serpent: and Moses fled from it.

4. Againe the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Put foorth thine hand, and take it by the tayle. Then he put foorth his hande and caught it, and it was turned into a rod in his hand.

5. 
          

6. And the Lorde saide furthermore vnto him, Thrust nowe thine hand into thy bosome; he thrust his hand into his bosome, & when he tooke it out againe, behold, his hand was leprous as snowe.

7. Moreouer he said, Put thine hand into thy bosome againe. So he put his hande into his bosome againe, & pluckt it out of his bosome, and behold, it was turned againe as his other flesh.

8. So shall it be, if they wil not beleeue thee, neither obey the voyce of ye first signe, yet shall they beleeue for the voyce of the seconde signe.

9. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the 

10. But Moses said vnto the Lorde, Oh my Lorde, I am not eloquent, neither at any time haue bene, nor yet since thou hast spoken vnto thy seruant: but I am slowe of speach & slowe of tongue.

11. Then the Lorde said vnto him, Who hath giuen the mouth to man? or who hath made the domme, or the deafe, or him that seeth, or the blinde? haue not I the Lorde?

12. Therefore goe nowe, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say.

13. And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand [of him whom] thou 

14. And the 

15. And thou shalt speak unto him, and 

16. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, [even] he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of 

17. Moreouer thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do miracles.

18. Therefore Moses went and returned to Iethro his father in lawe, & said vnto him, I pray thee, let me goe, and returne to my brethren, which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet aliue. Then Iethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

19. (For the Lord had said vnto Moses in Midian, Goe, returne to Egypt: for they are all dead which went about to kill thee)

20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the 

21. And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will 

22. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel [is] my son, [even] my 

23. Wherefore I say to thee, Let my sonne go, that he may serue me: if thou refuse to let him goe, beholde, I will slay thy sonne, euen thy first borne.

24. And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and 

25. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and 

26. So he departed from him. Then she saide, O bloodie husbande (because of the circumcision)

27. Then the Lorde saide vnto Aaron, Goe meete Moses in the wildernesse; he went and mette him in the Mount of God, and kissed him.

28. Then Moses tolde Aaron all the wordes of the Lord, who had sent him, and all the signes wherewith he had charged him.

29. So went Moses and Aaron, and gathered all the Elders of the children of Israel.

30. And Aaron told all the wordes, which the Lorde had spoken vnto Moses, and he did the miracles in the sight of the people,

31. And the 

## Exodus 5

1. And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told 

2. And Pharaoh saide, Who is the Lorde, that I should heare his voyce, & let Israel go? I knowe not the Lord, neither will I let Israel goe.

3. And they saide, We worship the God of the Ebrewes: we pray thee, let vs goe three daies iourney in the desert, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God, least he bring vpon vs the pestilence or sword.

4. Then saide the King of Egypt vnto them, Moses & Aaron, why cause ye the people to cease from their workes? get you to your burdens.

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and ye 

6. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their 

7. Ye shall giue the people no more strawe, to make bricke ( as in time past) but let them goe and gather them strawe them selues:

8. Notwithstanding lay vpon them the nober of bricke, which they made in time past, diminish nothing thereof: for they be idle, therefore they crie, saying, Let vs go to offer sacrifice vnto our God.

9. 
          

10. Then went the taskemasters of the people and their officers out, and tolde the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will giue you no more strawe.

11. Goe your selues, get you strawe where yee can finde it, yet shall nothing of your labour bee diminished.

12. Then were the people scattered abroade throughout all the land of Egypt, for to gather stubble in steade of strawe.

13. And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Finish your dayes worke euery dayes taske, as ye did when ye had strawe.

14. And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaohs taskemasters had set ouer them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore haue ye not fulfilled your taske in making bricke yesterday and to daye, as in times past?

15. Then the officers of the children of Israel came, & cryed vnto Pharaoh, saying, Wherfore dealest thou thus with thy seruants?

16. There is no strawe giuen to thy seruantes, and they say vnto vs, Make bricke: and loe, thy seruants are beaten, and thy people is blamed.

17. But he said, Ye are to much idle: therfore ye say, Let vs goe to offer sacrifice to the Lord.

18. Goe therefore nowe and worke: for there shall no strawe be giuen you, yet shall yee deliuer the whole tale of bricke.

19. Then the officers of the children of Israel sawe them selues in an euill case, because it was saide, Ye shall diminish nothing of your bricke, nor of euery dayes taske.

20. And they met Moses and Aaron, which stood in their way as they came out fro Pharaoh,

21. And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to 

22. Wherefore Moses returned to the Lorde, and saide, Lorde, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou thus sent me?

23. For since I came to Pharaoh to speake in thy Name, he hath vexed this people, and yet thou hast not deliuered thy people.

## Exodus 6

1. Then the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Nowe shalt thou see, what I will doe vnto Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them goe, and euen be constrained to driue them out of his land.

2. Moreouer God spake vnto Moses, and sayd vnto him, I am the Lord,

3. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by [the name of] God Almighty, but by my name 

4. Furthermore as I made my couenant with them to giue them ye land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers:

5. So I haue also hearde the groning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keepe in bondage, and haue remembred my couenant.

6. Wherefore say thou vnto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out fro the burdens of the Egyptians, & will deliuer you out of their bondage, and will redeeme you in a stretched out arme, and in great iudgements.

7. And I will 

8. And I will bring you into the land which I sware that I woulde giue to Abraham, to Izhak, and to Iaakob, and I will giue it vnto you for a possession: I am the Lord.

9. And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened 

10. Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

11. Go speak to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel goe out of his land.

12. And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who [am] of 

13. Then the Lord spake vnto Moses & vnto Aaron, & charged them to goe to the children of Israel & to Pharaoh King of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the lande of Egypt.

14. These [be] the heads 

15. Also the sonnes of Simeon: Iemuel and Iamin, and Ohad, and Iachin, and Zoar, and Shaul the sonne of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.

16. And these [are] the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi [were] an hundred 

17. The sonnes of Gershon were Libni and Shimi by their families.

18. And the sonnes of Kohath, Amram and Izhar, and Hebron, & Vzziel. (and Kohath liued an hundreth thirtie and three yeere)

19. Also the sonnes of Merari were Mahali & Mushi: these are ye families of Leui by their kinreds.

20. And Amram took him Jochebed his 

21. And the sons of Izhar; 

22. And the sonnes of Vzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.

23. And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of 

24. Also the sonnes of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.

25. And Eleazar Aarons sonne tooke him one of the daughters of Putiel to his wife, which bare him Phinehas: these are the principall fathers of the Leuites throughout their families.

26. These [are] that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their 

27. These are that Moses and Aaron, which spake to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that they might bring the children of Israel out of Egypt.

28. And at that time when the Lorde spake vnto Moses in the land of Egypt,

29. When the Lorde, I say, spake vnto Moses, saying, I am the Lord, speake thou vnto Pharaoh the King of Egypt all that I say vnto thee,

30. And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I [am] of 

## Exodus 7

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a 

2. Thou shalt speake all that I commaunded thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speake vnto Pharaoh, that he suffer the children of Israel to go out of his land.

3. But I will harden Pharaohs heart, and multiplie my miracles and my wonders in the lande of Egypt.

4. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, [and] my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great 

5. Then the Egyptians shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I stretch foorth mine hand vpon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

6. So Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, euen so did they.

7. And Moses [was] 

8. And the Lorde had spoken vnto Moses and Aaron, saying,

9. If Pharaoh speake vnto you, saying, Shewe a miracle for you, then thou shalt say vnto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shalbe turned into a serpent.

10. Then went Moses and Aaron vnto Pharaoh, and did euen as the Lord had commaunded: and Aaron cast forth his rod before Pharaoh and before his seruants, & it was turned into a serpent.

11. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the 

12. For they cast downe euery man his rod, & they were turned into serpents: but Aarons rodde deuoured their rods.

13. So Pharaohs heart was hardened, and hee hearkened not to them, as the Lorde had saide.

14. The Lorde then saide vnto Moses, Pharaohs heart is obstinate, hee refuseth to let the people goe.

15. Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by 

16. And thou shalt say vnto him, The Lorde God of the Ebrewes hath sent me vnto thee, saying, Let my people goe, that they may serue mee in the wildernesse: and beholde, hitherto thou wouldest not heare.

17. Thus saith the Lorde, In this shalt thou know that I am the Lord: behold, I wil smite with the rodde that is in mine hand vpon the water that is in the riuer, and it shalbe turned to blood.

18. And the fish that is in the riuer shall dye, and the riuer shall stinke, and it shall grieue the Egyptians to drinke of the water of the riuer.

19. The Lord then spake to Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand ouer the waters of Egypt, ouer their streames, ouer their riuers, & ouer their pondes,, and ouer all pooles of their waters, and they shalbe blood, and there shalbe blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and of stone.

20. So Moses and Aaron did euen as the Lord commaunded: and hee lift vp the rodde, and smote the water that was in the riuer in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his seruants: and all the water that was in the riuer, was turned into blood.

21. And the 

22. And the magicians of Egypt did 

23. Then Pharaoh returned, and went againe into his house, neither did this yet enter into his heart.

24. All the Egyptians then digged rounde about the riuer for waters to drinke: for they could not drinke of the water of the riuer.

25. And this continued fully seuen dayes after the Lord had smitten the riuer.

## Exodus 8

1. Afterward the Lorde sayde vnto Moses, Goe vnto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde, Let my people goe, that they may serue me:

2. And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with 

3. And the riuer shal scral ful of frogges, which shall goe vp and come into thine house, and into thy chamber, where thou sleepest, and vpon thy bed, and into the house of thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine ouens, and into thy kneading troughes.

4. Yea, the frogges shall climbe vp vpon thee, and on thy people, and vpon all thy seruants.

5. Also the Lord said vnto Moses, Say thou vnto Aaron, Stretch out thine hande with thy rod vpon the streames, vpon the riuers, and vpon the ponds, and cause frogs to come vp vpon the land of Egypt.

6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of 

7. And the sorcerers did likewise with their sorceries, and brought frogges vp vpon the land of Egypt.

8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, 

9. And Moses said vnto Pharaoh, Concerning me, euen command when I shall pray for thee, and for thy seruants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogges from thee and from thine houses, that they may remaine in the riuer only.

10. Then he said, To morowe; he answered, Be it as thou hast said, that thou maiest know, that there is none like vnto the Lord our God.

11. So the frogges shall depart from thee, and from thine houses, and from thy seruantes, and from thy people: onely they shall remaine in the riuer.

12. Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cryed vnto the Lorde concerning the frogges, which hee had sent vnto Pharaoh.

13. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs 

14. And they gathered the together by heaps, and the land stanke of them.

15. But when Pharaoh sawe that hee had rest giuen him, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said.

16. Againe the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretche out the rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may bee turned to lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.

17. And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth: and lyce came vpon man and vpon beast: all the dust of the earth was lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.

18. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they 

19. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This [is] 

20. Moreouer the Lorde sayd to Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh (lo, hee will come forth vnto the water) and say vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serue me.

21. Els, if thou wilt not let my people goe, behold, I will send swarmes of flies both vpon thee, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shalbe full of swarmes of flies, and the ground also whereon they are.

22. But ye land of Goshe, where my people are, wil I cause to be wonderfull in that day, so that no swarmes of flies shalbe there, that thou maiest know that I am the Lorde in the middes of the earth.

23. And I will make a deliuerance of my people from thy people: to morowe shall this miracle be.

24. And the Lorde did so: for there came great swarmes of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his seruants houses, so that through all the lande of Egypt, the earth was corrupt by the swarmes of flies.

25. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and saide, Goe, doe sacrifice vnto your God in this lande.

26. And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the 

27. Let vs go three dayes iourney in the desert, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God, as he hath commanded vs.

28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not 

29. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal 

30. So Moses went out from Pharaoh & prayed vnto the Lorde.

31. And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses, and the swarmes of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people, and there remained not one.

32. And Pharaoh 

## Exodus 9

1. Then the Lorde said vnto Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde God of the Ebrewes, Let my people go, that they may serue me.

2. But if thou refuse to let them goe, and wilt yet holde them still,

3. Beholde, the hande of the Lorde is vpon thy flocke which is in the fielde: for vpon the horses, vpon the asses, vpon the camels, vpon the cattell, and vpon the sheepe shalbe a mightie great moraine.

4. And the LORD shall 

5. And the Lord appointed a time, saying, To morowe the Lorde shall finish this thing in this lande.

6. So the Lord did this thing on the morow, and all the cattel of Egypt dyed: but of the cattell of the children of Israel dyed not one.

7. And Pharaoh 

8. And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take your handfull of ashes of the fornace, and Moses shall sprinkle them towarde the heauen in the sight of Pharaoh,

9. And they shall be turned to dust in all the land of Egypt: and it shalbe as a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast, thorow out all the land of Egypt.

10. Then they tooke ashes of the fornace, and stoode before Pharaoh: and Moses sprinkled them towarde the heauen, and there came a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast.

11. And the sorcerers could not stande before Moses, because of the scab: for the scab was vpon the enchanters, and vpon all the Egyptians.

12. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had said vnto Moses.

13. Also the Lorde said vnto Moses, Rise vp early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde God of the Ebrewes, Let my people goe, that they may serue me.

14. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon 

15. For nowe I will stretch out mine hande, that I may smite thee and thy people with the pestilence: and thou shalt perish from the earth.

16. And in very deed for this [cause] have I raised thee up, for to shew [in] thee my power; and that my 

17. Yet thou exaltest thy selfe against my people, and lettest them not goe.

18. Beholde, to morowe this time I will cause to raine a mightie great haile, such as was not in Egypt since the foundation thereof was laid vnto this time.

19. Send therefore now, [and] 

20. Such then as feared the word of the Lorde among the seruants of Pharaoh, made his seruants and his cattell flee into the houses:

21. And he that regarded not the 

22. And the Lorde saide to Moses, Stretche foorth thine hande towarde heauen, that there may be haile in all the land of Egypt, vpon man, and vpon beast, and vpon all the herbes of the fielde in the lande of Egypt.

23. Then Moses stretched out his rod towarde heauen, & the Lord sent thunder and haile, and lightening vpon the ground: and the Lorde caused haile to raine vpon the land of Egypt.

24. So there was haile, and fire mingled with the haile, so grieuous, as there was none throughout all the lande of Egypt, since it was a nation.

25. And the haile smote throughout al ye land of Egypt all that was in the fielde, both man and beast: also ye haile smote all the herbes of ye field, and brake to pieces all the trees of the fielde.

26. Onely in the lande of Goshen (where the children of Israel were) was no haile.

27. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I 

28. Pray ye vnto the Lorde (for it is ynough) that there be no more mightie thunders and haile, and I will let you goe, and yee shall tarie no longer.

29. Then Moses saide vnto him, Assoone as I am out of the citie, I will spreade mine hands vnto the Lorde, and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more haile, that thou mayest knowe that the earth is the Lordes.

30. But as for thee and thy servants, 

31. (And the flaxe, & the barley were smitten: for the barley was eared, & the flaxe was bolled.

32. But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were hid in the grounde)

33. Then Moses went out of the citie from Pharaoh, and spred his hands to the Lorde, and the thunder and the haile ceased, neither rained it vpon the earth.

34. And when Pharaoh sawe that the raine and the haile and the thunder were ceased, hee sinned againe, and hardened his heart, both he, and his seruants.

35. So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened: neither would he let the children of Israel goe, as the Lord had said by Moses.

## Exodus 10

1. Againe the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Goe to Pharaoh: for I haue hardened his heart, and the heart of his seruants, that I might worke these my miracles in the middes of his realme,

2. And that thou mayest tell in the 

3. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse 

4. But if thou refuse to let my people go, beholde, to morowe will I bring grashoppers into thy coastes.

5. And they shall couer the face of the earth, that a man can not see the earth: and they shall eate the residue which remaineth vnto you, and hath escaped from the haile: and they shall eate all your trees that bud in the fielde.

6. And they shall fil thine houses, and all thy seruants houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers haue seene, since the time they were vpon the earth vnto this day. So he returned, and went out from Pharaoh.

7. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a 

8. So Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh, and he saide vnto them, Goe, serue the Lorde your God, but who are they that shall goe?

9. And Moses answered, We will go with our yong and with our olde, with our sonnes and with our daughters, with our sheepe and with our cattell will we goe: for we must celebrate a feast vnto the Lorde.

10. And he said unto them, Let 

11. It shall not be so: nowe goe ye that are men, and serue the Lorde: for that was your desire. Then they were thrust out from Pharaohs presence.

12. After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hande vpon the lande of Egypt for the grashoppers, that they may come vpon the lande of Egypt, and eate all the herbes of the land, euen all that the haile hath left.

13. Then Moses stretched foorth his rod vpon the lande of Egypt: and the Lorde brought an East winde vpon the land all that day, and al that night: and in the morning the East wind brought the grashoppers.

14. So the grashoppers went vp vpon all the land of Egypt, and remained in all quarters of Egypt: so grieuous Grashoppers, like to these were neuer before, neither after them shalbe such.

15. For they couered all the face of the earth, so that the lande was darke: and they did eate all the herbes of the lande, and all the fruites of the trees, which the haile had left, so that there was no greene thing left vpon the trees, nor among the herbes of the fielde throughout all the lande of Egypt.

16. Then Pharaoh called for 

17. And nowe forgiue mee my sinne onely this once, and pray vnto the Lord your God, that hee may take away from me this death onely.

18. Moses then went out from Pharaoh, and prayed vnto the Lord.

19. And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the 

20. But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, & hee did not let the children of Israel goe.

21. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be 

22. Then Moses stretched forth his hande towarde heauen, and there was a blacke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three daies.

23. No man saw an other, neither rose vp from ye place where he was for three dayes: but all the children of Israel had light where they dwelt.

24. The Pharaoh called for Moses & said, Go, serue the Lord: onely your sheepe and your cattel shall abide, and your children shall go with you.

25. And Moses sayd, Thou must giue vs also sacrifices, and burnt offrings that wee may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord our God.

26. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an 

27. (But the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them goe)

28. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in [that] day thou seest my face thou shalt 

29. Then Moses said, Thou hast said wel: from henceforth will I see thy face no more.

## Exodus 11

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague [more] upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let [you] go, he shall 

2. Speake thou nowe to the people, that euery man require of his neighbour, & euery woman of her neighbour iewels of siluer & iewels of gold.

3. And the Lorde gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: also Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohs seruantes, and in the sight of the people.)

4. Also Moses sayde, Thus sayth the Lord, About midnight will I goe out into the middes of Egypt.

5. And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that [is] behind 

6. Then there shalbe a great crie throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was neuer none like, nor shalbe.

7. But against none of ye children of Israel shal a dogge moue his tongue, neyther against man nor beast, that ye may knowe that the Lord putteth a differece betweene the Egyptians & Israel.

8. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that 

9. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; 

10. So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: but the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he suffred not the children of Israel to goe out of his lande.

## Exodus 12

1. Then the Lord spake to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2. This 

3. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of [their] 

4. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the number of the souls; every man according to his 

5. Your lambe shalbe without blemish, a male of a yeere olde: ye shall take it of the lambes, or of the kiddes.

6. And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the 

7. After, they shall take of the blood, & strike it on the two postes, and on the vpper doore post of the houses where they shall eate it.

8. And they shal eate the flesh the same night, roste with fire, and vnleauened bread: with sowre herbes they shall eate it.

9. Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast [with] fire; his 

10. And ye shal reserue nothing of it vnto the morning: but that, which remaineth of it vnto the morowe, shall ye burne with fire.

11. And thus shall ye eat it; [with] your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: 

12. For I will passe through the lande of Egypt the same night, and will smite all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and I will execute iudgement vpon all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord.

13. And the blood shalbe a toke for you vpon the houses where ye are: so when I see the blood, I will passe ouer you, and the plague shall not be vpon you to destruction, when I smite the lande of Egypt.

14. And this day shall be unto you for a 

15. Seuen daies shall ye eat vnleauened bread, and in any case ye shall put away leauen the first day out of your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread from the first daie vntill the seuenth day, that person shalbe cut off from Israel.

16. And in the first day shalbe an holie assemblie: also in the seuenth day shalbe an holy assemblie vnto you: no worke shalbe done in them, saue about that which euery man must eate: that onely may ye do.

17. Ye shall keepe also the feast of vnleauened bread: for that same daye I will bring your armies out of the lande of Egypt: therefore ye shal obserue this day, throughout your posteritie, by an ordinance for euer.

18. In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at 

19. Seuen daies shall no leauen be founde in your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread, that person shalbe cut off from the Congregation of Israel: whether he bee a stranger, or borne in the land.

20. Ye shall eate no leauened bread: but in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread.

21. Then Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and saide vnto them, Choose out and take you for euerie of your housholdes a lambe, & kill the Passeouer.

22. And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basen, and strike the lintell, and the doore cheekes with the blood that is in the basen, and let none of you goe out at the doore of his house, vntill the morning.

23. For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the 

24. Therefore shall ye obserue this thing as an ordinance both for thee and thy sonnes for euer.

25. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the 

26. And when your children aske you, What seruice is this ye keepe?

27. That ye shall say, It [is] the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people 

28. So the children of Israel went, and did as the Lorde had commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they.

29. Nowe at midnight, the Lorde smote all the first borne in the lande of Egypt, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne, vnto the first borne of the captiue that was in prison, and all the first borne of beastes.

30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for [there was] 

31. And hee called to Moses and to Aaron by night, and saide, Rise vp, get you out from among my people, both yee, and the children of Israel, and goe serue the Lorde as ye haue sayde.

32. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and 

33. And the Egyptians did force the people, because they would send them out of the land in haste: for they said, We die all.

34. Therfore the people tooke their dough before it was leauened, euen their dough bound in clothes vpon their shoulders.

35. And the children of Israel did according to the saying of Moses, & they asked of ye Egyptians iewels of siluer & iewels of gold, & raiment.

36. And the Lorde gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: and they graunted their request: so they spoyled the Egyptians.

37. And the children of Israel journeyed from 

38. And 

39. And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt, & made vnleauened cakes: for it was not leauened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, neither coulde they tarie, nor yet prepare themselues vitailes.

40. So the dwelling of the children of Israel, while they dwelled in Egypt, was foure hundreth and thirtie yeres.

41. And it came to pass at the end of the 

42. It is a night to be kept holie to the Lord, because he brought them out of the lande of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord, which all the children of Israel must keepe throughout their generations.

43. And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This [is] the ordinance of the passover: 

44. But euerie seruant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

45. A stranger or an hyred seruant shall not eat thereof.

46. In one house shall it bee eaten: thou shalt carie none of ye flesh out of the house, neither shall ye breake a bone thereof.

47. All the Congregation of Israel shall obserue it.

48. But if a stranger dwell with thee, and will obserue the Passeouer of the Lorde, let him circumcise all the males, that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obserue it, & he shall be as one that is borne in the land: for none vncircumcised person shall eate thereof.

49. One 

50. Then all the children of Israel did as the Lorde commaunded Moses and Aaron: so did they.

51. And the selfe same day did the Lord bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

## Exodus 13

1. And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne: that is, euery one that first openeth the wombe among the children of Israel, as well of man as of beast: for it is mine.

3. And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of 

4. This day came ye out in the month 

5. Now when the Lord hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Hiuites, and Iebusites (which he sware vnto thy fathers, that he woulde giue thee, a land flowing with milke and honie) then thou shalt keepe this seruice in this moneth.

6. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the 

7. Vnleauened bread shall bee eaten seuen dayes, and there shal no leauened bread be seene with thee, nor yet leauen be seene with thee in all thy quarters.

8. And thou shalt shew thy son 

9. And it shall be for a sign unto thee 

10. Keepe therefore this ordinance in his season appoynted from yeere to yeere.

11. And when the Lord shall bring thee into the lande of the Canaanites, as hee sware vnto thee and to thy fathers, and shall giue it thee,

12. Then thou shalt set apart vnto the Lorde all that first openeth the wombe: also euery thing that first doeth open the wombe, and commeth forth of thy beast: the males shalbe the Lordes.

13. And every firstling of an 

14. And when thy sonne shall aske thee to morowe, saying, What is this? thou shalt then say vnto him, With a mightie hande the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

15. For when Pharaoh was harde hearted against our departing, the Lord then slewe all the first borne in the lande of Egypt: from the first borne of man euen to the first borne of beast: therefore I sacrifice vnto the Lorde all the males that first open the wombe, but all the first borne of my sonnes I redeeme.

16. And it shalbe as a token vpon thine hand, and as frontlets betweene thine eyes, that the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt by a mightie hande.

17. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they 

18. But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up 

19. (And Moses tooke the bones of Ioseph with him: for he had made the children of Israel sweare, saying, God will surely visite you, and ye shal take my bones away hence with you)

20. So they tooke their iourney from Succoth, and camped in Etham in the edge of the wildernesse.

21. And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a 

22. He tooke not away the pillar of ye cloude by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.

## Exodus 14

1. Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they 

3. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are tangled in the land: the wildernesse hath shut them in.

4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will 

5. Then it was told the King of Egypt, that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his seruants was turned against the people, and they sayde, Why haue we this done, and haue let Israel go out of our seruice?

6. And he made ready his charets, and tooke his people with him,

7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and 

8. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an 

9. And the Egyptians pursued after them, and all the horses and charets of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his hoste ouertooke them camping by the Sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

10. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore 

11. And they sayde vnto Moses, Hast thou brought vs to die in the wildernes, because there were no graues in Egypt? wherefore hast thou serued vs thus, to carie vs out of Egypt?

12. [Is] not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let 

13. Then Moses sayde to the people, Feare ye not, stand still, and beholde the saluation of the Lord which he will shew to you this day. For the Egyptians, whome ye haue seene this day, ye shall neuer see them againe.

14. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall 

15. And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore 

16. And lift thou vp thy rod, and stretche out thine hand vpon the Sea and deuide it, and let the children of Israel goe on drie ground thorow the middes of the Sea.

17. And I, beholde, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, that they may followe them, and I wil get me honour vpon Pharaoh, & vpon all his host, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen.

18. Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lorde, when I haue gotten me honour vpon Pharaoh, vpon his charets, & vpon his horsemen.

19. (And the Angel of God, which went before the hoste of Israel, remoued & went behinde them: also the pillar of the cloude went from before them, and stoode behinde them,

20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them], but it gave 

21. And Moses stretched forth his hande vpon the Sea, & the Lord caused the sea to runne backe by a strong East winde all the night, & made the Sea dry land: for the waters were deuided.

22. Then the children of Israel went through the middes of the Sea vpon the drie ground, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hand, and on their left hand.

23. And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the middes of the Sea, euen all Pharaohs horses, his charets, and his horsemen.

24. And it came to pass, that in the morning 

25. For he tooke off their charet wheeles, and they draue them with much a doe: so that the Egyptians euery one sayd, I wil flee from the face of Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

26. Then the Lord sayde to Moses, Stretche thine hand vpon the Sea, that the waters may returne vpon the Egyptians, vpon their charets and vpon their horsemen.

27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD 

28. So the water returned & couered the charets and the horsemen, euen all the hoste of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them: there remained not one of them.

29. But the children of Israel walked vpon dry land thorowe the middes of the Sea, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hande, and on their left.

30. Thus the Lorde saued Israel the same day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel sawe the Egyptians dead vpon the Sea banke.

31. And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his

5. The depths haue couered them, they sanke to the bottome as a stone.

6. Thy right hande, O Lorde, is glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lorde, hath brused the enemie.

7. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against 

8. And by the blast of thy nostrels the waters were gathered, the floods stoode still as an heape, the depthes congealed together in the heart of the Sea.

9. The enemie sayd, I wil pursue, I wil ouertake them, I will deuide the spoyle, my lust shall bee satisfied vpon them, I will drawe my sworde, mine hand shall destroy them.

10. Thou blewest with thy winde, the Sea couered them, they sanke as leade in the mightie waters.

11. Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the 

12. Thou stretchedst out thy right hande, the earth swallowed them.

13. Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thy strength unto thy holy 

14. The people shal heare and be afraide: sorow shal come vpon the inhabitants of Palestina.

15. Then the dukes of Edom shalbe amased, & trembling shall come vpon the great men of Moab: all the inhabitantes of Canaan shall waxe faint hearted.

16. Feare and dread shall fall vpon them: because of the greatnesse of thine arme, they shalbe stil as a stone, till thy people passe, O Lord: til this people passe, which thou hast purchased.

17. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine 

18. The Lord shall reigne for euer and euer.

19. For Pharaohs horses went with his charets and horsemen into the Sea, and the Lorde brought the waters of the Sea vpon them: but the children of Israel went on drie land in the middes of the Sea.

20. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with

22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of 

23. And whe they came to Marah, they could not drinke of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of the place was called Marah.

24. Then the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drinke?

25. And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, [which] when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there 

26. And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is 

27. And they came to Elim, where were twelue fountaines of water, and seuentie palme trees, and they camped thereby the waters.

## Exodus 16

1. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of 

2. And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses & against Aaron in the wildernesse.

3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh 

4. Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every 

5. But the sixt daye they shall prepare that, which they shal bring home, and it shalbe twise as much as they gather dayly.

6. Then Moses and Aaron sayde vnto all the children of Israel, At euen ye shal know, that the Lord brought you out of the land of Egypt:

7. And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; 

8. And Moses said, [This shall be], when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what [are] we? your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the 

9. And Moses sayd to Aaron, Say vnto all the Congregation of the children of Israel, Draw neere before the Lorde: for he hath heard your murmurings.

10. Now as Aaron spake vnto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wildernesse, and beholde, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloude.

11. (For the Lorde had spoken vnto Moses, saying,

12. I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: tell them therefore, & say, At euen ye shal eate flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord your God)

13. And so at euen the quailes came and couered the campe: and in the morning the dewe lay round about the hoste.

14. And when the dewe that was fallen was ascended, beholde, a small round thing was vpon the face of the wildernes, small as the hoare frost on the earth.

15. And when the children of Israel saw [it], they said one to another, It [is] 

16. This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, 

17. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some lesse.

18. And when they did mete [it] with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no 

19. Moses then said vnto them, Let no man reserue thereof till morning.

20. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and 

21. And they gathered it euery morning, euery man according to his eating: for when the heate of the sunne came, it was melted.

22. And it came to pass, [that] on the sixth day they gathered 

23. And he answered them, This is that, which the Lord hath sayde, To morowe is the rest of the holy Sabbath vnto the Lorde: bake that to day which ye wil bake, and seethe that which ye wil seethe, and all that remaineth, lay it vp to be kept till the morning for you.

24. And they laied it vp till the morning, as Moses bade, and it stanke not, neyther was there any worme therein.

25. And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day [is] a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not 

26. Sixe dayes shall yee gather it, but in the seuenth day is the Sabbath: in it there shalbe none.

27. And it came to pass, [that] there 

28. And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses, Howe long refuse yee to keepe my commaundementes, and my lawes?

29. Beholde, howe the Lorde hath giuen you the Sabbath: therefore he giueth you the sixt day bread for two dayes: tary therefore euery man in his place: let no man goe out of his place the seuenth day.

30. So the people rested the seuenth day.

31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it [was] like 

32. And Moses said, This is that which the Lord hath commanded, Fill an Omer of it, to keepe it for your posteritie: that they may see the bread wherewith I haue fed you in wildernesse, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a

7. And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the

9. And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the 

10. So Ioshua did as Moses bad him, & fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went vp to the top of the hill.

11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let 

12. Nowe Moses handes were heauy: therefore they tooke a stone and put it vnder him, and hee sate vpon it: and Aaron and Hur stayed vp his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side: so his hands were steady vntill the going downe of the sunne.

13. And Ioshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this [for] a memorial 

15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it 

16. Also he said, The Lord hath sworne, that he will haue warre with Amalek from generation to generation.

## Exodus 18

1. When Iethro the Priest of Midian Moses father in lawe heard all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and howe the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt,

2. Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had 

3. And her two sonnes, (whereof the one was called Gershom: for he sayd, I haue bene an aliant in a strange land:

4. And the name of the other was Eliezer: for the God of my father, said he, was mine helpe, & deliuered me from the sword of Pharaoh)

5. And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the 

6. And he 

7. And Moses went out to meete his father in law, and did obeisance and kissed him, and eche asked other of his welfare: and they came into the tent.

8. Then Moses told his father in law all that the Lorde had done vnto Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israels sake, and all the trauaile that had come vnto them by the way, and howe the Lord deliuered them.

9. And Iethro reioyced at all the goodnesse, which the Lord had shewed to Israel, and because he had deliuered them out of the hande of the Egyptians.

10. And Jethro said, 

11. Now I know that the LORD [is] greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly 

12. And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law 

13. Now on the morow, when Moses sate to iudge the people, the people stoode about Moses from morning vnto euen.

14. And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people, he sayde, What is this that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thy selfe alone, and all the people stande about thee from morning vnto euen?

15. And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of 

16. When they haue a matter, they come vnto me, and I iudge betweene one and another, and declare the ordinances of God, and his lawes.

17. But Moses father in law said vnto him, The thing which thou doest, is not well.

18. Thou both weariest thy selfe greatly, & this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heauie for thee: thou art not able to doe it thy selfe alone.

19. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to 

20. And admonish them of the ordinances, & of the lawes, & shew them the way, wherein they must walke, and the worke that they must do.

21. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people 

22. And let them iudge the people at all seasons: but euery great matter let them bring vnto thee, and let them iudge all small causes: so shall it be easier for thee, when they shal beare the burden with thee.

23. If thou do this thing, (& God so command thee) both thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shal also go quietly to their place.

24. So Moses 

25. And Moses chose men of courage out of all Israel, and made them heads ouer the people, rulers ouer thousandes, rulers ouer hundreths, rulers ouer fifties, and rulers ouer tennes.

26. And they iudged the people at all seasons, but they brought the hard causes vnto Moses: for they iudged all small matters themselues.

27. And Moses 

## Exodus 19

1. In the 

2. For they departed from Rephidim, & came to the desart of Sinai, and camped in the wildernesse: euen there Israel camped before the mount.

3. And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of 

4. Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and [how] I bare you on 

5. Now therefore if ye wil heare my voyce in deede, and keepe my couenant, then ye shalbe my chiefe treasure aboue all people, though all the earth be mine.

6. Yee shall be vnto mee also a kingdome of Priestes, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel.

7. Moses then came & called for the Elders of the people, and proposed vnto them all these things, which the Lord commanded him.

8. And the people answered all together, and sayd, All that the Lord hath commaunded, we will doe; Moses reported the wordes of the people vnto the Lord.

9. And the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Lo, I come vnto thee in a thicke cloude, that the people may heare, whiles I talke with thee, and that they may also beleeue thee for euer. (for Moses had tolde the wordes of the people vnto the Lord)

10. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and 

11. And let them be ready on the third day: for the thirde day the Lorde will come downe in the sight of all the people vpon mount Sinai:

12. And thou shalt set markes vnto the people rounde about, saying, Take heede to your selues that ye goe not vp the mount, nor touche the border of it: whosoeuer toucheth the mount, shall surely die.

13. No hand shall touche it, but he shalbe stoned to death, or striken through with darts: whether it be beast or man, he shal not liue: when the horne bloweth long, they shal come vp into the mountaine.

14. Then Moses went downe from ye mount vnto the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.

15. And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at [your] 

16. And the thirde day, when it was morning, there was thunders and lightnings, and a thicke cloude vpon the mount, and the sounde of the trumpet exceeding loude, so that all the people, that was in the campe, was afrayde.

17. Then Moses brought the people out of the tents to meete with God, and they stoode in the nether part of the mount.

18. And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount 

19. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a 

20. (For the Lorde came downe vpon mount Sinai on the toppe of the mount) and when the Lord called Moses vp into the top of the mount, Moses went vp.

21. Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Go down, charge the people, that they breake not their boundes, to go vp to the Lord to gaze, least many of them perish.

22. And let the Priestes also which come to the Lorde be sanctified, least the Lorde destroy them.

23. And Moses sayde vnto the Lord, The people can not come vp into the mount Sinai: for thou hast charged vs, saying, Set markes on the mountaine, and sanctifie it.

24. And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the 

25. So Moses went downe vnto the people, & tolde them.

11. For in sixe dayes the Lord made the heauen and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seuenth day: therefore the Lorde blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

19. And sayde vnto Moses, Talke thou with vs, and we will heare: but let not God talke with vs, lest we die.

20. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to 

21. So the people stoode afarre off, but Moses drew neere vnto the darkenes where God was.

22. And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses, Thus thou shalt say vnto the children of Israel, Ye haue seene that I haue talked with you from heauen.

23. Ye shall not make therefore with me gods of siluer, nor gods of golde: you shall make you none.

24. An altar of earth thou shalt make vnto me, and thereon shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheepe, and thine oxen: in all places, where I shall put the remembrance of my Name, I will come vnto thee, and blesse thee.

25. But if thou wilt make mee an altar of stone, thou shalt not buylde it of hewen stones: for if thou lift vp thy toole vpon them, thou hast polluted them.

23. And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on 

24. And thou shalt put the two wrethen chaynes of golde in the two rings in the endes of the brest plate.

25. And the other two endes of the two wrethen cheines, thou shalt fasten in ye two embossements, and shalt put them vpon the shoulders of the Ephod on the foreside of it.

7. And thou shalt take the anoynting oyle, and shalt powre vpon his head, and anoynt him.

8. And thou shalt bring his sonnes, and put coates vpon them,

9. And shalt girde them with girdles, both Aaron and his sonnes: and shalt put the bonets on them, and the Priestes office shalbe theirs for a perpetuall lawe: thou shalt also fill the hands of Aaron, and the hands of his sonnes.

10. And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall 

11. So thou shalt kill the calfe before the Lord, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.

12. Then thou shalt take of the blood of the calfe, and put it vpon the hornes of the altar with thy finger, and shalt powre al the rest of the blood at the foote of the altar.

13. Also thou shalt take all the fat that couereth the inwardes, and the kall, that is on the liuer, and the two kidneis, and the fat that is vpon them, and shalt burne them vpon the altar.

14. But the flesh of the calfe, and his skin, and his doung shalt thou burne with fire without the hoste: it is a sinne offring.

15. Thou shalt also take one ramme, and Aron and his sonnes shall put their hands vpon the head of the ramme.

16. Then thou shalt kil the ramme, & take his blood, & sprinkle it round about vpon the altar,

17. And thou shalt cut the ramme in pieces, and wash the inwards of him and his legges, and shalt put them vpon the pieces thereof, and vpon his head.

18. And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it [is] a burnt offering unto the LORD: 

19. And thou shalt take the other ramme, & Aaron and his sonnes shall put their handes vpon the head of the ramme.

20. Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put [it] 

21. And thou shalt take of the blood that [is] 

22. Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that [is] upon them, and the right shoulder; for it [is] a 

23. And one loafe of bread, and one cake of bread tempered with oyle, and one wafer, out of the basket of the vnleauened bread that is before the Lorde.

24. And thou shalt put al this in the handes of Aaron, and in the handes of his sonnes, and shalt shake them to and fro before the Lorde.

25. Againe, thou shalt receyue them of their handes, & burne them vpon the altar besides the burnt offring for a sweete sauour before ye Lord: for this is an offering made by fire vnto the Lord.

26. And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it 

27. And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the 

28. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it [is] an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their

30. That sonne that shalbe Priest in his steade, shall put them on seuen dayes, when he commeth into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to minister in the holy place.

31. So thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seeth his flesh in the holy place.

32. And Aaron and his sonnes shall eate the flesh of the ram, & the bread that is in the basket, at the doore of ye Tabernacle of ye Congregation.

33. And they shall eat those things 

34. Now if ought of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread remaine vnto the morning, then thou shalt burne the rest with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is an holie thing.

35. Therefore shalt thou doe thus vnto Aaron & vnto his sonnes, according to all things, which I haue commanded thee: seuen dayes shalt thou consecrate them,

36. And thou shalt offer every day a bullock [for] a sin offering for 

37. Seuen dayes shalt thou cleanse the altar, & sanctifie it, so the altar shalbe most holy: and whatsoeuer toucheth the altar, shalbe holy.

38. Nowe this is that which thou shalt present vpon the altar: euen two lambes of one yere olde, day by day continually.

39. The one lambe thou shalt present in the morning, and the other lambe thou shalt present at euen.

40. And with the one lamb a 

41. And the other lambe thou shalt present at euen: thou shalt doe thereto according to the offring of the morning, and according to the drinke offring thereof, to be a burnt offring for a sweete sauour vnto, the Lorde.

42. This shalbe a continuall burnt offring in your generations at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord, where I wil make appoyntment with you, to speake there vnto thee.

43. And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and [the tabernacle] shall be sanctified by my 

44. And I will sanctifie the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the altar: I will sanctifie also Aaron & his sonnes to be my Priests,

45. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will bee their God.

46. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: 

## Exodus 30

1. And thou shalt make an altar 

2. A cubit [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits [shall be] the height thereof: the horns thereof [shall be] 

3. And thou shalt ouerlay it with fine golde, both the toppe therof and the sides thereof round about, and his hornes: also thou shalt make vnto it a crowne of gold round about.

4. Besides this thou shalt make vnder this crowne two golden rings on either side: euen on euery side shalt thou make them, that they may be as places for the barres to beare it withall.

5. The which barres thou shalt make of Shittim wood, and shalt couer them with golde.

6. And thou shalt put it 

7. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he 

8. Likewise at eue, when Aaron setteth vp the lampes thereof, he shall burne incense: this perfume shalbe perpetually before ye Lord, throughout your generations.

9. Ye shall offer no 

10. And Aaron shall make reconciliation vpon the hornes of it once in a yere with the blood of the sinne offring in the day of reconciliation: once in the yeere shall hee make reconciliation vpon it throughout your generations: this is most holy vnto the Lord.

11. Afterward the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

12. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man 

13. This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the 

14. All that are nombred from twentie yeere olde and aboue, shall giue an offring to the Lord.

15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when [they] give an offering unto the LORD, 

16. So thou shalt take the money of the redemption of the children of Israel, and shalt put it vnto the vse of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that it may be a memoriall vnto the children of Israel before the Lorde for the redemption of your liues.

17. Also the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

18. Thou shalt also make a lauer of brasse, and his foote of brasse to wash, and shalt put it betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and shalt put water therein.

19. For Aaron and his sons shall 

20. When they go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, or when they goe vnto the Altar to minister and to make the perfume of ye burnt offring to the Lorde, they shall wash themselues with water, lest they die.

21. So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute 

22. Also the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

23. Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred 

24. Also of cassia fiue hundreth, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, & of oyle oliue an Hin.

25. So thou shalt make of it the oyle of holie oyntment, euen a most precious oyntment after the arte of the Apothecarie: this shalbe the oyle of holy oyntment.

26. And thou shalt anoint the 

27. Also the Table, & al the instruments thereof, and the Candlesticke, with all the instruments thereof, and the altar of incense:

28. Also the Altar of burnt offring with al his instruments, and the lauer and his foote.

29. So thou shalt sanctifie them, & they shalbe most holy: all that shal touch them, shalbe holy.

30. Thou shalt also anoint Aaron & his sonnes, & shalt consecrate them, that they may minister vnto me in the Priests office.

31. Moreouer thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel, saying, This shalbe an holy oynting oyle vnto me, throughout your generations.

32. Upon 

33. Whosoever compoundeth [any] like it, or whosoever putteth [any] of it upon 

34. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and 

35. Then thou shalt make of them perfume composed after the arte of the apothecarie, mingled together, pure and holy.

36. And thou shalt beate it to pouder, & shalt put of it before the Arke of the Testimonie in the Tabernacle of ye Cogregatio, where I wil make appointmet with thee: it shalbe vnto you most holy.

37. And ye shal not make vnto you any compositio like this perfume, which thou shalt make: it shalbe vnto thee holy for the Lord.

38. Whosoeuer shal make like vnto that to smell thereto, euen he shalbe cut off from his people.

## Exodus 31

1. And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

2. See, I 

3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of 

4. To finde out curious workes to worke in golde, and in siluer, and in brasse,

5. Also in the arte to set stones, & to carue in timber, & to worke in all maner of workmaship.

6. And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are 

7. That is, the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the Arke of the Testimonie, & the Merciseate that shalbe therupon, with all instruments of the Tabernacle:

8. And the table and his furniture, and the 

9. Likewise the Altar of burnt offring with al his instruments, and the Lauer with his foote:

10. Also the garments of the ministration, & ye holy garments for Aaron ye Priest, & the garmets of his sonnes, to minister in the Priestes office,

11. And the 

12. Afterwarde the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,

13. Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, 

14. Ye shall keep the 

15. Sixe dayes shall men worke, but in the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the holy rest to the Lord: whosoeuer doeth any worke in the Sabbath day, shall dye the death.

16. Wherfore the children of Israel shal keepe the Sabbath, that they may obserue the rest throughout their generations for an euerlasting couenant.

17. It [is] a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he 

18. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables 

## Exodus 32

1. And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, 

2. And Aaron said unto them, 

3. And all the people brake off the 

4. And he received [them] at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a 

5. When Aaron sawe that, he made an Altar before it: and Aaron proclaimed, saying, To morow shalbe the holy day of the Lord.

6. So they rose vp the next day in the morning, and offred burnt offerings, & brought peace offrings: also the people sate them downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play.

7. Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Go, get thee downe: for thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath corrupted their wayes.

8. They 

9. Againe the Lord said vnto Moses, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stiffe necked people.

10. Now 

11. But Moses praied vnto the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, why doeth thy wrath waxe hote against thy people, which thou hast brought out of the lande of Egypt, with great power and with a mightie hand?

12. Wherefore shall the Egyptians speake, and say, He hath brought them out maliciously for to slay them in the mountaines, and to consume them from the earth? turne from thy fearce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill towarde thy people.

13. Remember 

14. Then the Lord changed his minde fro the euil, which he threatned to do vnto his people.

15. So Moses returned and went downe from the mountaine with the two Tables of the Testimonie in his hande: the Tables were written on both their sides, euen on the one side and on the other were they written.

16. And the tables [were] the work of God, and 

17. And when Ioshua heard the noyse of the people, as they shouted, he said vnto Moses, There is a noyse of warre in the hoste.

18. Who answered, It is not the noyse of them that haue the victorie, nor the noyse of them that are ouercome: but I do heare ye noyse of singing.

19. Nowe, as soone as he came neere vnto the hoste, he sawe the calfe and the dancing: so Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his handes, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine.

20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and strawed [it] upon the water, and made the children of Israel 

21. Also Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?

22. Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord waxe fearce: Thou knowest this people, that they are euen set on mischiefe.

23. And they sayde vnto me, Make vs gods to go before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.)

24. Then I sayde to them, Ye that haue golde, plucke it off: and they brought it me, & I did cast it into the fire, and thereof came this calfe.

25. And when Moses saw that the people [were] 

26. And Moses stoode in ye gate of the campe, and sayde, Who pertaineth to the Lorde? let him come to mee; all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues vnto him.

27. And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and 

28. So the children of Leui did as Moses had commanded: and there fel of the people the same day about three thousand men.

29. For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his 

30. And when the morning came, Moses sayde vnto the people, Yee haue committed a grieuous crime: but now I wil goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your sinne.

31. Moses therefore went againe vnto ye Lord, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of golde.

32. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, 

33. And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my 

34. 
          

35. So the Lorde plagued the people, because they caused Aaro to make ye calfe which he made.

## Exodus 33

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, [and] 

2. And I will send an Angel before thee & will cast out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, the Hiuites, and the Iebusites:

3. To a lande, I say, that floweth with milke and hony: for I will not goe vp with thee, because thou art a stiffe necked people, least I consume thee in the way.

4. And when the people heard this euill tydings, they sorowed, and no man put on his best rayment.

5. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye [are] a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know 

6. So the children of Israel layed their good raiment from them, after Moses came downe from the mount Horeb.

7. And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the 

8. And when Moses went out vnto the Tabernacle, all the people rose vp, and stood euery man at his tent doore, and looked after Moses, vntil he was gone into the Tabernacle.

9. And assoone as Moses was entred into the Tabernacle, the cloudie pillar descended & stood at the doore of the Tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

10. Nowe when all the people saw the cloudie pillar stand at the Tabernacle doore, all the people rose vp, and worshipped euery man in his tent doore.

11. And the LORD spake unto Moses 

12. And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by 

13. Nowe therefore, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, shewe mee nowe thy way, that I may knowe thee, and that I may finde grace in thy sight: consider also that this nation is thy people.

14. And he said, My 

15. Then he sayd vnto him, If thy presence go not with vs, cary vs not hence.

16. And wherein nowe shal it be knowen, that I and thy people haue found fauour in thy sight? Shall it not be when thou goest with vs? so I, and thy people shall haue preeminence before all the people that are vpon the earth.

17. And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, I will doe this also that thou hast saide: for thou hast founde grace in my sight, and I knowe thee by name.

18. And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy

21. And the LORD said, Behold, [there is] a place by

## Exodus 34

1. And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Hewe thee two Tables of stone, like vnto the first, and I will write vpon the Tables the wordes that were in the first Tables, which thou brakest in pieces.

2. And be ready in ye morning, that thou mayest come vp earely vnto the mount of Sinai, and waite there for me in the top of the mount.

3. But let no man come vp with thee, neither let any man be seene throughout all the mount, neyther let the sheepe nor cattell feede before this mount.

4. Then Moses hewed two Tables of stone like vnto the first, and rose vp earely in the morning, and went vp vnto the mount of Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, & tooke in his hande two Tables of stone.

5. And the Lorde descended in the cloude, and stoode with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord.

8. Then Moses made haste & bowed him selfe to the earth, and worshipped,

9. And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; 

10. And he answered, Behold, I will make a couenant before all thy people, and will do marueiles, such as haue not bene done in all the worlde, neyther in all nations: and all the people among whom thou art, shal see the worke of the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

11. Keepe diligently that which I commande thee this day: Beholde, I will cast out before thee the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites.

12. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a

15. Lest thou make a compact with the inhabitantes of the lande, and when they goe a whoring after their gods, and doe sacrifice vnto their gods, some man call thee, & thou eate of his sacrifice:

16. And least thou take of their daughters vnto thy sonnes, and their daughters goe a whoring after their gods, and make thy sonnes goe a whoring after their gods.

17. Thou shalt make thee no

19. Euery male, that first openeth the wombe, shalbe mine: also all the first borne of thy flocke shalbe rekoned mine, both of beeues and sheepe.

20. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem [him] not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me

27. And the Lord said vnto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenour of these words I haue made a couenant with thee & with Israel.

28. And he was there with the LORD 

29. So when Moses came downe fro mount Sinai, the two Tables of the Testimonie were in Moses hande, as hee descended from the mount: (nowe Moses wist not that the skinne of his face shone bright, after that God had talked with him.

30. And Aaron and all the children of Israel looked vpon Moses, and beholde, the skin of his face shone bright, and they were afraid to come neere him)

31. But Moses called them: and Aaron and all the chiefe of the congregatio returned vnto him: and Moses talked with them.

32. And afterwarde all the children of Israel came neere, and he charged them with al that the Lord had said vnto him in mount Sinai.

33. So Moses made an end of comuning with them, and had put a couering vpon his face.

34. But when Moses went in 

35. And the children of Israel sawe the face of Moses, howe the skin of Moses face shone bright: therefore Moses put the couering vpon his face, vntill he went to speake with God.

## Exodus 35

1. Then Moses assembled all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and sayd vnto them, These are the wordes which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them:

2. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy 

3. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout all your habitations vpon the Sabbath day.

4. Againe, Moses spake vnto all the Congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, saying,

5. Take from among you an offering vnto the Lorde: whosoeuer is of a willing heart, let him bring this offring to the Lord, namely golde, and siluer, and brasse:

20. Then all the Congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

21. And euery one, whose heart encouraged him, & euery one, whose spirit made him willing, came and brought an offring to the Lord, for the worke of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, & for all his vses, and for the holy garments.

22. Both men & women, as many as were free hearted, came and brought taches and earings, and rings, and bracelets, all were iewels of golde: and euery one that offered an offring of gold vnto the Lord:

23. Euery man also, which had blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet, & fine linen, and goates heare, and rammes skinnes died red, and badgers skins, brought them.

24. All that offered an oblation of siluer and of brasse, brought the offring vnto the Lord: and euery one, that had Shittim wood for any maner worke of the ministration, brought it.

25. And all the women that were 

26. And all the women 

27. And ye rulers brought onix stones, & stones to be set in the Ephod, and in the brest plate:

28. Also spice, and oyle for light, and for the anoynting oyle, and for the sweete perfume.

29. The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made 

30. Then Moses sayde vnto the children of Israel, Beholde, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the sonne of Vri, the sonne of Hur of the tribe of Iudah,

31. And hath filled him with an excellent spirit of wisdome, of vnderstanding, and of knowledge, and in all maner worke,

32. To finde out curious workes, to worke in golde, and in siluer, and in brasse,

33. And in grauing stones to set them, and in karuing of wood, euen to make any maner of fine worke.

34. And he hath put in his heart that hee may teach other: both hee, and Aholiab the sonne of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan:

35. Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner 

## Exodus 36

1. Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the 

2. For Moses had called Bezaleel, and Aholiab, and all the wise hearted men, in whose heartes the Lorde had giuen wisedome, euen as many as their hearts encouraged to come vnto that worke to worke it.

3. And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it [withal]. And 

4. So all the wise men, that wrought all the holy worke, came euery man from his worke which they wrought,

5. And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring 

6. Then Moses gaue a commandement, and they caused it to be proclaymed throughout the hoste, saying, Let neither man nor woman prepare any more worke for the oblation of the Sanctuarie. So the people were stayed from offring.

7. For the stuffe they had, was sufficient for all the worke to make it, and too much.

8. And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains [of] fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: [with] 

9. The length of one curtaine was twentie & eight cubits, & the breadth of one curtaine foure cubites: and the curtaines were all of one cise.

10. And he coupled fiue curtaines together, & other fiue coupled he together.

11. And he made strings of blewe silke by the edge of one curtaine, in the seluedge of the coupling: likewise he made on the side of the other curtaine in the seluedge in the second coupling.

12. Fiftie strings made he in the one curtaine, and fiftie strings made he in the edge of the other curtaine, which was in the second coupling: the strings were set one against another.

13. After, he made fiftie taches of golde, and coupled the curtaines one to another with the taches: so was it one Tabernacle.

14. Also he made curtaines of goates heare for the couering vpon the Tabernacle: he made them to the nomber of eleuen curtaines.

15. The length of one curtaine had thirtie cubites, & the bredth of one curtaine foure cubites: the eleuen curtaines were of one cise.

16. And hee coupled fiue curtaines by themselues, and sixe curtaines by themselues:

17. Also he made fiftie strings vpon the edge of one curtaine in the seluedge in the coupling, & fiftie strings made hee vpon the edge of the other curtaine in the second coupling.

18. He made also fiftie taches of brasse to couple the couering that it might be one.

19. And he made a 

20. And he made boards for the tabernacle [of] shittim wood, 

21. The length of a board was ten cubites, and the bredth of one board was a cubite, & an halfe.

22. One board had two tenons, set in order as the feete of a ladder, one against another: thus made he for all the boardes of the Tabernacle.

23. So he made twentie boardes for the South side of the Tabernacle, euen full South.

24. And fourtie sockets of siluer made he vnder the twentie boardes, two sockets vnder one board for his two tenons, and two sockets vnder another board for his two tenons.

25. Also for the other side of the Tabernacle toward the North, he made twentie boards,

26. And their fourtie sockets of siluer, two sockets vnder one board, and two sockets vnder another boarde.

27. And for the sides of the tabernacle 

28. And two boardes made he in the corners of the Tabernacle, for either side,

29. And they were ioyned beneath, and likewise were made sure aboue with a ring: thus he did to both in both corners.

30. So there were eight boards & their sixteene sockets of siluer, vnder euery board two sockets.

31. After, he made barres of Shittim wood, fiue for the boards in ye one side of ye Tabernacle,

32. And fiue barres for the boardes in the other side of the Tabernacle, and fiue barres for the boards of the Tabernacle on the side toward the West.

33. And he made the middest barre to shoote through the boards, from the one end to ye other.

34. He ouerlayd also the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the barres, and couered the barres with golde.

35. And he made a 

36. And made thereunto foure pillars of Shittim, & ouerlayd them with golde: whose hookes were also of golde, and hee cast for them foure sockets of siluer.

37. And he made an

## Exodus 37

1. After this, Bezaleel made the Arke of Shittim wood, two cubites and an halfe long and a cubite and an halfe broade, and a cubite and an halfe hie:

7. And he made two Cherubims of gold, vpo the two endes of the Merciseate: euen of worke beaten with the hammer made he them.

8. One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the [other] end on that side: out 

9. And the Cherubims spread out their wings on hie, & couered the Merciseat with their wings, & their faces were one towards another: towarde the Merciseat were the faces of the Cherubims.

10. Also he made ye Table of Shittim wood: two cubites was the length thereof, and a cubite the breadth thereof, and a cubite and an halfe the height of it.

11. And hee ouerlayde it with fine golde, and made thereto a crowne of golde round about.

12. Also he made thereto a border of an hand breadth round about, and made vpon the border a crowne of golde round about.

13. And he cast for it foure rings of gold, and put the rings in the foure corners that were in the foure feete thereof.

14. Against the border were the rings, as places for the barres to beare the Table.

15. And he made the barres of Shittim wood, & couered them with golde to beare the Table.

16. Also he made the instruments for the Table of pure golde: dishes for it, and incense cuppes for it, and goblets for it, & couerings for it, wherewith it should be couered.

17. Likewise he made the Candlesticke of pure golde: of worke beaten out with the hammer made he the Candlesticke: and his shaft, and his branche, his bolles, his knops, and his floures were of one piece.

18. And sixe branches came out of the sides thereof: three branches of the Candlesticke out of the one side of it, and three branches of the Candlesticke out of the other side of it.

19. In one branche three bolles made like almondes, a knop & a floure: and in another branch three bolles made like almondes, a knop and a floure: and so throughout the sixe branches that proceeded out of the Candlesticke.

20. And vpon the Candlesticke were foure bolles after the facion of almondes, the knoppes thereof and the floures thereof:

21. That is, vnder euery two branches a knop made thereof, & a knop vnder the second branch thereof, and a knop vnder the thirde branche thereof, according to the sixe branches comming out of it.

22. Their knops & their branches were of the same: it was all one beaten worke of pure gold.

23. And he made for it seuen lampes with the snuffers, and snufdishes thereof of pure golde.

24. [Of] a 

25. Furthermore he made the perfume altar of Shittim wood: the length of it was a cubite, & the breadth of it a cubite (it was square) and two cubites hie, & the hornes thereof were of ye same.

26. And he couered it with pure gold, both the top and the sides thereof rounde about, and the hornes of it, and made vnto it a crowne of golde round about.

27. And he made two rings of gold for it, vnder the crowne thereof in the two corners of the two sides thereof, to put barres in for to beare it therewith.

28. Also he made the barres of Shittim wood, and ouerlayde them with golde.

29. And he made the holy anointing oyle, & the sweete pure incense after ye apothecaries arte.

10. Their pillars were twentie, and their brasen sockets twentie: the hookes of the pillars, and their filets were of siluer.

11. And on the Northside the hanginges were an hundreth cubites: their pillars twentie, & their sockets of brasse twentie, the hookes of the pillars and their filets of siluer.

20. But all the pins of the Tabernacle and of the court round about were of brasse.

21. This is the sum of the tabernacle, [even] of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, [for] the service of the 

22. So Bezaleel the sonne of Vri the sonne of Hur of the tribe of Iudah, made all that the Lord commanded Moses.

4. For the which they made shoulders to couple together: for it was closed by the two edges thereof.

5. And the broydred garde of his Ephod that was vpon him, was of the same stuffe, and of like worke: euen of golde, of blewe silke, and purple, & skarlet, and fine twined linen, as the Lorde had commanded Moses.

6. And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as 

7. And put them on the shoulders of the Ephod, as stones for a remembrance of the children of Israel, as the Lorde had commaunded Moses.

8. Also he made the brestplate of broydred worke like the worke of the Ephod: to wit, of gold, blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet, and fine twined linen.

9. They made the brest plate double, & it was square, an hand breadth long, & an hand breadth broad: it was also double.

20. They made also two other golden rings, & put them on the two sides of the Ephod, beneath on the foreside of it, & ouer against his coupling aboue the broydered garde of the Ephod.

21. Then they fastened the brest plate by his rings vnto the rings of the Ephod, with a lace of blewe silke, that it might bee fast vpon the broydered garde of the Ephod, and that the brest plate should not be loosed fro the Ephod, as the Lorde had commanded Moses.
