3. Judah is gone into captivity because 

4. The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come 

5. Her adversaries 

6. And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty hath departed: her princes are become 

7. Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people 

8. Ierusalem hath grieuously sinned, therefore shee is in derision: all that honoured her, despise her, because they haue seene her filthinesse: yea, she sigheth and turneth backeward.

9. 
          

10. The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen [that] the nations entered into her sanctuary, whom 

11. All her people sigh and seeke their bread: they haue giuen their pleasant thinges for meate to refresh the soule: see, O Lorde, and consider: for I am become vile.

12. [Is it] nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there is any 

13. From above hath

15. The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty [men] in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, [as] in a 

16. For these things I weepe: mine eye, euen mine eye casteth out water, because the comforter that should refresh my soule, is farre from me: my children are desolate, because the enemie preuailed.

17. Zion spreadeth forth her hands, [and there is] none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] around him: Jerusalem is 

18. The Lorde is righteous: for I haue rebelled against his commandement: heare, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorowe: my virgins and my yong men are gone into captiuitie.

19. I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: my priests and my elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they 

20. Behold, O Lorde, howe I am troubled: my bowels swell: mine heart is turned within me, for I am ful of heauinesse: the sword spoyleth abroad, as death doeth at home.

21. They haue heard that I mourne, but there is none to comfort mee: all mine enemies haue heard of my trouble, and are glad, that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day, that thou hast pronounced, and they shalbe like vnto me.

## Lamentations 2

1. How hath the Lord 

2. The Lord hath destroyed al the habitations of Iaakob, & not spared: he hath throwen downe in his wrath ye strong holds of the daughter of Iudah: he hath cast the downe to ye ground: he hath polluted the kingdome and the princes thereof.

3. He hath cut off in [his] fierce anger all the 

4. He 

5. The Lord was as an enemie: he hath deuoured Israel, and consumed all his palaces: hee hath destroyed his strong holdes, and hath increased in the daughter of Iudah lamentation and mourning.

6. For hee hath destroyed his Tabernacle, as a garden, hee hath destroyed his Congregation: the Lorde hath caused the feastes and Sabbathes to bee forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his wrath the King and the Priest.

7. The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a 

8. The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart 

9. Her gates are sunke to the grounde: he hath destroyed and broken her barres: her King and her princes are among the Gentiles: the Lawe is no more, neither can her Prophets receiue any vision from the Lord.

10. The Elders of the daughter of Zion sit vpon the grounde, and keepe silence: they haue cast vp dust vpon their heades: they haue girded them selues with sackecloth: the virgines of Ierusalem hang downe their heades to the ground.

11. Mine eyes doe saile with teares: my bowels swell: my liuer is powred vpon the earth, for the destructio of the daughter of my people, because the children and sucklings swoone in the streetes of the citie.

12. They haue sayd to their mothers, Where is bread and drinke? when they swooned as the wounded in the streetes of the citie, and whe they gaue vp the ghost in their mothers bosome.

13. 
          

14. Thy prophets have 

15. All that passe by the way, clap their hands at thee: they hisse and wagge their head vpon the daughter Ierusalem, saying, Is this the citie that men call, The perfection of beautie, and the ioye of the whole earth?

16. All thine enemies haue opened their mouth against thee: they hisse and gnashe the teeth, saying, Let vs deuoure it: certainely this is the day that we looked for: we haue founde and seene it.

17. The Lorde hath done that which he had purposed: he hath fulfilled his worde that he had determined of old time: he hath throwen downe, and not spared: hee hath caused thine enemie to reioyce ouer thee, and set vp the horne of thine aduersaries.

18. Their heart cryed vnto the Lord, O wall of the daughter Zion, let teares runne downe like a riuer, day and night: take thee no rest, neither let the apple of thine eye cease.

19. Arise, cry in the night: in the beginning of the watches powre out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift vp thine handes towarde him for the life of thy yong children, that faint for hunger in the corners of all the streetes.

20. Beholde, O Lord, and consider to whome thou hast done thus: shall the women eate their fruite, and children of a spanne long? shall the Priest and the Prophet be slaine in the Sanctuarie of the Lord?

21. The yong and the olde lie on the ground in the streetes: my virgins and my yong men are fallen by the sworde: thou hast slaine them in the day of thy wrath: thou hast killed and not spared.

22. Thou hast called as in a solemne daye my terrours rounde about, so that in the day of the Lordes wrath none escaped nor remained: those that I haue nourished and brought vp, hath mine enemie consumed.

## Lamentations 3

1. I [am] the man [that] hath seen 

2. He hath ledde mee, and brought me into darkenes, but not to light.

3. Surely he is turned against me: he turneth his hand against me all the day.

4. My flesh and my skinne hath he caused to waxe olde, and he hath broken my bones.

5. He hath 

6. He hath set me in darke places, as they that be dead for euer.

7. He hath hedged about mee, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chaines heauy.

8. Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my 

9. He hath 

10. 
          

11. He hath stopped my wayes, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.

12. He hath bent his bow & made me a marke for the arrow.

13. Hee caused the arrowes of his quiuer to enter into my reines.

14. I was a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.

15. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunk with 

16. He hath also broken my teeth with stones, and hath couered me with ashes.

17. Thus my soule was farre off from peace: I forgate prosperitie,

18. And I said, My strength and my 

19. Remembring mine affliction, & my mourning, the wormewood and the gall.

20. My soul hath [them] still in remembrance, and is humbled 

21. I consider this in mine heart: therefore haue I hope.

22. [It is of] the LORD'S 

23. [They are] new 

24. The LORD [is] my 

25. The Lord is good vnto them, that trust in him, and to the soule that seeketh him.

26. It is good both to trust, and to waite for the saluation of the Lord.

27. [It is] good for a man that he should bear the yoke in his 

28. He sitteth alone 

29. He putteth his 

30. Hee giueth his cheeke to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproches.

31. For the Lord will not forsake for euer.

32. But though he sende affliction, yet will he haue compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.

33. For he doth not 

34. In stamping vnder his feete all the prisoners of the earth,

35. In ouerthrowing the right of a man before the face of the most high,

36. To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord 

37. Who [is] he [that] saith, and it cometh to pass, [when] the Lord 

38. Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not 

39. Why doth a living 

40. Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe to the Lord.

41. Let us lift up 

42. We haue sinned, and haue rebelled, therefore thou hast not spared.

43. Thou hast couered vs with wrath, and persecuted vs: thou hast slaine and not spared.

44. Thou hast couered thy selfe with a cloude, that our prayer should not passe through.

45. Thou hast made vs as the ofscouring and refuse in the middes of the people.

46. All our enemies haue opened their mouth against vs.

47. Feare, and a snare is come vpon vs with desolation and destruction.

48. Mine eye casteth out riuers of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

49. Mine eye droppeth without stay and ceaseth not,

50. Till the Lorde looke downe, and beholde from heauen.

51. My eye 

52. Mine enemies chased me sore like a birde, without cause.

53. They have cut off my life 

54. Waters flowed ouer mine head, then thought I, I am destroyed.

55. I called vpon thy Name, O Lorde, out of the lowe dungeon.

56. Thou hast heard my voyce: stoppe not thine eare from my sigh and from my cry.

57. Thou drewest neere in the day that I called vpon thee: thou saydest, Feare not.

58. O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my 

59. O Lorde, thou hast seene my wrong, iudge thou my cause.

60. Thou hast seene all their vengeance, and all their deuises against me.

61. Thou hast heard their reproch, O Lord, and all their imaginations against me:

62. The lippes also of those that rose against me, and their whispering against me continually.

63. Behold, their sitting downe and their rising vp, how I am their song.

64. Giue them a recompence, O Lord, according to the worke of their handes.

65. Giue them sorow of heart, euen thy curse to them.

66. Persecute with wrath & destroy them from vnder the heauen, O Lord.

1. How is the 

2. The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen 

3. Even the sea monsters 

4. The tongue of the sucking childe cleaueth to the roofe of his mouth for thirst: the yong children aske bread, but no man breaketh it vnto them.

5. They that did feede delicately, perish in the streetes: they that were brought vp in skarlet, embrace the dongue.

6. For the iniquitie of the daughter of my people is become greater then the sinne of Sodom, that was destroyed as in a moment, & none pitched campes against her.

7. Her Nazarites were purer then the snowe, & whiter then ye milke: they were more ruddie in bodie, then the redde precious stones; they were like polished saphir.

8. Their

11. The Lord hath accomplished his indignation: he hath powred out his fierce wrath, he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath deuoured the foundations thereof.

12. The Kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not haue beleeued that the aduersarie and the enemie should haue entred into the gates of Ierusalem:

13. For the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of 

14. They have wandered [as] blind [men] 

15. But they cried vnto them, Depart, ye polluted, depart, depart, touch not: therefore they fled away, and wandered: they haue sayd among the heathen, They shal no more dwell there.

16. The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no longer regard them: 

17. As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for 

18. They hunt our steppes that we cannot goe in our streetes: our ende is neere, our dayes are fulfilled, for our ende is come.

19. Our persecuters are swifter then the egles of the heauen: they pursued vs vpon the mountaines, and layed waite for vs in the wildernes.

20. The

9. We procured our bread with [the peril of] our lives because of the sword 

10. Our skinne was blacke like as an ouen because of the terrible famine.

11. They defiled the women in Zion, and the maydes in the cities of Iudah.
