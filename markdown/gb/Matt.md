1. Now when 

2. Saying, Where is that King of the Iewes that is borne? For wee haue seene his starre in the East, and are come to worship him.

3. When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was 

4. And when he had gathered all the 

5. And they saide vnto him, At Beth-leem in Iudea: for so it is written by the Prophet,

6. And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Juda, art not the 

7. Then Herod priuily called the Wisemen, and diligently inquired of them the time of the starre that appeared,

8. And sent them to Beth-leem, saying, Goe, and searche diligently for the babe: and when ye haue founde him, bring mee worde againe, that I may come also, and worship him.

9. So when they had heard the King, they departed: and loe, the starre which they had seene in the East, went before them, till it came and stoode ouer the place where the babe was.

10. And when they sawe the starre, they reioyced with an exceeding great ioy,

11. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and 

12. And being 

13. 
          

14. So he arose and tooke the babe and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,

15. And was there vnto the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne.

16. Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked of the Wisemen, was exceeding wroth, and sent foorth, and slew all the male children that were in Beth-leem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two yeere old and vnder, according to the time which he had diligently searched out of the Wisemen.

17. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken 

18. In Rama was there 

19. 
          

20. Saying, Arise, and take the babe and his mother, and goe into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the babes life.

21. Then he arose vp and tooke the babe and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

22. But whe he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in stead of his father Herod, he was afraide to go thither: yet after he was warned of God in a dreame, he turned aside into the parts of Galile,

23. And went and dwelt in a citie called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, which was, That hee should be called a Nazarite.

## Matthew 3

1. In 

2. And saying, 

3. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, 

4. And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was 

5. Then went out to him 

6. And were baptized of him in Jordan, 

7. 
          

8. 
          

9. 
          

10. And now also is the axe put to the roote of the trees: therfore euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe, & cast into ye fire.

11. 
          

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. But Iohn earnestly put him backe, saying, I haue neede to be baptized of thee, and commest thou to me?

15. And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil 

16. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto 

17. 
          

## Matthew 4

1. Then was 

2. And when he had fasted 

3. Then came to him the tempter, and said, If thou be the Sonne of God, commande that these stones be made bread.

4. But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not liue by bread onely, but by euery worde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

5. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a 

6. And said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: for it is written, that he wil giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with their hands they shall lift thee vp, lest at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone.

7. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not 

8. Againe the deuil tooke him vp into an exceeding hie mountaine, and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them,

9. And sayd to him, All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe, and worship me.

10. Then sayd Iesus vnto him, Auoyde Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.

11. Then the deuill left him: and beholde, the Angels came, and ministred vnto him.

12. 
          

13. And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in 

14. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Propet, saying,

15. The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, [by] the way of the 

16. The people which sate in darkenes, sawe great light: and to them which sate in the region, and shadowe of death, light is risen vp.

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at 

18. 
          

19. And he sayd vnto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

20. And they straightway leauing the nets, folowed him.

21. And when he was gone forth from thence, he saw other two brethren, Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn his brother in a ship with Zebedeus their father, mending their nets, & he called them.

22. And they without tarying, leauing the ship, and their father, folowed him.

23. And 

24. And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and 

25. And there folowed him great multitudes out of Galile, and Decapolis, and Hierusalem, and Iudea, and from beyond Iordan.

## Matthew 5

1. And when he sawe the multitude, he went vp into a mountaine: and when he was set, his disciples came to him.

2. 
          

3. Blessed [are] the 

4. Blessed are they that mourne: for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meeke: for they shall inherite the earth.

6. Blessed are they which hunger and thirst for righteousnes: for they shalbe filled.

7. Blessed are the mercifull: for they shal obteine mercie.

8. Blessed [are] the 

9. Blessed are the peace makers: for they shal be called the children of God.

10. Blessed are they which suffer persecution for righteousnes sake: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.

11. Blessed shall ye be when men reuile you, and persecute you, & say all maner of euill against you for my sake, falsely.

12. Reioyce and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen: for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.

13. Ye 

14. Ye are the 

15. Neither doe men light a candel, and put it vnder a bushel, but on a candlesticke, and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house.

16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.

17. 
          

18. For truly I say vnto you, Till heauen, and earth perish, one iote or one title of the Law shall not scape, till all things be fulfilled.

19. 
          

20. For I say vnto you, except your righteousnes exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen.

21. 
          

22. But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be 

23. 
          

24. Leaue there thine offring before the altar, and goe thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

25. 
          

26. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast 

27. 
          

28. But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart.

29. And if thy 

30. Also if thy right hand make thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for better it is for thee that one of thy members perish, then that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

31. It hath bene sayd also, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a bill of diuorcement.

32. But I say vnto you, whosoeuer shall put away his wife (except it be for fornication) causeth her to commit adulterie: & whosoeuer shal marrie her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie.

33. 
          

34. But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God:

35. Nor yet by the earth: for it is his footestoole: neither by Hierusalem: for it is the citie of the great King.

36. Neither shalt thou sweare by thine head, because thou canst not make one heare white or blacke.

37. But let your communication be, 

38. 
          

39. But I say vnto you, Resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also.

40. And if any man wil sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him haue thy cloke also.

41. And whosoeuer will compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.

42. Giue to him that asketh, and from him that would borowe of thee, turne not away.

43. Ye haue heard that it hath bin said, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate your enemie.

44. But I say vnto you, Loue your enemies: blesse them that curse you: doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you, and persecute you,

45. 
          

46. For if ye loue them, which loue you, what rewarde shall you haue? Doe not the Publicanes euen the same?

47. And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do not even the 

48. Ye shall therefore be perfit, as your Father which is in heauen, is perfite.

## Matthew 6

1. Take heed that ye do not your 

2. Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the 

3. But when thou doest thine almes, let not thy left hand knowe what thy right hand doeth,

4. That thine almes may be in secret, and thy Father that seeth in secret, hee will rewarde thee openly.

5. 
          

6. But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber and when thou hast shut thy doore, pray vnto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall rewarde thee openly.

7. But when ye pray, use not 

8. Be ye not like them therefore: for your Father knoweth whereof ye haue neede, before ye aske of him.

9. 
          

10. Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done euen in earth, as it is in heauen.

11. Give us this day our 

12. And forgiue vs our dettes, as we also forgiue our detters.

13. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from 

14. 
          

15. But if ye do not forgiue men their trespasses,, no more will your father forgiue you your trespaces.

16. 
          

17. But when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face,

18. That thou seeme not vnto men to fast, but vnto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret, will rewarde thee openly.

19. 
          

20. But lay vp treasures for your selues in heauen, where neither the mothe nor canker corrupteth, & where theeues neither digge through, nor steale.

21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22. 
          

23. But if thine eye be wicked, then all thy body shalbe darke. Wherefore if the light that is in thee, be darkenes, howe great is that darkenesse?

24. 
          

25. 
          

26. Behold the fowls of the 

27. Which of you by 

28. And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they 

29. Yet I say vnto you, that euen Solomon in all his glorie was not arayed like one of these.

30. Wherefore if God so clothe the grasse of the fielde which is to day, and to morowe is cast into the ouen, shall he not doe much more vnto you, O ye of litle faith?

31. Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eate? or what shall we drinke? or where with shall we be clothed?

32. (For after all these things seeke the Gentiles) for your heauenly Father knoweth, that ye haue neede of all these things.

33. But seeke ye first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shall be ministred vnto you.

34. Care not then for the morowe: for the morowe shall care for it selfe: the day hath ynough with his owne griefe.

## Matthew 7

1. Judge 

2. Eor with what iudgement ye iudge, ye shall be iudged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you againe.

3. And why seest thou the mote, that is in thy brothers eye, and perceiuest not the beame that is in thine owne eye?

4. Or howe sayest thou to thy brother, Suffer me to cast out the mote out of thine eye, and beholde, a beame is in thine owne eye?

5. Hypocrite, first cast out that beame out of thine owne eye, and then shalt thou see clearely to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. For whosoeuer asketh, receiueth: and he, that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.

9. For what man is there among you, which if his sonne aske him bread, woulde giue him a stone?

10. Or if he aske fish, wil he giue him a serpent?

11. If ye then, which are euill, can giue to your children good giftes, howe much more shall your Father which is in heauen, giue good thinges to them that aske him?

12. 
          

13. 
          

14. Because 

15. 
          

16. Ye shall know them by their fruites. Doe men gather grapes of thornes? or figges of thistles?

17. So euery good tree bringeth foorth good fruite, & a corrupt tree bringeth forth euill fruite.

18. A good tree can not bring forth euil fruite: neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruite.

19. Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.

20. Therefore by their fruites ye shall knowe them.

21. 
          

22. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy 

23. And then will I profess unto them, 

24. 
          

25. And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell not: for it was grounded on a rocke.

26. But whosoeuer heareth these my wordes, and doeth them not, shall be likened vnto a foolish man, which hath builded his house vpon the sand:

27. And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell, and the fall thereof was great.

28. And it came to passe, when Iesus had ended these wordes, the people were astonied at his doctrine.

29. For he taught them as one hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes.

## Matthew 8

1. Nowe when he was come downe from the mountaine, great multitudes followed him.

2. 
          

3. And Iesus putting foorth his hand, touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleane: and immediately his leprosie was clensed.

4. Then Iesus saide vnto him, See thou tell no man, but goe, and shewe thy selfe vnto the Priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a witnesse to them.

5. 
          

6. And saide, Master, my seruant lieth sicke at home of the palsie, and is grieuously pained.

7. And Iesus saide vnto him, I will come and heale him.

8. But the Centurion answered, saying, Master, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe: but speake the worde onely, and my seruant shall be healed.

9. For I am a man also vnder the authoritie of an other, and haue souldiers vnder me: and I say to one, Goe, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and he commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth it.

10. When Iesus heard that, he marueiled, and said to them that folowed him, Verely, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, euen in Israel.

11. And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall 

12. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into 

13. Then Iesus saide vnto the Centurion, Goe thy way, and as thou hast beleeued, so be it vnto thee, And his seruant was healed the same houre.

14. 
          

15. And he touched her hande, and the feuer left her: so she arose, and ministred vnto them.

16. When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with [his] word, and healed 

17. That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, He tooke our infirmities, and bare our sickenesses.

18. Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the 

19. 
          

20. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] 

21. 
          

22. But Iesus said vnto him, Followe me, and let the dead burie their dead.

23. 
          

24. And beholde, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was couered with waues: but he was a sleepe.

25. Then his disciples came, and awoke him, saying, Master, saue vs: we perish.

26. And he said vnto them, Why are ye fearefull, O ye of litle faith? Then he arose, & rebuked the winds & the sea: & so there was a great calme.

27. And the men marueiled, saying, What man is this, that both the windes and the sea obey him!

28. 
          

29. And beholde, they cryed out, saying, Iesus the sonne of God, what haue we to do with thee? Art thou come hither to tormet vs before ye time?

30. And there was 

31. And the deuils besought him, saying, If thou cast vs out, suffer vs to goe into the heard of swine.

32. And he said vnto them, Go. So they went out and departed into the heard of swine: and beholde, the whole heard of swine ranne headlong into the sea, and died in the water.

33. Then the heardmen fled: and when they were come into the citie, they tolde all things, and what was become of them that were possessed with the deuils.

34. And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought [him] that he would

3. And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This [man] 

4. But when Iesus saw their thoughts, he said, Wherefore thinke yee euil things in your hearts?

5. For whether is it easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, or to say, Arise, and walke?

6. And that ye may knowe that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue sinnes, (then saide he vnto the sicke of the palsie,) Arise, take vp thy bed, and goe to thine house.

7. And hee arose, and departed to his owne house.

8. So when the multitude sawe it, they marueiled, and glorified God, which had giuen such authoritie to men.

9. 
          

10. And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and 

11. And when the Pharises sawe that, they saide to his disciples, Why eateth your master with Publicanes and sinners?

12. Nowe when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole neede not a Physition, but they that are sicke.

13. But goe yee and learne what this is, I will haue mercie, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.

14. 
          

15. And Jesus said unto them, Can the 

16. No man putteth a piece of

18. 
          

19. And Iesus arose and followed him with his disciples.

20. (And beholde, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue yeres, came behinde him, and touched the hemme of his garment.

21. For shee saide in her selfe, If I may touche but his garment onely, I shalbe whole.

22. Then Iesus turned him about, and seeing her, did say, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; the woman was made whole at that same moment.)

23. 
          

24. He said vnto them, Get you hence: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth; they laughed him to scorne.

25. And when the multitude were put foorth, hee went in and tooke her by the hande, and the maide arose.

26. And this bruite went throughout all that lande.

27. 
          

28. And when hee was come into the house, the blinde came to him, & Iesus saide vnto them, Beleeue yee that I am able to doe this? And they sayd vnto him, Yea, Lord.

29. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it vnto you.

30. And their eyes were opened, and Iesus gaue them great charge, saying, See that no man knowe it.

31. But when they were departed, they spread abroad his fame throughout all that land.

32. 
          

33. And when the deuill was cast out, the domme spake: then the multitude marueiled, saying, The like was neuer seene in Israel.

34. But the Pharises saide, He casteth out deuils, through the prince of deuils.

35. And Iesus went about all cities and townes, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing euery sickenesse and euery disease among the people.

36. 
          

37. Then saide he to his disciples, Surely the haruest is great, but the labourers are fewe.

5. These twelue did Iesus send forth, & commaunded them, saying, Goe not into the way of of the Gentiles, and into the cities of the Samaritans enter yee not:

4. And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Goe, and shewe Iohn, what things ye heare, and see.

11. And he said vnto the, What man shall there be among you, that hath a sheepe, & if it fal on a Sabbath day into a pit, doth not take it & lift it out?

12. How much more then is a man better then a sheepe? Therefore, it is lawfull to doe well on a Sabbath day.

13. Then said he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand; he stretched it foorth, and it was made whole as the other.

## Matthew 13

1. The same day went Iesus out of the house, and sate by the sea side.

2. 
          

3. Then he spake many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sowe.

4. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the foules came and deuoured them vp.

5. And some fell vpon stony grounde, where they had not much earth, and anon they sprong vp, because they had no depth of earth.

6. And when the sunne was vp, they were parched, and for lacke of rooting, withered away.

7. And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprong vp, and choked them.

8. Some againe fel in good ground, & brought forth fruite, one corne an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and another thirtie folde.

9. He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.

10. Then the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?

11. 
          

12. For whosoeuer hath, to him shalbe giuen, and he shall haue abundance: but whosoeuer hath not, from him shalbe taken away, euen that he hath.

13. Therefore speake I to them in parables, because they seeing, doe not see: and hearing, they heare not, neither vnderstand.

14. So in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias, which prophecie saieth, By hearing, ye shall heare, and shall not vnderstand, and seeing, ye shal see, and shall not perceiue.

15. For this peoples heart is waxed fat, & their eares are dull of hearing, and with their eyes they haue winked, lest they should see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, & should vnderstand with their hearts, & should returne, that I might heale them.

16. 
          

17. For verely I say vnto you, that many Prophets, & righteous men haue desired to see those things which ye see, & haue not seene them, & to heare those things which ye heare, and haue not heard them.

18. Heare ye therefore ye parable of ye sower.

19. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, then cometh the wicked [one], and catcheth away that which was sown in his 

20. And hee that receiued seede in the stonie grounde, is he which heareth the woorde, and incontinently with ioy receiueth it,

21. Yet hath he no roote in himselfe, and dureth but a season: for assoone as tribulation or persecution commeth because of the woorde, by and by he is offended.

22. And hee that receiued the seede among thornes, is hee that heareth the woorde: but the care of this worlde, and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the word, and he is made vnfruitfull.

23. But he that receiued the seede in the good ground, is he that heareth the worde, and vnderstandeth it, which also beareth fruite, and bringeth foorth, some an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and some thirtie folde.

24. 
          

25. But while men slept, there came his enemie, and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his waie.

26. And when the blade was sprong vp, and brought forth fruite, then appeared the tares also.

27. Then came the seruaunts of the housholder, and sayd vnto him, Master, sowedst not thou good seede in thy fielde? from whence then hath it tares?

28. And hee said to them, Some enuious man hath done this. Then the seruants saide vnto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them vp?

29. But he saide, Nay, lest while yee goe about to gather the tares, yee plucke vp also with them the wheat.

30. Let both growe together vntill the haruest, and in time of haruest I will say to the reapers, Gather yee first the tares, and binde them in sheaues to burne them: but gather the wheate into my barne.

31. 
          

32. Which in deede is the least of all seedes: but when it is growen, it is the greatest among herbes, and it is a tree, so that the birdes of heauen come and builde in the branches thereof.

33. Another parable spake hee to them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meale, till all be leauened.

34. All these thinges spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without parables spake he not to them,

35. That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and will vtter the thinges which haue beene kept secrete from the foundation of the worlde.

36. Then sent Iesus the multitude away, and went into the house; his disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of that fielde.

37. 
          

38. And the field is the worlde, and the good seede are the children of the kingdome, and the tares are the children of that wicked one.

39. And the enemie that soweth them, is the deuill, and the haruest is the end of the worlde, and the reapers be the Angels.

40. As then the tares are gathered and burned in ye fire, so shal it be in the end of this world.

41. The Sonne of man shal send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie,

42. And shall cast them into a fornace of fire. There shalbe wailing and gnashing of teeth.

43. Then shall the iust men shine as ye sunne in the kingdome of their Father. Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare.

44. 
          

45. Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, that seeketh good pearles,

46. Who hauing found a pearle of great price, went and solde all that he had, and bought it.

47. 
          

48. Which, when it is full, men draw to lande, and sit and gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away.

49. So shall it be at the end of the world. The Angels shall goe foorth, and seuer the bad from among the iust,

50. And shall cast them into a fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and gnashing of teeth.

51. 
          

52. Then sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an householder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things both newe and olde.

53. And it came to passe, that when Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence,

54. 
          

55. Is not this the carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie, and his brethren Iames and Ioses, and Simon and Iudas?

56. And are not his sisters all with vs? Whence then hath he all these things?

57. And they were offended with him. Then Iesus said to them, A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne countrey, and in his owne house.

58. And he did not many great woorkes there, for their vnbeliefes sake.

3. For Herod had taken Iohn, and bounde him, and put him in prison for Herodias sake, his brother Philips wife.

4. For Iohn saide vnto him, It is not lawfull for thee to haue her.

5. And when hee woulde haue put him to death, hee feared the multitude, because they counted him as a Prophet.

6. But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased 

7. Wherefore he promised with an othe, that he would giue her whatsoeuer she would aske.

8. And shee being before instructed of her mother, sayde, Giue mee here Iohn Baptists head in a platter.

9. And the King was sorie: neuerthelesse because of the othe, and them that sate with him at the table, he commanded it to be giuen her,

10. And sent, and beheaded Iohn in the prison.

11. And his head was brought in a platter, and giuen to the maide, and shee brought it vnto her mother.

12. And his disciples came, and tooke vp the bodie, and buried it, and went, and tolde Iesus.

13. And when Iesus heard it, hee departed thence by shippe into a desert place apart; when the multitude had heard it, they followed him on foote out of the cities.

14. 
          

15. And when euen was come, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desart place, and the time is alreadie past: let the multitude depart, that they may goe into the townes, and bye them vitailes.

16. But Iesus saide to them, They haue no neede to goe away: giue yee them to eate.

17. Then saide they vnto him, Wee haue here but fiue loaues, and two fishes.

18. And he saide, Bring them hither to me.

19. And hee commanded the multitude to sit downe on the grasse, and tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen and blessed, and brake, and gaue the loaues to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

20. And they did all eate, and were sufficed, and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, twelue baskets full.

21. And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousande men, beside women and litle children.

22. And straightway Iesus compelled his disciples to enter into a shippe, and to goe ouer before him, while he sent the multitude away.

23. And assoone as hee had sent the multitude away, he went vp into a moutaine alone to pray: and when the euening was come, hee was there alone.

24. 
          

25. And in the

28. 
          

29. And he saide, Come; when Peter was come downe out of the shippe, he walked on the water, to goe to Iesus.

30. But when he sawe a mightie winde, he was afraide: and as he began to sinke, he cried, saying, Master, saue me.

31. So immediatly Iesus stretched foorth his hande, and caught him, and saide to him, O thou of litle faith, wherefore diddest thou doubt?

32. And assoone as they were come into the ship, the winde ceased.

33. Then they that were in the ship, came and worshipped him, saying, Of a trueth thou art the Sonne of God.

34. And when they were gone over, they came into the land of

10. 
          

11. That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.

12. Then came his disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest thou not, that the Pharises are offended in hearing this saying?

13. But hee answered and saide, Euery plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp.

14. Let them alone, they be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall fall into the ditche.

15. Then answered Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs this parable.

16. Then said Iesus, Are ye yet without vnderstanding?

17. Perceiue ye not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the draught?

18. But those thinges which proceede out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man.

19. For out of the heart come euil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders.

20. These are the things, which defile the man: but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth not ye man.

21. Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the

27. But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table.

28. Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest; her daughter was made whole at that houre.

29. 
          

30. And great multitudes came unto him, having with them [those that were] lame, blind, dumb,

32. 
          

33. And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude!

34. And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, & a few litle fishes.

35. And he commanded the multitude to

11. For the Sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost.

12. How thinke ye? If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doeth he not leaue ninetie & nine, & go into the mountaines, and seeke that which is gone astray?

13. And if so be that he finde it, verely I say vnto you, he reioyceth more of that sheepe, then of the ninetie and nine which went not astray:

14. So is it not ye wil of your Father which is in heauen, that one of these litle ones should perish.

23. Thereefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine King, which would take an account of his seruants.

24. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him 

25. And because he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be solde, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the dette to be payed.

26. The servant therefore fell down, and 

27. Then that seruants Lord had compassion, and loosed him, and forgaue him the dette.

28. But when the seruant was departed, hee found one of his felow seruants, which ought him an hundred pence, & he layde hands on him, and thratled him, saying, Pay me that thou owest.

29. Then his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete, and besought him, saying, Refraine thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all.

30. Yet he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the dette.

31. And when his other felowe seruants sawe what was done, they were very sory, & came, and declared vnto their Lord all that was done.

32. Then his Lord called him vnto him, and sayd to him, O euil seruant, I forgaue thee all that dette, because thou prayedst me.

33. Oughtest not thou also to haue had pitie on thy fellowe seruant, euen as I had pitie on thee?

34. So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentours, till he should pay all that was due to him.

35. So likewise shall mine heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye forgiue from your hearts, eche one to his brother their trespasses.

15. And when he had put his hands on them, he departed thence.

17. And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, eue God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keepe ye commandemets.

18. He sayd to him, Which? And Iesus sayde, These, Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse.

19. Honour thy father and mother: and thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.

20. The yong man sayd vnto him, I haue obserued all these things from my youth: what lacke I yet?

21. Jesus said unto him, If

27. Then answered Peter, and said to him, Beholde, we haue forsaken all, and followed thee: what therefore shall we haue?

28. 
          

29. And whosoeuer shal forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Names sake, he shall receiue an hundreth folde more, and shall inherite euerlasting life.

9. And they which were hired about ye eleuenth houre, came and receiued euery man a penie.

10. Nowe when the first came, they supposed that they should receiue more, but they likewise receiued euery man a penie.

11. And when they had receiued it, they murmured against the master of the house,

13. And hee answered one of them, saying, Friend, I doe thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penie?

28. Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? For all had her.

29. Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

30. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the

43. Of this be sure, that if the good man of the house knewe at what watch the thiefe would come, he woulde surely watch, and not suffer his house to be digged through.

44. Therefore be ye also ready: for in the houre that ye thinke not, will the Sonne of man come.

45. Who then is a faithfull seruaunt and wise, whom his master hath made ruler ouer his household, to giue them meate in season?

46. Blessed is that seruant, whom his master when he commeth, shall finde so doing.

47. Verely I say vnto you, he shall make him ruler ouer all his goods.

48. But if that euil seruant shal say in his heart, My master doth deferre his comming,

9. But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there will not be ynough for vs and you: but goe ye rather to them that sell, and bye for your selues.

10. And while they went to bye, the bridegrome came: and they that were readie, went in with him to the wedding, and the gate was shut.

11. Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs.

19. But after a long season, the master of those seruants came, and reckoned with them.

20. Then came he that had receiued fiue talents, and brought other fiue talents, saying, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me fiue talents: behold, I haue gained with them other fiue talents.

21. His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: 

22. Also he that had receiued two talents, came, and said, Master, thou deliueredst vnto me two talents: behold, I haue gained two other talets more.

23. His master saide vnto him, It is well done good seruant, and faithfull, Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will make thee ruler ouer much: enter into thy masters ioy.

24. Then he which had receiued the one talent, came, & said, Master, I knewe that thou wast an hard man, which reapest where thou sowedst not, and gatherest where thou strawedst not:

25. I was therefore afraide, and went, & hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine owne.

26. And his master answered, & said vnto him, Thou euill seruant, and slouthfull, thou knewest that I reape where I sowed not, and gather where I strawed not.

27. Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the 

28. Take therefore the talent from him, and giue it vnto him which hath tenne talents.

29. For vnto euery man that hath, it shall be giuen, and he shall haue abundance, and from him that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe taken away.

30. Cast therefore that vnprofitable seruant into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnasshing of teeth.

31. 
          

32. And before him shalbe gathered all nations, & he shal seperate them one from another, as a shepheard separateth the sheepe from ye goates.

33. And he shall set the sheepe on his right hand, and the goates on the left.

34. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye 

35. For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me drinke: I was a stranger, and ye tooke me in vnto you.

36. I was naked, & ye clothed me: I was sicke, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came vnto me.

37. Then shall the righteous answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or a thirst, and gaue thee drinke?

38. And when sawe we thee a stranger, and tooke thee in vnto vs? or naked, & clothed thee?

39. Or when sawe we thee sicke, or in prison, and came vnto thee?

40. And the King shall answere, and say vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye haue done it vnto one of the least of these my brethre, ye haue done it to me.

41. Then shal he say vnto them on ye left hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the deuill and his angels.

42. For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me no meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me no drinke:

43. I was a stranger, & ye tooke me not in vnto you: I was naked, & ye clothed me not: sicke, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

44. Then shall they also answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an hungred, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison, and did not minister vnto thee?

45. Then shall he answere them, and say, Verely I say vnto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

46. And these shall goe into euerlasting paine, and the righteous into life eternall.

## Matthew 26

1. And 

2. 
          

3. Then assembled together the chiefe Priests, and the Scribes, and the Elders of ye people into the hall of the high Priest called Caiaphas:

4. And consulted together that they might take Iesus by subtiltie, and kill him.

5. But they said, Not on the 

6. 
          

7. 
          

8. But when his 

9. For this oyntment might haue bene solde for much, and bene giuen to the poore.

10. 
          

11. 
          

12. For 

13. Verely I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this Gospel shall bee preached throughout all the worlde, there shall also this that shee hath done, be spoken of for a memoriall of her.

14. Then one of the twelue, called Iudas Iscariot, went vnto the chiefe Priestes,

15. And said, What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you? And they appoynted vnto him thirtie pieces of siluer.

16. And from that time, he sought opportunitie to betraie him.

17. 
          

18. And he said, Goe yee into the citie to such a man, and say to him, The master saieth, My time is at hande: I will keepe the Passeouer at thine house with my disciples.

19. And the disciples did as Iesus had giuen them charge, and made readie the Passeouer.

20. Now when the even was come, he 

21. And as they did eate, he sayde, Verely I say vnto you, that one of you shall betraie me.

22. And they were exceeding sorowfull, and began euery one of them to say vnto him, Is it I, Master?

23. And he answered and said, He that 

24. Surely the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe be to that man, by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had bene good for that man, if hee had neuer bene borne.

25. Then Judas, 

26. 
          

27. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye 

28. 
          

29. I say vnto you, that I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the vine vntil that day, when I shal drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome.

30. And when they had sung 

31. 
          

32. But after I am risen againe, I will go before you into Galile.

33. But Peter aunswered, and sayde vnto him, Though that al men should be offended by thee, yet will I neuer be offended.

34. Iesus sayde vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, that this night, before the cocke crow, thou shalt denie me thrise.

35. Peter saide vnto him, Though I should die with thee, I will in no case denie thee. Likewise also sayd all the disciples.

36. 
          

37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and 

38. 
          

39. And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, 

40. 
          

41. Watch, and praie, that yee enter not into tentation: the spirit in deede is readie, but the flesh is weake.

42. Againe he went away the second time, and praied, saying, O my Father, if this cuppe can not passe away from mee, but that I must drinke it, thy will be done.

43. And he came, and founde them a sleepe againe, for their eyes were heauie.

44. So he left them and went away againe, and praied the third time, saying the same woordes.

45. Then came he to his disciples, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, & take your rest: behold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners.

46. 
          

47. And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, 

48. Now he that betraied him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomesoeuer I shall kisse, that is he, laie holde on him.

49. And forthwith he came to Iesus, and sayd, God saue thee, Master, and kissed him.

50. 
          

51. And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hand, & drewe his sworde, and strooke a seruaunt of the high Priest, and smote off his eare.

52. 
          

53. 
          

54. 
          

55. The same houre sayde Iesus to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were against a thiefe, with swordes and staues to take mee: I sate daily teaching in the Temple among you, and yee tooke me not.

56. But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsooke him, and fled.

57. 
          

58. But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's 

59. Nowe the chiefe Priestes and the Elders, and all the whole councill sought false witnesse against Iesus, to put him to death.

60. But they founde none, and though many false witnesses came, yet founde they none: but at the last came two false witnesses,

61. And saide, This man saide, I can destroie the Temple of God, and build it in three daies.

62. And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? 

63. But Iesus helde his peace. Then the chiefe Priest answered, and saide to him, I charge thee sweare vnto vs by the liuing God, to tell vs, If thou be that Christ the Sonne of God, or no.

64. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, 

65. Then the high priest 

66. What thinke yee? They answered, and said, He is guiltie of death.

67. Then spet they in his face, and buffeted him, and other smote him with roddes,

68. Saying, Prophecie to vs, O Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

69. 
          

70. But hee denied before them all, saying, I wote not what thou saiest.

71. And when hee went out into the porche, another maide sawe him, and sayde vnto them that were there, This man was also with Iesus of Nazareth.

72. And againe he denied with an oth, saying, I knowe not the man.

73. So after a while, came vnto him they that stoode by, and sayde vnto Peter, Surely thou art also one of them: for euen thy speache bewraieth thee.

74. Then began he to 

75. Then Peter remembred the wordes of Iesus, which had sayde vnto him, Before the cocke crowe thou shalt denie me thrise. So he went out, and wept bitterly.

## Matthew 27

1. Vvhen the morning was come, all the chiefe Priests, and the elders of the people tooke counsell against Iesus, to put him to death,

2. And led him away bounde, and deliuered him vnto Pontius Pilate the gouernour.

3. 
          

4. Saying, I haue sinned, betraying the innocent bloud. But they sayde, What is that to vs? see thou to it.

5. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and 

6. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the 

7. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury 

8. Wherefore that field is called, The field of bloud, vntill this day.

9. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by 

10. And they gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lord appointed me.)

11. 
          

12. And when he was accused of the chiefe Priestes, and Elders, he answered nothing.

13. Then saide Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou not howe many things they lay against thee?

14. But he answered him not to one worde, in so much that the gouernour marueiled greatly.

15. 
          

16. And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

17. When they were then gathered together, Pilate said vnto the, Whether will ye that I let loose vnto you Barabbas, or Iesus which is called Christ?

18. (For he knewe well, that for enuie they had deliuered him.

19. Also when he was set downe vpon the iudgement seate, his wife sent to him, saying, Haue thou nothing to do with that iust man: for I haue suffered many things this day in a dreame by reason of him.)

20. But the chiefe Priestes and the Elders had persuaded the people that they shoulde aske Barabbas, and should destroy Iesus.

21. Then the gouernour answered, and said vnto them, Whether of the twaine will ye that I let loose vnto you? And they said, Barabbas.

22. Pilate said vnto them, What shal I do then with Iesus, which is called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified.

23. Then saide the gouernour, But what euill hath he done? Then they cryed the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

24. 
          

25. Then answered all the people, and said, 

26. Thus let he Barabbas loose vnto them, and scourged Iesus, and deliuered him to be crucified.

27. Then the souldiers of the gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and gathered about him the whole band,

28. 
          

29. And platted a crowne of thornes, and put it vpon his head, and a reede in his right hand, and bowed their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, God saue thee King of the Iewes,

30. And spitted vpon him, and tooke a reede, and smote him on the head.

31. Thus when they had mocked him, they tooke the robe from him, and put his owne rayment on him, and led him away to crucifie him.

32. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they 

33. 
          

34. 
          

35. 
          

36. And they sate, and watched him there.

37. 
          

38. 
          

39. 
          

40. And saying, Thou that destroyest ye Temple, & buildest it in three dayes, saue thy selfe: if thou be ye Sonne of God, come downe fro ye crosse.

41. Likewise also the hie Priests mocking him, with the Scribes, and Elders, and Pharises, said,

42. He saued others, but he cannot saue him selfe: if he be ye King of Israel, let him now come downe from ye crosse, and we will beleeue in him.

43. He trusted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him: for he saide, I am the Sonne of God.

44. The 

45. 
          

46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou 

47. Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that], said, This [man] calleth for 

48. And straightway one of them ran, & tooke a spondge, and filled it with vineger, and put it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke.

49. Other said, Let be: let vs see, if Elias wil come and saue him.

50. 
          

51. 
          

52. And the 

53. And came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy citie, and appeared vnto many.

54. When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Iesus, saw the earthquake, and the thinges that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truely this was the Sonne of God.

55. And many women were there, beholding him a farre off, which had folowed Iesus from Galile, ministring vnto him.

56. Among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of Iames, & Ioses, and the mother of Zebedeus sonnes.

57. 
          

58. He went to Pilate, & asked ye body of Iesus. Then Pilate commanded ye body to be deliuered.

59. So Ioseph tooke the body, and wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth,

60. And put it in his new tombe, which he had hewen out in a rocke, and rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre, and departed.

61. And there was Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie sitting ouer against the sepulchre.

62. 
          

63. And said, Syr, we remember that that deceiuer saide, while he was yet aliue, Within three dayes I will rise.

64. Command therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure vntill the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steale him away, and say vnto the people, He is risen from the dead: so shall the last errour be worse then the first.

65. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a 

66. And they went, and made the sepulchre sure with the watch, and sealed the stone.

## Matthew 28

1. In 

2. And behold, there was a great earthquake: for the Angel of the Lorde descended from heauen, and came and rolled backe the stone from the doore, and sate vpon it.

3. His 

4. And for feare of him, the keepers were astonied, and became as dead men.

5. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not 

6. He is not here, for he is risen; as he saide: come, see the place where the Lord was laid,

7. And go quickly, & tel his disciples that he is risen fro ye dead: & behold, he goeth before you into Galile: there ye shall see him: loe, I haue told you.

8. So they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with feare and great ioye, and did runne to bring his disciples worde.

9. 
          

10. Then said Iesus vnto them, Be not afraide. Goe, and tell my brethren, that they goe into Galile, and there shall they see me.

11. 
          

12. And they gathered them together with the Elders, and tooke counsell, and gaue large money vnto the souldiers,

13. Saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.

14. And if this 

15. So they tooke the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is noysed among the Iewes vnto this day.

16. 
          

17. And when they sawe him, they worshipped him: but some douted.

18. And Iesus came, and spake vnto them, saying, All power is giuen vnto me, in heauen, and in earth.

19. 
          

20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you
