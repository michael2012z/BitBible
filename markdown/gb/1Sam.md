1. Now there was a certain man of

3. And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in

5. But unto Hannah he gave a worthy 

6. And her aduersarie vexed her sore, forasmuch as she vpbraided her, because the Lorde had made her barren.

7. (And so did he yeere by yeere) and as oft as she went vp to the house of the Lord, thus she vexed her, that she wept and did not eate.

8. Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? [am] not I better to thee than ten 

9. So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the 

10. And she was troubled in her minde, and prayed vnto the Lord, and wept sore:

11. Also she vowed a vowe, and sayd, O Lord of hostes, if thou wilt looke on the trouble of thine handmaide, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaide, but giue vnto thine handmaide a manchilde, then I will giue him vnto the Lord all the dayes of his life, and there shall no rasor come vpon his head.

12. And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli marked her mouth.

13. For Hannah spake in her heart: her lips did moue onely, but her voyce was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had bene drunken.

14. And Eli sayde vnto her, Howe long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy drunkennesse from thee.

15. Then Hannah answered and sayd, Nay my lord, but I am a woman troubled in spirit: I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke, but haue powred out my soule before the Lord.

16. Count not thine handmaide for a wicked woman: for of the abundance of my complaint and my griefe haue I spoken hitherto.

17. Then Eli answered, and sayd, Go in peace, and the God of Israel graunt thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

18. And she said, Let thine handmaid find 

19. And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD 

20. For in processe of time Hannah conceiued, and bare a sonne, and she called his name Samuel, Because, said she, I haue asked him of the Lord.

21. And the man 

22. But Hannah went not vp: for she sayd vnto her husband, I will tarie vntill the childe be weined, then I will bring him that hee may appeare before the Lord, and there abide for euer.

23. And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his 

24. And when she had weined him, she tooke him with her with three bullockes and an Ephah of floure and a bottell of wine, and brought him vnto the house of the Lorde in Shiloh, and the childe was yong.

25. And they slewe a bullocke, and brought the childe to Eli.

26. And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy 

27. I prayed for this childe, and the Lord hath giuen me my desire which I asked of him.

28. Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he

19. And his mother made him a litle coat, and brought it to him from yeere to yeere, when she came vp with her husband, to offer the yerely sacrifice.

20. And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord giue thee seede of this woman, for the petition that she asked of the Lord: and they departed vnto their place.

21. And the Lorde visited Hannah, so that she conceiued, & bare three sonnes, & two daughters; the childe Samuel grewe before the Lord.

22. Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that

29. Wherefore

6. And the Lorde called once againe, Samuel; Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, I am here: for thou diddest call me; he answered, I called thee not, my sonne: go againe and sleepe.

7. Now Samuel did not yet know 

8. And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli 

9. Therefore Eli saide vnto Samuel, Goe and sleepe: and if he call thee, then say, Speake Lorde, for thy seruant heareth. So Samuel went, and slept in his place.

10. And the Lord came, and stoode, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speake, for thy seruant heareth.

11. And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall

14. And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for

16. Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel my sonne; he answered, Here I am.

17. And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God 

18. So Samuel tolde him euery whit, and hid nothing from him. Then hee said, It is the Lorde: let him do what seemeth him good.

19. And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words

21. And the Lorde appeared againe in Shiloh: for the Lorde reueiled himselfe to Samuel in Shiloh by his word.

## 1 Samuel 4

1. And Samuel spake vnto all Israel: and Israel went out against the Philistims to battel and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistims pitched in Aphek.

2. And the Philistims put themselues in aray against Israel: and when they ioyned the battell, Israel was smitten downe before the Philistims: who slewe of the armie in the fielde about foure thousand men.

3. And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, 

4. So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which 

5. And when the Arke of the couenant of the Lord came into the hoste, all Israel shouted a mightie shoute, so that the earth rang againe.

6. And when the Philistims heard the noyse of the shoute, they said, What meaneth the sound of this mightie shoute in the host of the Ebrewes? and they vnderstoode, that the Arke of the Lord was come into the hoste.

7. And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, 

8. Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these [are] the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the 

9. Be strong and play the men, O Philistims, that ye be not seruants vnto the Ebrewes, as they haue serued you: be valiant therefore, and fight.

10. And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel 

11. And the Arke of God was taken, and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas died.

12. And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes 

13. And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart 

14. And when Eli heard the noyse of the crying, he sayd, What meaneth this noyse of the tumult? and the man came in hastily, and tolde Eli.

15. (Nowe Eli was fourescore and eighteene yeere olde, and his eyes were dimme that hee could not see)

16. And the man sayd vnto Eli, I came from the armie, and I fled this day out of the hoste: and he sayd, What thing is done, my sonne?

17. And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, 

18. And when he had made mention of the Arke of God, Eli fell from his seate backward by the side of the gate, and his necke was broken, and he dyed: for he was an olde man and heauie: and he had iudged Israel fourtie yeeres.

19. And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, [near] to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she 

20. And about the time of her death, the women that stoode about her, sayd vnto her, Feare not: for thou hast borne a sonne: but she answered not, nor regarded it.

21. And she named the childe Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel, because the Arke of God was taken, and because of her father in lawe and her husband.

22. And she said,

4. Also they rose vp earely in the morning the next day, and beholde, Dagon was fallen vpon his face on the ground before the Arke of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and the two palmes of his hands were cut off vpon the thresholde: onely the stumpe of Dagon was left to him.

5. Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, 

6. But the hand of the Lord was heauie vpon them of Ashdod, and destroyed them, and smote them with the emerods, both Ashdod, and the coastes thereof.

7. And when the men of Ashdod sawe this, they sayd, Let not the Arke of the God of Israel abide with vs: for his hand is sore vpon vs and vpon Dagon our god.

8. They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, 

9. And when they had caried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the citie with a very great destruction, and he smote the men of the citie both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret partes.

10. Therefore they sent the Arke of God to Ekron: and assoone as the Arke of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cryed out, saying, They haue brought the Arke of the God of Israel to vs to slay vs and our people.

11. So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send 

12. And the men that dyed not, were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the citie went vp to heauen.

## 1 Samuel 6

1. And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines 

2. And the Philistims called the priests and the soothsayers, saying, What shall we doe with the Arke of the Lord? tell vs wherewith we shall send it home againe.

3. And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him 

4. Then sayd they, What shalbe the sinne offring, which we shall giue vnto it? And they answered, Fiue golden emerods and fiue golden mise, according to the number of the princes of the Philistims: for one plague was on you all, and on your princes.

5. Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your 

6. Wherefore then should ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let them goe, and they departed?

7. Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on whome there hath come no yoke: and tye the kine to the cart, and bring the calues home from them.

8. And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the

10. And the men did so: for they tooke two kine that gaue milke, and tied them to the cart, and shut the calues at home.

11. So they set the Arke of the Lord vpon the cart, and the coffer with the mise of golde, and with the similitudes of their emerods.

12. And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, [and] went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside [to] the right hand or [to] the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after 

13. Nowe they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheate haruest in the valley, and they lift vp their eyes, and spied the Arke, and reioyced when they sawe it.

14. And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where [there was] a great stone: and 

15. And the Leuites tooke downe the Arke of the Lord, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the iewels of golde were, and put them on the great stone, and the men of Beth-shemesh offred burnt offring, and sacrificed sacrifices that same day vnto the Lord.

16. And when the fiue Princes of ye Philistims had seene it, they returned to Ekron the same day.

17. And these [are] the golden emerods which the Philistines returned [for] a trespass offering unto the LORD; for 

18. And golden mise, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistims, belonging to the fiue princes, both of walled townes, and of townes vnwalled, vnto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set the Arke of the Lorde: which stone remaineth vnto this day in the fielde of Ioshua the Beth-shemite.

19. And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they 

20. Wherefore the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go from vs?

21. And they sent messengers to the inhabitans of Kiriath-iearim, saying, The Philistims haue brought againe the Arke of the Lord: come ye downe and take it vp to you.

3. Then Samuel spake vnto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye be come againe vnto the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods from among you, and Ashtaroth, & direct your hearts vnto the Lord, & serue him only, and he shall deliuer you out of the hand of ye Philistims.

4. Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim & Ashtaroth, & serued the Lord onely.

5. And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to 

6. And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and 

7. When the Philistims heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the princes of the Philistims went vp against Israel: and when the children of Israel heard that, they were afraide of the Philistims.

8. And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to 

9. Then Samuel tooke a sucking lambe, and offered it all together for a burnt offering vnto the Lord, and Samuel cryed vnto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.

10. And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD 

11. And the men of Israel went from Mizpeh and pursued the Philistims, and smote them vntill they came vnder Beth-car.

12. Then Samuel took a stone, and set [it] between Mizpeh and 

13. So the Philistims were brought vnder, and they came no more againe into the coastes of Israel: and the hand of the Lorde was against the Philistims all the dayes of Samuel.

14. And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the 

15. And Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his life,

16. And went about yeere by yere to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and iudged Israel in all those places.

4. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto 

5. And said vnto him, Beholde, thou art olde, and thy sonnes walke not in thy wayes: make vs nowe a King to iudge vs like all nations.

6. But the thing 

7. And the Lord said vnto Samuel, Heare the voyce of the people in all that they shall say vnto thee: for they haue not cast thee away, but they haue cast me away, that I should not reigne ouer the.

8. As they haue euer done since I brought them out of Egypt euen vnto this day, (and haue forsaken me, and serued other gods) euen so doe they vnto thee.

9. Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet 

10. So Samuel told all the wordes of the Lord vnto the people that asked a King of him.

11. And he said, This will be the 

12. Also he will make them his captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer fifties, and to eare his ground, and to reape his haruest, and to make instruments of warre, and the thinges that serue for his charets.

13. He will also take your daughters and make them apoticaries, and cookes, and bakers.

14. And he will take your fieldes, & your vineyardes, and your best Oliue trees, and giue them to his seruants.

15. And he will take the tenth of your seede, and of your vineyards, & giue it to his Eunuches, and to his seruants.

16. And he will take your men seruants, and your maide seruants, and the chiefe of your yong men, and your asses, and put them to his worke.

17. He will take the tenth of your sheepe, and ye shall be his seruants.

18. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not

20. And we also will be like all other nations, and our King shall iudge vs, and goe out before vs, and fight our battels.

21. Therefore when Samuel heard all ye wordes of ye people, he rehearsed the in ye eares of ye Lord.

11. And as they were going vp the hie way to the citie, they found maydes that came out to draw water, & said vnto them, Is there here a Seer?

12. And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a

11. Therefore all the people that knewe him before, when they saw that he prophecied among the Prophets, saide eche to other, What is come vnto the sonne of Kish? is Saul also among the Prophets?

19. But ye haue this day cast away your God, who onely deliuereth you out of all your aduersities and tribulations: and ye said vnto him, No, but appoint a King ouer vs. Nowe therefore stand ye before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your thousands.

20. And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was 

21. Afterwarde he assembled the tribe of Beniamin according to their families, and the familie of Matri was taken. So Saul the sonne of Kish was taken, and when they sought him, he coulde not be found.

22. Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he

24. And Samuel saide to all the people, See ye not him, whom the Lorde hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? and all the people shouted and saide, God saue the King.

25. Then Samuel told the people 

26. Saul also went home to Gibeah, and there followed him a bande of men, whose heart God had touched,

4. Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and tolde these tidings in the eares of the people: and all the people lift vp their voices and wept.

5. And behold, Saul came following the cattell out of the fielde, and Saul saide, What aileth this people, that they weepe? And they tolde him the tidings of the men of Iabesh.

7. Nowe therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord according to all the righteousnesse of the Lorde, which he shewed to you and to your fathers.

8. After that Iaakob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried vnto the Lorde, then the Lorde sent Moses and Aaron which brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

9. And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, 

10. And they cried vnto the Lorde, and saide, We haue sinned, because we haue forsaken the Lorde, and haue serued Baalim and Ashtaroth. Nowe therefore deliuer vs out of the handes of our enemies, and we will serue thee.

11. And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, 

12. And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, 

13. Nowe therefore beholde the King whome yee haue chosen, and whome yee haue desired: loe therefore, the Lord hath set a King ouer you.

14. If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue

## 1 Samuel 13

1. Saul reigned 

2. Then Saul chose him three thousand of Israel: and two thousande were with Saul in Michmash, & in mount Beth-el, and a thousande were with Ionathan in Gibeah of Beniamin: and the rest of the people he sent euery one to his tent.

3. And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that [was] in

5. And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from 

6. And when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were in distresse ) the people hid themselues in caues, and in holdes, and in rockes, and in towres, and in pittes.

7. And [some of] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of

10. And assoone as hee had made an ende of offering the burnt offering, beholde, Samuel came: and Saul went foorth to meete him, to salute him.

11. And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were 

12. Therefore said I, The Philistims will come downe nowe vpon me to Gilgal, and I haue not made supplication vnto the Lorde. I was bolde therefore and offred a burnt offring.

13. And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy

17. And there came out of the hoste of the Philistims three bandes to destroie, one bande turned vnto the way of Ophrah vnto the lande of Shual,

18. And another company turned the way [to] Bethhoron: and 

19. Then there was no smith founde throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistims sayde, Lest the Ebrewes make them swordes or speares.

20. Wherefore all ye Israelites went downe to the Philistims, to sharpen euery man his share, his mattocke, and his axe, and his weeding hooke.

21. Yet they had a file for the shares, and for the mattockes, and for the picke forkes, and for the axes, and for to sharpen the goades.

22. So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither

## 1 Samuel 14

1. Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, 

2. And Saul taried in the border of Gibeah vnder a pomegranate tree, which was in Migron, and the people that were with him, were about sixe hundreth men.

3. And Ahiah the sonne of Ahitub, Ichabods brother, the sonne of Phinehas, the sonne of Eli, was the Lordes Priest in Shiloh, and ware an Ephod: and the people knewe not that Ionathan was gone.

4. Nowe in the way whereby Ionathan sought to go ouer to the Philistims garison, there was a sharpe rocke on the one side, and a sharpe rocke on the other side: the name of the one was called Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

5. The one rocke stretched from the North towarde Michmash, and the other was from the South toward Gibeah.

6. And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these 

7. And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that [is] in thine heart: turn thee; behold, 

8. Then said Ionathan, Beholde, we goe ouer vnto those men, and will shewe our selues vnto them.

9. 
          

10. But if they say, Come vp vnto vs, then we will goe vp: for the Lorde hath deliuered them into our hande: and this shall be a signe vnto vs.

11. And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the 

12. And the men of the garison answered Ionathan, and his armour bearer, and said, Come vp to vs: for we will shewe you a thing. Then Ionathan said vnto his armour bearer, Come vp after me: for the Lorde hath deliuered them into the hand of Israel.

13. And Jonathan climbed up upon

15. And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth 

16. Then the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Beniamin sawe: and beholde, the multitude was discomfited, and smitten as they went.

17. Therefore saide Saul vnto the people that were with him, Search nowe and see, who is gone from vs; when they had nombred, beholde, Ionathan and his armour bearer were not there.

18. And Saul said vnto Ahiah, Bring hither the Arke of God (for the Arke of God was at that time with the children of Israel)

19. And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that [was] in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, 

20. And Saul was assembled with all the people that were with him, and they came to the battell: and behold, euery mans sworde was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.

21. Moreover the Hebrews [that] were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the 

22. Also all the men of Israel which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim, when they heard, that the Philistims were fled, they followed after them in the battell.

23. And so the Lord saued Israel that day: and the battell continued vnto Beth-auen.

24. And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, 

25. And all they of the land came to a wood, where hony lay vpon the ground.

26. And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the 

27. But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that [was] in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his 

28. Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father made the people to sweare, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth sustenance this day: and the people were faint.

29. Then said Jonathan, My father hath 

30. Howe much more, if the people had eaten to day of the spoyle of their enemies which they found? for had there not bene nowe a greater slaughter among the Philistims?

31. And they smote the Philistims that day, from Michmash to Aiialon: and the people were exceeding faint.

32. So the people turned to the spoile, & tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues, and slewe them on the ground, and the people did eate them with the blood.

33. Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: 

34. Againe Saul said, Goe abroade among the people, and bid them bring me euery man his oxe, and euery man his sheepe, and slay them here, and eate and sinne not against the Lord in eating with the blood; ye people brought euery man his oxe in his hand that night, & slew them there.

35. Then Saul made an altar vnto the Lorde, and that was the first altar that he made vnto the Lord.

36. And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us 

37. So Saul asked of God, saying, Shall I goe downe after ye Philistims? wilt thou deliuer them into the hands of Israel? But he answered him not at that time.

38. And Saul said, All ye chiefe of the people, come ye hither, and knowe, and see by whom this sinne is done this day.

39. For as the Lord liueth, which saueth Israel, though it be done by Ionathan my sonne, he shall dye the death. But none of all the people answered him.

40. Then he saide vnto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other side; the people saide vnto Saul, Doe what thou thinkest best.

41. Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give 

42. And Saul saide, Cast lot betweene me and Ionathan my sonne; Ionathan was taken.

43. Then Saul said to Ionathan, Tell me what thou hast done; Ionathan tolde him, & said, I tasted a litle hony with the ende of the rod, that was in mine hand, and loe, I must die.

44. Againe Saul answered, God doe so & more also, vnlesse thou die the death, Ionathan.

45. And the people said unto Saul, 

46. Then Saul came vp from the Philistims: and the Philistims went to their owne place.

47. So Saul helde the kingdome ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on euery side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the Kings of Zobah, and against the Philistims: and whithersoeuer he went, he handled them as wicked men.

48. And he gathered an host, and smote the

52. And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: 

## 1 Samuel 15

1. Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee [to be] king over his people, over Israel: now therefore 

2. Thus saith the Lorde of hostes, I remember what Amalek did to Israel, howe they laide waite for the in ye way, as they came vp fro Egypt.

3. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but 

4. And Saul assembled ye people, and nombred them in Telaim, two hundreth thousande footemen, and ten thousand men of Iudah.

5. And Saul came to a citie of Amalek, and set watch at the riuer.

6. And Saul said unto the 

7. So Saul smote the Amalekites from Hauilah as thou commest to Shur, that is before Egypt,

8. And tooke Agag the King of the Amalekites aliue, and destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

9. But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the better sheepe, and the oxen, and the fat beasts, and the lambes, and all that was good, and they would not destroy them: but euery thing that was vile and nought worth, that they destroyed.

10. Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Samuel, saying,

12. And when Samuel arose early to meete Saul in the morning, one tolde Samuel, saying, Saul is gone to Carmel: and beholde, he hath made him there a place, from whence he returned, and departed, and is gone downe to Gilgal.

13. And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD: I have performed the 

14. But Samuel saide, What meaneth then the bleating of the sheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?

15. And Saul answered, They haue brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheepe, and of the oxen to sacrifice them vnto the Lorde thy God, and the remnant haue we destroyed.

16. Againe Samuel saide to Saul, Let me tell thee what the Lord hath saide to me this night; he said vnto him, Say on.

17. And Samuel said, When thou [wast] 

18. And the Lord sent thee on a iourney, and saide, Goe, and destroy those sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them, vntill thou destroy them.

19. Nowe wherefore hast thou not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde, but hast turned to the pray, and hast done wickedly in the sight of the Lord?

20. And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, 

21. But the people tooke of the spoyle, sheepe, and oxen, and the chiefest of the things which shoulde haue bene destroyed, to offer vnto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.

22. And Samuel saide, Hath the Lord as great pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Beholde, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fatte of rammes.

23. For 

24. Then Saul sayde vnto Samuel, I haue sinned: for I haue transgressed the commaundement of the Lord, and thy wordes, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voyce.

25. Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my 

26. But Samuel saide vnto Saul, I will not returne with thee: for thou hast cast away the word of the Lorde, and the Lorde hath cast away thee, that thou shalt not be King ouer Israel.

27. And as Samuel turned himselfe to goe away, he caught the lappe of his coate, and it rent.

28. And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a

3. And call Ishai to the sacrifice, and I will shewe thee what thou shalt doe, and thou shalt anoynt vnto me him whom I name vnto thee.

4. And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town 

5. And he answeared, Yea: I am come to doe sacrifice vnto the Lorde: sanctifie your selues, and come with me to the sacrifice; he sanctified Ishai & his sonnes, & called them to the sacrifice.

6. And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S 

7. But the Lord said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature, because I haue refused him: for God seeth not as man seeth: for ma looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.

8. Then Ishai called Abinadab, & made him come before Samuel; he saide, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.

9. Then Ishai made Shammah come; he said, Neither yet hath the Lorde chosen him.

10. Againe Ishai made his seue sonnes to come before Samuel: and Samuel saide vnto Ishai, The Lord hath chosen none of these.

11. Finally, Samuel said vnto Ishai, Are there no more children but these? And hee sayde, There remaineth yet a litle one behinde, that keepeth the sheepe. Then Samuel saide vnto Ishai, Sende and set him: for we will not sit downe, till he be come hither.

12. And he sent, and brought him in: and he was ruddie, & of a good countenance, and comely visage; the Lorde saide, Arise, and anoynt him: for this is he.

13. Then Samuel tooke the horne of oyle, and anoynted him in the middes of his brethren; the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid, from that day forwarde: then Samuel rose vp, and went to Ramah.

14. But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an

17. Saul then saide vnto his seruantes, Prouide me a man, I pray you, that can play well, & bring him to me.

18. Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a

20. And Ishai tooke an asse laden with breade and a flagon of wine and a kidde, and sent them by the hand of Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.

21. And Dauid came to Saul, and stoode before him: and he loued him verie well, and he was his armour bearer.

22. And Saul sent to Ishai, saying, Let Dauid nowe remaine with me: for he hath found fauour in my sight.

## 1 Samuel 17

1. Nowe the Philistims gathered their armies to battell, & came together to Shochoh, which is in Iudah, and pitched betweene Shochoh and Azekah, in the coast of Dammim.

2. And Saul, and the men of Israel assembled, and pitched in the valley of Elah, and put themselues in battell araie to meete the Philistims.

3. And the Philistims stoode on a mountaine on the one side, and Israel stoode on a mountaine on the other side: so a valley was betweene them.

4. And there 

5. And [he had] an helmet of brass upon his head, and he [was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat [was] five thousand 

6. And he had bootes of brasse vpon his legs, and a shield of brasse vpon his shoulders.

7. And the shaft of his speare was like a weauers beame: and his speare head weyed sixe hundreth shekels of yron: and one bearing a shielde went before him.

8. And he stoode, and cried against the hoste of Israel, and saide vnto them, Why are yee come to set your battell in aray? Am not I a Philistim, and you seruaunts to Saul? Chuse you a man for you, and let him come downe to me.

9. If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then wil we be your seruants: but if I ouercome him, and kill him, then shal yee be our seruants, and serue vs.

10. Also the Philistim saide, I defie the hoste of Israel this day: giue mee a man, that we may fight together.

11. When Saul & all Israel heard those wordes of the Philistim, they were discouraged, & greatly afraide.

12. Nowe this Dauid was the sonne of an Ephrathite of Beth-lehem Iudah, named Ishai, which had eight sonnes: and this man was taken for an olde man in the daies of Saul.

13. And the three eldest sonnes of Ishai went and followed Saul to the battel: and the names of his three sonnes that went to battell, were Eliab the Eldest, and the next Abinadab, and the thirde Shammah.

14. So Dauid was the least: and the three eldest went after Saul.

15. But David 

16. And the Philistim drew neere in the morning, and euening, and continued fourtie daies.

17. And Jesse said unto David his son, 

18. And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of [their] thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their 

19. (Then Saul and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistims)

20. So Dauid rose vp earely in the morning, and left the sheepe with a keeper, and tooke and went as Ishai had commaunded him, and came within the compasse of the hoste: and the hoste went out in araie, and shouted in the battell.

21. For Israel & the Philistims had put themselues in araie, armie against armie.

22. And Dauid left the things, which hee bare, vnder the handes of the keeper of the cariage, and ranne into the hoste, and came, and asked his brethren howe they did.

23. And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the 

24. And all the men of Israel, when they sawe the man, ranne away from him, and were sore afraied.

25. And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, [that] the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house 

26. And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the 

27. And the people answered him after this maner, saying, Thus shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

28. And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and Eliab was verie angrie with Dauid, and sayde, Why camest thou downe hither? and with whome hast thou left those fewe sheepe in the wildernesse? I knowe thy pride and the malice of thine heart, that thou art come downe to see the battell.

29. And David said, What have I now done? [Is there] not a 

30. And hee departed from him into the presence of another, and spake of the same maner, and the people answered him according to the former woordes.

31. And they that heard the wordes which Dauid spake, rehearsed them before Saul, which caused him to be brought.

32. So Dauid saide to Saul, Let no mans heart faile him, because of him: thy seruant wil goe, and fight with this Philistim.

33. And Saul said to David, Thou art not 

34. And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a

36. So thy seruaunt slue both the lyon, and the beare: therefore this vncircumcised Philistim shall be as one of them, seeing hee hath railed on the hoste of the liuing God.

37. David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, 

38. And Saul put his rayment vpon Dauid, & put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and put a brigandine vpon him.

39. Then girded Dauid his sword vpon his rayment, and began to go: for he neuer proued it: and Dauid sayde vnto Saul, I can not goe with these: for I am not accustomed. wherefore Dauid put them off him.

40. And he took his

42. Now when the Philistim looked about & saw Dauid, he disdeined him: for he was but yong, ruddie, and of a comely face.

43. And the Philistine said unto David, [Am] I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine 

44. And the Philistim sayd to Dauid, Come to me, & I will giue thy flesh vnto the foules of the heauen, and to the beastes of the field.

45. Then sayd Dauid to the Philistim, Thou commest to me with a sword, and with a speare, & with a shield, but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of hostes, the God of the hoste of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon.

46. This 

47. And that all this assembly may know, that the Lord saueth not with sworde nor with speare (for the battel is the Lords) and he will giue you into our handes.

48. And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David 

49. And Dauid put his hande in his bagge, and tooke out a stone, and slang it, & smote the Philistim in his forehead, that the stone sticked in his forehead, and he fell groueling to the earth.

50. So Dauid ouercame the Philistim with a sling & with a stone, & smote the Philistim, and slew him, when Dauid had no sword in his hand.

51. Then Dauid ranne, & stood vpon the Philistim, and tooke his sword and drew it out of his sheath, and slewe him, and cut off his head therewith. So whe the Philistims saw, that their champion was dead, they fled.

52. And the men of Israel and Iudah arose, & shouted, and followed after the Philistims, vntill they came to the valley, & vnto the gates of Ekron: and the Philistims fell downe wounded by the way of Shaaraim, euen to Gath & to Ekron.

53. And the children of Israel returned from pursuing the Philistims, & spoyled their tents.

54. And Dauid tooke the head of ye Philistim, and brought it to Ierusalem, and put his armour in his tent.

55. And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, 

56. Then the King sayde, Enquire thou whose sonne this yong man is.

57. And when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistim, then Abner tooke him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistim in his hand.

58. And Saul sayde to him, Whose sonne art thou, thou yong man? And Dauid answered, I am the sonne of thy seruant Ishai the Bethlehemite.

12. And Saul was afrayd of Dauid, because the Lord was with him, & was departed from Saul.

13. Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went

15. Wherefore when Saul saw that he was very wise, he was afrayde of him.

16. For all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid, because he went out and in before them.

17. And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and 

18. And Dauid answered Saul, What am I? and what is my life, or the family of my father in Israel, that I should be sonne in law to the King?

19. But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that

23. And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, 

24. And then Sauls seruats brought him word againe, saying, Such wordes spake Dauid.

25. And Saul sayd, This wise shal ye say to Dauid, The King desireth no dowrie, but an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims, to bee auenged of the Kings enemies: for Saul thought to make Dauid fall into the handes of the Philistims.

5. For he did put his life in daunger, and slew the Philistim, and the Lord wrought a great saluation for al Israel: thou sawest it, and thou reioycedst: wherefore then wilt thou sinne against innocent blood, and slay Dauid without a cause?

6. And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul 

7. So Ionathan called Dauid, and Ionathan shewed him all those words, & Ionathan brought Dauid to Saul, and hee was in his presence as in times past.

8. Againe the warre began, & Dauid went out & fought with the Philistims, and slew them with a great slaughter, and they fled from him.

9. And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David 

10. And Saul intended to smite Dauid to the wall with the speare: but hee turned aside out of Sauls presence, & he smote the speare against the wall: but Dauid fled, & escaped the same night.

11. Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal Dauids wife told it him, saying, If thou saue not thy selfe this night, to morowe thou shalt be slayne.

12. So Michal 

13. Then Michal tooke an image, & layde it in the bed, & put a pillow stuffed with goates heare vnder the head of it, & couered it with a cloth.

22. Then went he himselfe to Ramah, & came to a great well that is in Sechu, and he asked, and sayd, Where are Samuel and Dauid? & one sayd, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

3. And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, [there is] but a

15. But I require that thou cut not off thy mercie from mine house for euer: no, not when the Lorde hath destroyed the enemies of Dauid, euery one from the earth.

16. So Ionathan made a bond with the house of Dauid, saying, Let the Lorde require it at the hands of Dauids enemies.

17. And againe Ionathan sware vnto Dauid, because he loued him (for he loued him as his owne soule)

18. Then said Ionathan to him, To morowe is the first day of the moneth: and thou shalt be looked for, for thy place shalbe emptie.

19. Therefore thou shalt hide thy selfe three dayes, then thou shalt goe downe quickely and come to the place where thou diddest hide thy selfe, when this matter was in hand, and shalt remayne by the stone Ezel.

20. And I will shoote three arrowes on the side thereof, as though I shot at a marke.

21. And after I wil sende a boy, saying, Goe, seeke the arrowes. If I say vnto the boy, See, the arrowes are on this side thee, bring them, & come thou: for it is well with thee and no hurt, as the Lord liueth.

22. But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee; go thy way: for the

24. So Dauid hid him selfe in the field: and when the first day of the moneth came, the King sate to eate meate.

25. And the King sate, as at other times vpon his seate, euen vpon his seate by the wall: and Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by Sauls side, but Dauids place was emptie.

32. And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be 

33. And Saul cast a speare at him to hit him, whereby Ionathan knew, that it was determined of his father to slay Dauid.

34. So Ionathan arose from the table in a great anger, and did eate no meate the seconde day of the moneth: for he was sorie for Dauid, and because his father had reuiled him.

35. And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field 

36. And he saide vnto his boy, Runne now, seeke the arrowes which I shoote, and as the boy ran, he shot an arrowe beyond him.

37. And when the boy was come to the place where the arrowe was that Ionathan had shot, Ionathan cryed after the boy, and sayde, Is not the arrowe beyond thee?

8. Then Saul called all the people together to warre, for to go downe to Keilah, & to besiege Dauid and his men.

9. And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, 

10. Then sayde Dauid, O Lord God of Israel, thy seruat hath heard, that Saul is about to come to Keilah to destroy the citie for my sake.

11. Wil the lordes of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hand? and will Saul come downe, as thy seruant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy seruant; the Lord sayde, He will come downe.

12. Then said Dauid, Will the lords of Keilah deliuer me vp, and the men that are with me, into the hand of Saul? And the Lord sayde, They will deliuer thee vp.

13. Then Dauid and his men, which were about sixe hundreth, arose, & departed out of Keilah, and went whither they coulde; it was tolde Saul, that Dauid was fled from Keilah, and he left off his iourney.

10. {\cf2 (24:11)} Behold, this day thine eyes haue seene, that the Lorde had deliuered thee this day into mine hand in the caue, and some bade me kill thee, but I had compassion on thee, and said, I will not lay mine hande on my master: for he is the Lordes Anoynted.

15. {\cf2 (24:16)} The Lord therfore be iudge, and iudge betweene thee and me, and see, & pleade my cause, and deliuer me out of thine hand.

16. And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, 

17. {\cf2 (24:18)} And sayd to Dauid, Thou art more righteous then I: for thou hast rendred me good, and I haue rendred thee euill.

12. So Dauids seruants turned their way, and went againe, and came, and tolde him all those things.

13. And Dauid said vnto his men, Girde euery man his sword about him. And they girded euery man his sworde: Dauid also girded his sworde; about foure hundreth men went vp after Dauid, and two hundreth abode by the cariage.

14. Nowe one of the seruantes tolde Abigail Nabals wife, saying, Beholde, Dauid sent messengers out of the wildernesse to salute our master, and he rayled on them.

15. But the men [were] very good 

16. They were as a wall vnto vs both by night & by day, all the while we were with them keeping sheepe.

17. Nowe therefore take heede, and see what thou shalt doe: for euill will surely come vpon our master, and vpon all his familie: for he is so wicked that a man can not speake to him.

18. Then Abigail made haste, & tooke two hundreth cakes, & two bottels of wine, & fiue sheepe ready dressed, & fiue measures of parched corne, and an hundreth frailes of raisins, & two hundreth of figs, and laded them on asses.

19. And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her 

20. And as shee rode on her asse, shee came downe by a secret place of the mountaine, and beholde, Dauid and his men came downe against her, and she met them.

21. And Dauid said, In deede I haue kept all in vaine that this fellow had in the wildernesse, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained vnto him: for he hath requited me euill for good.

22. So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that [pertain] to him by the morning light any that 

23. And when Abigail sawe Dauid, she hasted and lighted off her asse, and fell before Dauid on her face, and bowed her selfe to the ground,

24. And fel at his feete, and sayd, Oh, my lord, I haue committed the iniquitie, and I pray thee, let thine handmayde speake to thee, and heare thou the wordes of thine handmayde.

25. Let not my lorde, I pray thee, regard this wicked man Nabal: for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and follie is with him: but I thine handmayde sawe not the yong men of my lord whom thou sentest.

26. Now therefore, my lord, [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to [shed] blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own 

27. And now, this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought vnto my lorde, let it be giuen vnto the yong men, that followe my lord.

28. I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a 

29. Yet 

30. And when the Lorde shall haue done to my lord al the good that he hath promised thee, and shall haue made thee ruler ouer Israel,

31. That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath 

32. Then Dauid said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meete me.

33. And blessed [be] thy advice, and blessed [be] thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to [shed] blood, 

34. For in very deed, [as] the LORD God of Israel liveth, 

35. Then Dauid receiued of her hande that which she had brought him, and said to her, Goe vp in peace to thine house: beholde, I haue heard thy voyce, and haue graunted thy petition.

36. And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart [was] merry within him, for he [was] very drunken: wherefore she told him 

37. But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became [as] 

38. And about ten dayes after, the Lord smote Nabal, that he dyed.

39. And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed [be] the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to 

40. And whe the seruants of Dauid were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake vnto her, saying, Dauid sent vs to thee, to take thee to his wife.

41. And she arose, and bowed her selfe on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmayde be a seruant to wash the feete of the seruants of my lord.

42. And Abigail hasted, & arose, and rode vpon an asse, and her fiue maides folowed her, and she went after the messengers of Dauid, and was his wife.

43. Dauid also tooke Ahinoam of Izreel, and they were both his wiues.

44. Now Saul had giuen Michal his daughter Dauids wife to Phalti the sonne of Laish, which was of Gallim.

## 1 Samuel 26

1. Againe the Ziphims came vnto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doeth not Dauid hide him selfe in the hill of Hachilah before Ieshimon?

2. Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand 

3. And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Ieshimon by the way side. Now Dauid abode in the wildernesse, and he sawe that Saul came after him into the wildernesse.

4. (For Dauid had sent out spies, and vnderstood, that Saul was come in very deede)

5. Then Dauid arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched, and when Dauid beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the sonne of Ner which was his chiefe captaine, (for Saul lay in the fort, and the people pitched round about him)

6. Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the 

7. So Dauid and Abishai came downe to the people by night: and beholde, Saul lay sleeping within the fort, and his speare did sticke in the ground at his head: and Abner and the people lay round about him.

8. Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not [smite] him the 

9. And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand 

10. Moreouer Dauid said, As the Lord liueth, eyther the Lorde shall smite him, or his day shall come to dye, or he shall descend into battel, and perish.

11. The Lorde keepe mee from laying mine hand vpon the Lordes anointed: but, I pray thee, take now the speare that is at his head, and the pot of water, and let vs goe hence.

12. So Dauid tooke the speare and the pot of water from Sauls head, and they gate them away, and no man saw it, nor marked it, neither did any awake, but they were all asleepe: for the Lorde had sent a dead sleepe vpon them.

13. Then Dauid went vnto the other side, and stoode on the toppe of an hill a farre off, a great space being betweene them.

14. And Dauid cryed to the people, and to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying, Hearest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered, & said, Who art thou that cryest to the King?

15. And David said to Abner, [Art] not thou a [valiant] 

16. This is not well done of thee: as the Lord liueth, ye are worthy to dye, because ye haue not kept your master the Lordes Anointed: and now see where the Kings speare is, and the pot of water that was at his head.

17. And Saul knew David's voice, and said, [Is] this thy voice, 

18. And he sayde, Wherefore doeth my lorde thus persecute his seruant? for what haue I done? or what euill is in mine hand?

19. Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him 

20. Nowe therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lorde: for the King of Israel is come out to seeke a flea, as one would hunt a partridge in the mountaines.

21. Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was 

22. Then Dauid answered, and saide, Beholde the Kings speare, let one of the yong men come ouer and set it.

23. The LORD render to every man his 

24. And beholde, like as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes: so let my life be set by in the eyes of the Lord, that he may deliuer me out of all tribulation.

25. Then Saul said to David, Blessed [be] thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great [things], and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his

2. Dauid therefore arose, and he, and the sixe hundreth men that were with him, went vnto Achish the sonne of Maoch King of Gath.

3. And David 

4. And it was tolde Saul that Dauid was fled to Gath: so he sought no more for him.

5. And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, 

6. Then Achish gaue him Ziklag that same day: therefore Ziklag pertaineth vnto the kings of Iudah vnto this day.

7. And the time that Dauid dwelt in the countrey of the Philistims, was foure moneths and certaine dayes.

8. And David and his men went up, and invaded the 

9. And Dauid smote the lande, and left neither man nor woman aliue, and tooke sheepe, & oxen, and asses, and camels, and apparell, and returned and came to Achish.

10. And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the 

11. And Dauid saued neither man nor woman aliue, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tel on vs, and say, So did Dauid, and so will be his maner all the while that he dwelleth in the countrey of the Philistims.

12. And Achish beleeued Dauid, saying, He hath made his people of Israel vtterly to abhorre him: therefore he shalbe my seruant for euer.

## 1 Samuel 28

1. And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, 

2. And Dauid said to Achish, Surely thou shalt knowe, what thy seruant can doe; Achish sayde to Dauid, Surely I will make thee keeper of mine head for euer.

3. Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had 

4. Then the Philistims assembled themselues, and came, and pitched in Shunem: and Saul assembled all Israel, and they pitched in Gilboa.

5. And when Saul saw the hoste of the Philistims, he was afraid, & his heart was sore astonied.

6. And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by 

7. Then saide Saul vnto his seruants, Seeke me a woman that hath a familiar spirite, that I may goe to her, and aske of her; his seruants said to him, Beholde, there is a woman at En-dor that hath a familiar spirit.

8. And Saul 

9. And the woman saide vnto him, Beholde, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath destroyed the sorcerers, and the southsayers out of the land: wherefore then seekest thou to take me in a snare to cause me to die?

10. And Saul sware to her by the Lorde, saying, As the Lord liueth, no harme shall come to thee for this thing.

11. Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up 

12. And when the woman sawe Samuel, she cryed with a loude voyce, and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceiued me? for thou art Saul.

13. And the King said vnto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said vnto Saul, I saw gods ascending vp out of the earth.

14. And he said unto her, What form [is] he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he [is] covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it [was] 

15. And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me vp? Then Saul answered, I am in great distresse: for the Philistims make warre against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by Prophetes, neither by dreames: therefore I haue called thee, that thou mayest tell me, what I shall doe.

16. Then said Samuel, Wherefore then doest thou aske of me, seeing the Lord is gone from thee, and is thine enemie?

17. And the LORD hath done to 

18. Because thou obeyedst not the voyce of the Lorde, nor executedst his fierce wrath vpon the Amalekites, therefore hath the Lorde done this vnto thee this day.

19. Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: 

20. Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore 

21. And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I 

22. Now therefore, I pray thee, hearke thou also vnto ye voyce of thine handmaid, & let me set a morsell of bread before thee, that thou mayest eat and get thee strength, and go on thy iourney.

23. But he refused, and said, I will not eate: but his seruants and the woman together compelled him, and he obeyed their voyce: so he arose from the earth, and sate on the bed.

24. And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded [it], and did bake 

25. Then she brought them before Saul, and before his seruants: and when they had eaten, they stoode, and went away the same night.

## 1 Samuel 29

1. So the Philistims were gathered together with all their armies in Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by the fountaine, which is in Izreel.

2. And the lords of the Philistines passed on by 

3. Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do] these Hebrews [here]? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, [Is] not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, 

4. And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? [should it] not [be] with the 

5. Is not this Dauid, of whome they sang in daunces, saying, Saul slewe his thousande, and Dauid his ten thousande?

6. Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, [as] the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy 

7. Wherefore nowe returne, and go in peace, that thou displease not the princes of the Philistims.

8. And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may 

9. Achish then answered, and said to Dauid, I knowe thou pleasest mee, as an Angell of God: but the princes of the Philistims haue saide, Let him not goe vp with vs to battell.

10. Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy 

11. So Dauid and his men rose vp earely to depart in the morning, and to returne into the lande of the Philistims: and the Philistims went vp to Izreel.

## 1 Samuel 30

1. And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on 

2. And had taken the women that were therein, prisoners, both small and great, and slewe not a man, but caryed them away, & went their wayes.

3. So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, [it was] burned with fire; and their 

4. Then Dauid and the people that was with him, lift vp their voyces and wept, vntill they could weepe no more.

5. Dauids two wiues were taken prisoners also, Ahinoam the Izreelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

6. And David was greatly distressed; for the people 

7. And Dauid saide to Abiathar the Priest Ahimelechs sonne, I pray thee, bring me the Ephod; Abiathar brought the Ephod to Dauid.

8. And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake [them], and without fail 

9. So Dauid and the sixe hundreth men that were with him, went, and came to the riuer Besor, where a part of them abode:

10. But Dauid and foure hundreth men followed (for two hundreth abode behinde, being too wearie to goe ouer the riuer Besor)

11. And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him 

12. Also they gaue him a fewe figges, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirite came againe to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunke any water in three dayes, and three nightes.

13. And Dauid saide vnto him, To whome belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he saide, I am a yong man of Egypt, and seruant to an Amalekite: and my master left me three dayes agoe, because I fell sicke.

14. We roued vpon the South of Chereth, & vpon the coast belonging to Iudah, and vpon the South of Caleb, and we burnt Ziklag with fire.

15. And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, 

16. And when he had brought him down, behold, [they were] spread abroad upon all the earth, 

17. And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening 

18. And Dauid recouered all that the Amalekites had taken: also Dauid rescued his two wiues.

19. And they lacked nothing, small or great, sonne or daughter, or of the spoyle of all that they had taken away: Dauid recouered them all.

20. And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drave before those [other] cattle, and said, This [is] David's 

21. And Dauid came to the two hundreth men that were too wearie for to followe Dauid: whome they had made also to abide at the riuer Besor: and they came to meete Dauid, and to meete the people that were with him: so when Dauid came neere to the people, hee saluted them.

22. Then answered all the wicked men and [men] of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them [ought] of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his 

23. Then saide Dauid, Yee shall not doe so, my brethren, with that which the Lorde hath giuen vs, who hath preserued vs, and deliuered the companie that came against vs, into our handes.

24. For who will obey you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth downe to the battel, so shall his part be, that tarieth by the stuffe: they shal part alike.

25. 
          

26. When Dauid therefore came to Ziklag, he sent of the pray vnto the Elders of Iudah and to his friends, saying, See there is a blessing for you of the spoyle of the enemies of the Lord.

27. Hee sent to them of Beth-el, and to them of South Ramoth, and to them of Iattir,

28. And to them of Aroer, and to them of Siphmoth, and to them of Eshtemoa,

29. And to them of Rachal, and to them of the cities of the Ierahmeelites, and to them of the cities of the Kenites,

2. And the Philistims preassed sore vpon Saul and his sonnes, and slewe Ionathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua Sauls sonnes.

3. And when the battel went sore against Saul, the archers and bowmen hit him, and hee was sore wounded of the archers.

4. Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, 

5. And when his armour bearer sawe that Saul was dead, he fell likewise vpon his sword, & dyed with him.

6. So Saul dyed, and his three sonnes, and his armour bearer, and all his men that same day together.
