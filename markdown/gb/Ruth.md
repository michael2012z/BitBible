## Ruth 1

1. Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the 

2. And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi: and the names of his two sonnes, Mahlon, and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem Iudah: and when they came into the land of Moab, they continued there.

3. Then Elimelech the husbande of Naomi died, and she remayned with her two sonnes,

4. And they took them wives of the 

5. And Mahlon and Chilion dyed also both twaine: so the woman was left destitute of her two sonnes, and of her husband.

6. Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had 

7. Wherefore shee departed out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her, and they went on their way to returne vnto the land of Iudah.

8. Then Naomi saide vnto her two daughters in lawe, Goe, returne eche of you vnto her owne mothers house: the Lord shew fauour vnto you, as ye haue done with the dead, and with me.

9. The LORD grant you that ye may find 

10. And they saide vnto her, Surely we will returne with thee vnto thy people.

11. But Naomi saide, Turne againe, my daughters: for what cause will you go with me? are there any mo sonnes in my wombe, that they may bee your husbands?

12. Turne againe, my daughters: go your way: for I am too olde to haue an husband. If I should say, I haue hope, and if I had an husbad this night: yea, if I had borne sonnes,

13. Would yee tarie for them, till they were of age? would ye be deferred for them from taking of husbands? nay my daughters: for it grieueth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lorde is gone out against me.

14. And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah 

15. And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: 

16. And Ruth answered, Intreate mee not to leaue thee, nor to depart from thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe: and where thou dwellest, I will dwell: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.

17. Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. the Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death depart thee and me.

18. Whe she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking vnto her.

19. So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was 

20. And she answered them, Call me not Naomi, but call me Mara: for the Almightie hath giuen me much bitternes.

21. I went out full, and the Lorde hath caused me to returne emptie: why call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath humbled me, and the Almightie hath brought me vnto aduersitie?

22. So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of 

## Ruth 2

1. And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of 

2. And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and 

3. And she went, and came and gleaned in the fielde after the reapers, and it came to passe, that she met with the portion of the fielde of Boaz, who was of the familie of Elimelech.

4. And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and saide vnto the reapers, The Lord be with you: and they answered him, The Lord blesse thee.

5. Then saide Boaz vnto his seruant that was appointed ouer the reapers, Whose maide is this?

6. And the seruant that was appointed ouer the reapers, answered, and said, It is the Moabitish maide, that came with Naomi out of the countrey of Moab:

7. And shee saide vnto vs, I pray you, let mee gleane and gather after the reapers among the sheaues: so shee came, and hath continued from that time in the morning vnto now, saue that she taried a litle in the house.

8. Then said Boaz vnto Ruth, Hearest thou, my daughter? goe to none other fielde to gather, neither goe from hence: but abide here by my maydens.

9. 
          

10. Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] a 

11. And Boaz answered, & said vnto her, All is told and shewed me that thou hast done vnto thy mother in lawe, since the death of thine husband, and how thou hast left thy father & thy mother, and ye land where thou wast borne, & art come vnto a people which thou knewest not in time past.

12. The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose 

13. Then she saide, Let me finde fauour in thy sight, my lord: for thou hast comforted mee, and spoken comfortably vnto thy mayde, though I be not like to one of thy maydes.

14. And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [corn], and she did eat, and was sufficed, and 

15. And when she arose to gleane, Boaz commanded his seruants, saying, Let her gather among the sheaues, and doe not rebuke her.

16. Also let fall some of the sheaues for her, and let it lie, that she may gather it vp, & rebuke her not.

17. So she gleaned in the fielde vntill euening, and she thresshed that shee had gathered, and it was about an Ephah of barly.

18. And she took [it] up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she 

19. Then her mother in lawe saide vnto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he, that knewe thee; she shewed her mother in lawe, with whome she had wrought, and saide, The mans name, with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz.

20. And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed [be] he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the 

21. And Ruth the Moabitesse said, He said also certainely vnto mee, Thou shalt be with my seruants, vntill they haue ended all mine haruest.

22. And Naomi answered vnto Ruth her daughter in lawe, It is best, my daughter, that thou goe out with his maides, that they meete thee not in an other fielde.

23. Then she kept her by the maides of Boaz, to gather vnto the end of barly haruest, and of wheate haruest, and dwelt with her mother in lawe.

## Ruth 3

1. Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek 

2. Now also is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maides thou wast? beholde, he winoweth barly to night in the floore.

3. Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: [but] make not thyself known unto the 

4. And when he shall sleepe, marke the place where he layeth him downe, and go, and vncouer the place of his feete, and lay thee downe, and he shall tell thee what thou shalt doe.

5. And she answered her, All that thou biddest me, I will doe.

6. So she went downe vnto the floore, and did according to all that her mother in lawe bade her.

7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his 

8. And at midnight the man was afraide and caught holde: and loe, a woman lay at his feete.

9. Then he sayd, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmayd: spread therefore the wing of thy garment ouer thine handmayd: for thou art the kinsman.

10. And he said, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD, my daughter: [for] thou hast 

11. And now, my daughter, feare not: I will doe to thee all that thou requirest: for all the citie of my people doeth knowe, that thou art a vertuous woman.

12. And now, it is true that I am thy kinsman, howbeit there is a kinsman neerer then I.

13. Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, [that] if he 

14. And she lay at his feete vntill the morning: and she arose before one could know another: for he sayd, Let no man knowe, that a woman came into the floore.

15. Also he sayd, Bring the sheete that thou hast vpon thee, and holde it; when she helde it, he measured sixe measures of barly, and layde them on her, and she went into the citie.

16. And when she came to her mother in law, she said, 

17. And said, These sixe measures of barly gaue he me: for he sayd to me, Thou shalt not come emptie vnto thy mother in lawe.

18. Then sayd she, My daughter, sit still, vntill thou knowe how the thing will fall: for the man wil not be in rest, vntill he hath finished the matter this same day.

## Ruth 4

1. Then went Boaz up to the 

2. Then he tooke ten men of the Elders of the citie, and sayd, Sit ye downe here; they sate downe.

3. And he said vnto ye kinsman, Naomi, that is come againe out of ye countrey of Moab, wil sell a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelechs.

4. And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy [it] before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem [it]: but if thou wilt not redeem [it, then] tell me, that I may know: for [there is] none to redeem [it] 

5. Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his 

6. And the kinsman answered, I can not redeeme it, lest I destroy mine owne inheritance: redeeme my right to thee, for I can not redeeme it.

7. Now this [was the manner] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbour: and this [was] a 

8. Therefore the kinsman sayd to Boas, Buy it for thee: and he drew off his shooe.

9. And Boaz sayd vnto the Elders & vnto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi.

10. Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his 

11. And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in 

12. And that thine house be like the house of Pharez ( whom Thamar bare vnto Iudah) of the seede which the Lord shall giue thee of this yong woman.

13. So Boaz tooke Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in vnto her, the Lorde gaue that she conceiued, and bare a sonne.

14. And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that 

15. And he shall be unto thee a restorer of [thy] life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than 

16. And Naomi tooke the childe, and layde it in her lap, and became nource vnto it.

17. And the women her neighbours gaue it a name, saying, There is a childe borne to Naomi, and called the name thereof Obed: the same was the father of Ishai, the father of Dauid.

18. Now these [are] the generations of 

19. And Hezron begate Ram, & Ram begate Amminadab,

20. And Amminadab begate Nahshon, and Nahshon begate Salmah,

21. And Salmon begate Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

22. And Obed begate Ishai, and Ishai begate Dauid.
