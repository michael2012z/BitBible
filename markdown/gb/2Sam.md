## 2 Samuel 1

1. Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 

2. It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with 

3. Then Dauid saide vnto him, Whence commest thou? And he said vnto him, Out of the host of Israel I am escaped.

4. And Dauid saide vnto him, What is done? I pray thee, tell me. Then he said, that the people is fled from the battel, and many of the people are ouerthrowen, and dead, & also Saul and Ionathan his sonne are dead.

5. And Dauid saide vnto the yong man that tolde it him, Howe knowest thou that Saul and Ionathan his sonne be dead?

6. And the young man that told him said, 

7. And when he looked backe, he saw me, and called me; I answered, Here am I.

8. And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an

10. So I came vpon him, and slewe him, and because I was sure that hee coulde not liue, after that hee had fallen, I tooke the crowne that was vpon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arme, and brought them hither vnto my lord.

11. Then Dauid tooke hold on his clothes, & rent them, and likewise al the men that were with him.

12. And they mourned and wept, and fasted vntil euen, for Saul and for Ionathan his sonne, & for the people of the Lorde, and for the house of Israel, because they were slaine with the sword.

13. 
          

14. And Dauid said vnto him, How wast thou not afrayd, to put forth thine hand to destroy the Anoynted of the Lord?

15. Then Dauid called one of his yong men, and said, Goe neere, and fall vpon him; hee smote him that he dyed.

16. And David said unto him, 

17. Then Dauid mourned with this lamentation ouer Saul, and ouer Ionathan his sonne,

18. (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah 

19. The beauty of Israel is 

20. Tell it not in Gath, nor publish it in the streetes of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistims reioyce, lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph.

21. Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you, nor

23. Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not 

24. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, 

25. Howe were the mightie slaine in the mids of the battel! O Ionathan, thou wast slaine in thine hie places.

26. I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of

## 2 Samuel 2

1. And it came to pass after this, that David

3. And his men that [were] with 

4. Then the men of Iudah came, and there they anoynted Dauid King ouer the house of Iudah; they tolde Dauid, saying, that the men of Iabesh Gilead buried Saul.

5. And Dauid sent messengers vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead, and said vnto them, Blessed are ye of the Lord, that yee haue shewed such kindenes vnto your lord Saul, that you haue buried him.

6. And now the LORD shew kindness and

8. But Abner the sonne of Ner that was captaine of Sauls hoste, tooke Ish-bosheth the sonne of Saul, and brought him to Mahanaim,

9. And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over 

10. Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne was fourtie yeere olde wen he began to reigne ouer Israel, and reigned two yeere: but the house of Iudah followed Dauid.

11. And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six 

12. And Abner the sonne of Ner, and the seruantes of Ish-bosheth the sonne of Saul went out of Mahanaim to Gibeon.

13. And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and the seruants of Dauid went out and met one another by the poole of Gibeon: and they sate downe, the one on the one side of the poole, and the other on the otherside of the poole.

14. And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and 

15. Then there arose and went ouer twelue of Beniamin by number, which perteined to Ish-bosheth the sonne of Saul, and twelue of the seruants of Dauid.

16. And they caught every one his 

17. And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, 

18. And there were three sonnes of Zeruiah there, Ioab, and Abishai, and Asahel; Asahel was as light on foote as a wilde roe.

19. And Asahel followed after Abner, and in going he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from Abner.

20. Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, Yea.

21. Then Abner said, Turne thee either to the right hande, or to the left, and take one of the yong men, and take thee his weapons: and Asahel would not depart from him.

22. And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: 

23. Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the

25. And the children of Beniamin gathered them selues together after Abner, and were on an heape and stoode on the top of an hill.

26. Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the

29. And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plaine, and went ouer Iorden, and past through all Bithron till they came to Mahanaim.

30. Ioab also returned backe from Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Dauids seruants nineteene men and Asahel.

31. But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three

## 2 Samuel 3

1. Now there was 

2. And vnto Dauid were children borne in Hebron: and his eldest sonne was Amnon of Ahinoam the Izreelite,

3. And his second, 

4. And the fourth, Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith, and the fifth, Shephatiah the sonne of Abital,

5. And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in 

6. Nowe while there was warre betweene the house of Saul and the house of Dauid, Abner made all his power for the house of Saul.

7. And Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiiah; Ish-bosheth sayde to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in to my fathers concubine?

8. Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, [Am] I a 

9. 
          

10. To remoue the kingdome from the house of Saul, that the throne of Dauid may be stablished ouer Israel, and ouer Iudah, euen from Dan to Beer-sheba.

11. And he durst no more answere to Abner: for he feared him.

12. Then Abner sent messengers to Dauid on his behalfe, saying, Whose is the lande? who should also say, Make couenant with me, and beholde, mine hande shalbe with thee, to bring all Israel vnto thee.

13. Who saide, Well, I will make a couenant with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, that thou see not my face except thou bring Michal Sauls daughter when thou commest to see me.

14. Then Dauid sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne, saying, Deliuer me my wife Michal, which I marryed for an hundreth foreskinnes of the Philistims.

15. And Ish-bosheth sent, and tooke her from her husband Phaltiel the sonne of Laish.

16. And her husband went with her, & came weeping behinde her, vnto Bahurim: then saide Abner vnto him, Go, and returne. So he returned.

17. And Abner had 

18. Nowe then doe it: for the Lord hath spoken of Dauid, saying, By the hand of my seruant Dauid I will saue my people Israel out of the handes of the Philistims, and out of the handes of all their enemies.

19. And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole 

20. So Abner came to Dauid to Hebron, hauing twentie men with him, and Dauid made a feast vnto Abner, and to the men that were with him.

21. Then Abner sayde vnto Dauid, I will rise vp, and goe gather all Israel vnto my lorde the King, that they may make a couenant with thee, and that thou mayest reigne ouer all that thine heart desireth. Then Dauid let Abner depart, who went in peace.

22. And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came 

23. When Ioab, & all the hoste that was with him were come, men tolde Ioab, saying, Abner the sonne of Ner came to the King, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

24. Then Joab came to the king, and said, 

25. Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner: for he came to deceiue thee, and to knowe thy outgoing and ingoing, and to knowe all that thou doest.

26. And when Ioab was gone out from Dauid, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him againe from the well of Siriah vnknowing to Dauid.

27. And when Abner was come againe to Hebron, Ioab tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him peaceably, and smote him vnder the fift ryb, that he dyed, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

28. And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are] 

29. Let the blood fall on the head of Ioab, and on all his fathers house, that the house of Ioab be neuer without some that haue running issues, or leper, or that leaneth on a staffe, or that doeth fall on the sworde, or that lacketh bread.

30. So Joab and 

31. And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn 

32. And when they had buryed Abner in Hebron, the King lift vp his voyce, and wept beside the sepulchre of Abner, and all the people wept.

33. And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner 

34. Thine handes were not bounde, nor thy feete tyed in fetters of brasse: but as a man falleth before wicked men, so diddest thou fall; all the people wept againe for him.

35. And when all the people came to cause David to eat 

36. And all the people took notice [of it], and it 

37. For all the people and all Israel vnderstoode that day, howe that it was not the Kings deede that Abner the sonne of Ner was slaine.

38. And the King said vnto his seruants, Know ye not, that there is a prince & a great man falle this day in Israel?

39. And I am this day weake and newly anoynted King: and these men the sonnes of Zeruiah be too harde for me: the Lorde rewarde the doer of euill according to his wickednesse.

5. And the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah went and came in the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth (who slept on a bed at noone)

6. And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as though] they 

7. For when they came into the house, he slept on his bed in his bed chamber, & they smote him, and slewe him, and beheaded him, and tooke his head, and gate them away through the plaine all the night.

8. And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth vnto Dauid to Hebron, and saide to the King, Beholde the head of Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne thine enemie, who sought after thy life: and the Lorde hath auenged my lorde the King this day of Saul, and of his seede.

9. Then Dauid answered Rechab & Baanah his brother, the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, and saide vnto them, As the Lorde liueth, who hath deliuered my soule out of al aduersity,

10. When one tolde me, and sayde that Saul was dead, (thinking to haue brought good tydings) I tooke him and slewe him in Ziklag, who thought that I woulde haue giuen him a rewarde for his tidings:

11. How 

12. Then Dauid commanded his yong men, & they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feete, and hanged them vp ouer the poole in Hebron: but they tooke the head of Ish-bosheth, & buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 5

1. Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we [are] thy 

2. And in time past when Saul was our King, thou leddest Israel in and out: and the Lord hath sayde to thee, Thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captaine ouer Israel.

3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron 

4. Dauid was thirtie yeere olde when he began to reigne: and hee reigned fortie yeere.

5. In Hebron hee reigned ouer Iudah seuen yeere, and sixe moneths: and in Ierusalem hee reigned thirtie and three yeeres ouer all Israel and Iudah.

6. And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the

8. And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated of David's soul, [he shall be chief and captain]. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not 

9. So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from 

10. And Dauid prospered and grewe: for the Lord God of hostes was with him.

11. Hiram also king of Tyrus sent messengers to Dauid, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walles: and they built Dauid an house.

12. Then Dauid knewe that the Lorde had stablished him King ouer Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdome for his people Israels sake.

13. And Dauid tooke him mo concubines & wiues out of Ierusalem, after hee was come from Hebron, & mo sonnes and daughters were borne to Dauid.

14. And these bee the names of the sonnes that were borne vnto him in Ierusale: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Salomon,

15. And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Iaphia,

16. And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

17. But when the Philistims hearde that they had anoynted Dauid King ouer Israel, all the Philistims came vp to seeke Dauid: and when Dauid heard, he went downe to a fort.

18. But the Philistims came, and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim.

19. And David 

20. Then Dauid came to Baal-perazim, & smote them there, and sayde, The Lorde hath deuided mine enemies asunder before mee, as waters be deuided asunder: therefore he called the name of that place, Baal-perazim.

21. And there they left their images, and Dauid and his men burnt them.

22. And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of 

23. And when Dauid asked counsell of the Lorde, hee answered, Thou shalt not goe vp, but turne about behinde them, and come vpon them ouer against the mulberie trees.

24. And when thou hearest the noyse of one going in the toppes of the mulberie trees, then remoue: for then shall the Lord goe out before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistims.

5. And David and all the house of Israel 

6. And when they came to Nachons threshing floore, Vzzah put his hande to the Arke of God, and helde it: for the oxen did shake it.

7. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God 

8. And Dauid was displeased, because the Lord had smitten Vzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez Vzzah vntill this day.

9. Therefore Dauid that day feared the Lord, and sayd, How shall the Arke of the Lorde come to mee?

10. So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom 

11. And the Arke of the Lorde continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, three moneths, and the Lorde blessed Obed-edom, and all his houshold.

12. And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that [pertaineth] unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and 

13. And when they that bare the Arke of the Lord had gone sixe paces, he offred an oxe, and a fatte beast.

14. And David danced before the LORD with all [his] might; and David [was] girded with a linen 

15. So Dauid & all the house of Israel, brought the Arke of the Lord with shouting, and sound of trumpet.

16. And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she 

17. And when they had brought in the Arke of the Lord, they set it in his place, in the mids of the tabernacle that Dauid had pitched for it: then Dauid offred burnt offrings, and peace offrings before the Lord.

18. And assoone as Dauid had made an ende of offring burnt offrings and peace offrings, hee blessed the people in the Name of the Lorde of hostes,

19. And gaue among all the people, euen among the whole multitude of Israel, aswel to the women as men, to euerie one a cake of bread, and a piece of flesh, and a bottell of wine: so all the people departed euerie one to his house.

3. Then Nathan sayde vnto the King, Go, and doe all that is in thine heart: for the Lord is with thee.

4. And the same night the worde of the Lorde came vnto Nathan, saying,

5. Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD,

10. And the rest of the people hee deliuered into the hande of Abishai his brother, that hee might put them in aray against the children of Ammon.

11. And he sayde, If the Aramites be stronger then I, thou shalt helpe me, and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will come and succour thee.

12. Be of good courage, and let us play the men for

14. And when the children of Ammon sawe that the Aramites fled, they fled also before Abishai, & entred into the citie. so Ioab returned fro the children of Ammon, and came to Ierusalem.

15. And when the Aramites sawe that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered them together.

16. And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Aramites that were beyond the Riuer: and they came to Helam, and Shobach the captaine of the hoste of Hadarezer went before them.

17. And when it was told David, he gathered 

18. And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew [the men of]

5. And the woman conceived, and sent and 

6. Then Dauid sent to Ioab, saying, Send me Vriah the Hittite; Ioab sent Vriah to Dauid.

7. And when Vriah came vnto him, Dauid demanded him how Ioab did, and howe the people fared, and how the warre prospered.

8. And David said to Uriah, 

9. But Vriah slept at the doore of the Kings palace with all the seruants of his lord, and went not downe to his house.

10. Then they tolde Dauid, saying, Vriah went not downe to his house: and Dauid saide vnto Vriah, Commest thou not from thy iourney? why didst thou not go downe to thine house?

11. And Uriah said unto David, 

12. Then Dauid sayd vnto Vriah, Tary yet this day, & to morow I will send thee away. So Vriah abode in Ierusalem that day, and the morowe.

13. And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him 

14. And on the morowe Dauid wrote a letter to Ioab, and sent it by the hand of Vriah.

15. And he wrote in the letter, saying, 

16. So when Ioab besieged the citie, he assigned Vriah vnto a place, where he knewe that strong men were.

17. And the men of the citie came out, and fought with Ioab: and there fell of the people of the seruants of Dauid, and Vriah the Hittite also dyed.

18. Then Ioab sent and tolde Dauid all the things concerning the warre,

19. And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an ende of telling all the matters of the warre vnto the King,

20. And if the kings anger arise, so that he say vnto thee, Wherefore approched ye vnto the citie to fight? knewe ye not that they would hurle from the wall?

21. Who smote Abimelech the son of 

22. So the messenger went, and came & shewed Dauid all that Ioab had sent him for.

23. And the messenger said vnto Dauid, Certainely the men preuailed against vs, and came out vnto vs into the field, but we pursued them vnto the entring of the gate.

24. But the shooters shot from ye wall against thy seruants, and some of the Kings seruants be dead: & thy seruant Vriah the Hittite is also dead.

25. Then David said unto the messenger, 

26. And when the wife of Vriah heard that her husband Vriah was dead, she mourned for her husband.

27. So when the mourning was past, Dauid sent and tooke her into his house, and shee became his wife, and bare him a sonne: but ye thing that Dauid had done, displeased the Lord.

## 2 Samuel 12

1. And the LORD sent 

2. The rich man had exceeding many sheepe and oxen:

3. But the poore had none at all, saue one litle sheepe which he had bought, and nourished vp: and it grew vp with him, and with his children also, and did eate of his owne morsels, and dranke of his owne cup, and slept in his bosome, and was vnto him as his daughter.

4. Now there came a stranger vnto the rich man, who refused to take of his owne sheepe, and of his owne oxen to dresse for the stranger that was come vnto him, but tooke the poore mans sheepe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

5. Then Dauid was exceeding wroth with the man, and sayde to Nathan, As the Lorde liueth, the man that hath done this thing, shall surely dye,

6. And he shall restore the lambe foure folde, because he did this thing, and had no pitie thereof.

7. Then Nathan sayd to Dauid, Thou art the man. Thus sayth the Lord God of Israel, I anoynted thee King ouer Israel, and deliuered thee out of the hand of Saul,

8. And I gave thee thy master's 

9. Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife [to be] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the 

10. Now therefore the sworde shall neuer depart from thine house, because thou hast despised me, and taken the wife of Vriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

11. Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give [them] unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this 

12. For thou diddest it secretly: but I will doe this thing before all Israel, and before the sunne.

13. And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath 

14. Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to 

15. So Nathan departed vnto his house: and the Lord stroke the childe that Vriahs wife bare vnto Dauid, and it was sicke.

16. David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and 

17. And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat 

18. So on the seuenth day the child dyed: and the seruants of Dauid feared to tell him that the childe was dead: for they sayde, Beholde, while the childe was aliue, we spake vnto him, and he woulde not hearken vnto our voyce: how then shall we say vnto him, The childe is dead, to vexe him more?

19. But when Dauid sawe that his seruantes whispered, Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead: therefore Dauid sayde vnto his seruants, Is the childe dead? And they sayd, He is dead.

20. Then David 

21. Then 

22. And he sayde, While the childe was yet aliue, I fasted, and wept: for I sayde, Who can tell whether God will haue mercy on me, that the childe may liue?

23. But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? 

24. And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and 

25. And he sent by the hand of Nathan the

27. And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of 

28. Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, & besiege the city, that thou mayest take it, lest the victorie be attributed to me.

29. So Dauid gathered al the people together, and went against Rabbah, and besieged it, and tooke it.

1. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name [was]

3. But Amnon had a friend called Ionadab, the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother: and Ionadab was a very subtile man.

4. Who sayde vnto him, Why art thou the Kings sonne so leane from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? Then Amnon answered him, I loue Tamar my brother Absaloms sister.

5. And Jonadab said unto him, 

6. So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of 

7. Then Dauid sent home to Tamar, saying, Goe now to thy brother Amnons house, and dresse him meate.

8. So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house, and he lay downe: and she tooke floure, and knead it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.

9. And she took a pan, and 

10. Then Amnon said vnto Tamar, Bring the meate into the chamber, that I may eate of thine hand; Tamar tooke the cakes which shee had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

11. And when she had set them before him to eate, he tooke her, and sayd vnto her, Come, lye with me, my sister.

12. But shee answered him, Nay, my brother, doe not force me: for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: commit not this follie.

13. And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of 

14. Howbeit he would not hearken vnto her voyce, but being stronger then she, forced her, and lay with her.

15. Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater then the loue, wherewith hee had loued her: and Amnon sayde vnto her, Vp, get thee hence.

16. And she answered him, There is no cause: this euill (to put mee away) is greater then the other that thou diddest vnto me: but he would not heare her,

17. But called his seruant that serued him, & sayd, Put this woman now out from me, & locke the doore after her.

18. And [she had] a garment of 

19. And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent the garment of diuers colours which was on her, and layde her hand on her head, and went her way crying.

20. And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but 

21. But when King Dauid heard all these things, he was very wroth.

22. And Absalom sayde vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

23. And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and 

24. And Absalom came to the King and sayd, Beholde now, thy seruant hath sheepesherers: I pray thee, that the King with his seruants would goe with thy seruant.

25. But the King answered Absalom, Nay my sonne, I pray thee, let vs not goe all, lest we be chargeable vnto thee. Yet Absalom lay sore vpon him: howbeit he would not go, but thaked him.

26. Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother 

27. But Absalom was instant vpon him, & he sent Amnon with him, & all the Kings children.

28. Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not 

29. And the seruantes of Absalom did vnto Amnon, as Absalom had commanded: and al the Kings sonnes arose, and euery man gate him vp vpon his mule, and fled.

30. And while they were in the way, tydings came to Dauid, saying, Absalom hath slaine al the Kings sonnes, & there is not one of them left.

31. Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the 

32. And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother answered and sayde, Let not my lord suppose that they haue slayne all the yong men the Kings sonnes: for Amnon onely is dead, because Absalom had reported so, since hee forced his sister Tamar.

33. Nowe therefore let not my lord the King take the thing so grieuously, to thinke that all ye Kings sonnes are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

34. Then Absalom fled: and the yong man that kept the watch, lift vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behinde him.

35. And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, 

36. And assoone as hee had left speaking, behold, the Kings sonnes came, & lift vp their voyces, and wept: and the King also and all his seruants wept exceedingly sore.

37. But Absalom fled, and went to

3. And come to the King, and speake on this maner vnto him, (for Ioab taught her what she should say).

4. Then the woman of Tekoah spake vnto the king, & fel downe on her face to the ground, and did obeysance, and sayd, Helpe, O King.

5. Then the King sayd vnto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am in deede a widow, and mine husband is dead:

9. And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the

11. Then said she, I pray thee, let the king

23. And Ioab arose, and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Ierusalem.

24. And the king said, Let him

26. And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred 

27. And Absalom had three sonnes, and one daughter named Tamar, which was a fayre woman to looke vpon.

28. So Absalom dwelt the space of two yeres in Ierusalem, and saw not the Kings face.

29. Therefore Absalom sent for Ioab to sende him to the King, but he would not come to him: and when he sent againe, he would not come.

30. Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it 

31. Then Ioab arose, & came to Absalom vnto his house, & sayd vnto him, Wherefore haue thy seruants burnt my field with fire?

32. And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? [it had been] good for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and 

33. Then Ioab came to the King, & told him: & he called for Absalom, who came to the King, and bowed himselfe to the grounde on his face before the King, and the King kissed Absalom.

## 2 Samuel 15

1. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to 

2. And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city [art] thou? And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the

4. Absalom said moreover, 

5. And when any man came neere to him, and did him obeisance, he put forth his hand, & tooke him, and kissed him.

6. And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom

8. For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will 

9. And the King sayd vnto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.

10. Then Absalom sent spyes throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When yee heare the sound of the trumpet, Ye shal say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

11. And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [that were] 

12. Also Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Dauids counseller, from his citie Giloh, while he offred sacrifices: & the treason was great: for the people encreased still with Absalom.

13. Then came a messenger to Dauid, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are turned after Absalom.

14. And David said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from 

15. And the Kings seruants sayd vnto him, Behold, thy seruants are ready to do according to all that my lord the King shal appoynt.

16. So the King departed and all his houshold after him, and the King left ten concubines to keepe the house.

17. And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was 

18. And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the 

19. Then said the king to 

20. Whereas thou camest [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy 

21. And Ittai answered the King, and sayde, As the Lorde liueth, and as my lord the King liueth, in what place my lord the King shalbe, whether in death or life, euen there surely will thy seruant bee.

22. Then Dauid sayd to Ittai, Come, & go forward; Ittai the Gittite went, and all his men, and all the children that were with him.

23. And all the country wept with a loud voice, and 

24. And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him, 

25. Then the King said vnto Zadok, Carie the Arke of God againe into the citie: if I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the Lorde, he will bring me againe, and shewe me both it, and the Tabernacle thereof.

26. But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, 

27. The King sayde againe vnto Zadok the Priest, Art not thou a Seer? returne into the citie in peace, and your two sonnes with you: to wit, Ahimaaz thy sonne, and Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar.

28. Behold, I wil tarie in the fieldes of the wildernesse, vntill there come some worde from you to be tolde me.

29. Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem, and they taried there.

30. And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head 

31. And [one] told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the 

32. Then Dauid came to the toppe of the mount where he worshipped God: and beholde, Hushai the Archite came against him with his coate torne, and hauing earth vpon his head.

33. Vnto whom Dauid sayd, If thou goe with me, thou shalt be a burthen vnto me.

34. But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy 

35. And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the Priests? therefore what so euer thou shalt heare out of the Kings house, thou shalt shew to Zadok and Abiathar the Priests.

36. Beholde, there are with them their two sonnes: Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne, and Ionathan Abiathars sonne: by them also shall ye send me euery thing that ye can heare.

37. So Hushai Dauids friend went into the citie: and Absalom came into Ierusalem.

4. Then said the King to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that perteined vnto Mephibosheth; Ziba saide, I beseech thee, let me finde grace in thy sight, my lord, O King.

5. And when king David came to

8. The LORD hath returned upon thee all the

10. And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath 

11. And Dauid sayd to Abishai, and to all his seruants, Beholde, my sonne which came out of mine owne bowels, seeketh my life: then howe much more now may this sonne of Iemini? Suffer him to curse: for the Lord hath bidden him.

12. It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will 

13. And as Dauid and his men went by the way, Shimei went by the side of the mountaine ouer against him, and cursed as he went, & threw stones against him, and cast dust.

14. And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves 

15. And Absalom, & all the people, the men of Israel, came to Ierusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

16. And when Hushai the Archite Dauids friend was come vnto Absalom, Hushai said vnto Absalom, God saue the King, God saue the King.

17. And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy 

18. Hushai then answered vnto Absalom, Nay, but whome the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel chuse, his will I be, and with him will I dwell.

19. And moreouer vnto whome shall I doe seruice? not to his sonne? as I serued before thy father, so will I before thee.

20. Then spake Absalom to Ahithophel, Giue counsell what we shall doe.

21. And 

22. So they spread Absalom a tent vpon the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his fathers concubines in the sight of all Israel.

23. And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man had 

## 2 Samuel 17

1. Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, 

2. And I will come vpon him: for he is wearie, and weake handed: so I will feare him, and all the people that are with him, shall flee, and I will smite the King onely,

3. And I will bring back all the people unto thee: 

4. And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the Elders of Israel.

5. Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let vs heare likewise what he sayth.

6. So when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spake vnto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken thus: shall we doe after his saying, or no? tell thou.

7. And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given [is] not 

8. For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father, and his men, that they be strong men, and are chafed in minde as a beare robbed of her whelps in the fielde: also thy father is a valiant warrier, and will not lodge with the people.

9. Behold, he is hid now in some caue, or in some place: and though some of them be ouerthrowen at the first, yet the people shall heare, and say, The people that follow Absalom, be ouerthrowen.

10. Then he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall shrinke and faint: for all Israel knoweth, that thy father is valiant, and they which be with him, stout men.

11. Therefore my counsell is, that all Israel be gathered vnto thee, from Dan euen to Beer-sheba as the sand of the sea in nomber, and that thou goe to battell in thine owne person.

12. So shall we come vpon him in some place, where we shall finde him, and we will vpon him as the dewe falleth on the ground: and of all the men that are with him, wee will not leaue him one.

13. Moreouer if he be gotten into a citie, then shall all the men of Israel bring ropes to that citie, and we will draw it into the riuer, vntill there be not one small stone founde there.

14. And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite [is] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the 

15. Then said Hushai vnto Zadok and to Abiathar the Priests, Of this and that maner did Ahithophel and the Elders of Israel counsell Absalom: and thus and thus haue I counseled.

16. Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass 

17. Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told 

18. Neuerthelesse a yong man sawe them, and tolde it to Absalom. therefore they both departed quickely, and came to a mans house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, into the which they went downe.

19. And 

20. And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where [is] Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the 

21. And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for 

22. Then David arose, and all the people that [were] with him, and they passed over Jordan: 

23. And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled [his] ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and 

24. Then Dauid came to Mahanaim; Absalom passed ouer Iorden, he, and all the men of Israel with him.

25. And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa [was] a man's son, whose name [was] Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of 

26. So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

28. 
          

29. And they brought honie, and butter, and sheepe, and cheese of kine for Dauid and for the people that were with him, to eate: for they said, The people is hungry, and wearie, and thirstie in the wildernesse.

## 2 Samuel 18

1. And David 

2. And Dauid sent foorth the third part of the people vnder the hand of Ioab, and the thirde part vnder the hand of Abishai Ioabs brother the sonne of Zeruiah: and the other third part vnder the hand of Ittai the Gittite; the King said vnto the people, I will go with you my selfe also.

3. But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but 

4. Then the King said vnto them, What seemeth you best, that I will doe. So the King stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreths and by thousands.

5. And the King commanded Ioab and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Entreate the yong man Absalom gently for my sake; all the people heard whe the King gaue al the captaines charge concerning Absalom.

6. So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the 

7. Where the people of Israel were slaine before the seruants of Dauid: so there was a great slaughter that day, euen of twentie thousande.

8. For the battel was skattered ouer all the countrey: and the wood deuoured much more people that day, then did the sworde.

9. Nowe Absalom met the seruants of Dauid, and Absalom rode vpon a mule, and the mule came vnder a great thicke oke: and his head caught holde of the oke, and he was taken vp betweene the heauen and the earth: and the mule that was vnder him went away.

10. And one that sawe it, tolde Ioab, saying, Beholde, I sawe Absalom hanged in an oke.

11. Then Ioab saide vnto the man that tolde him, And hast thou in deede seene? why then diddest thou not there smite him to the grounde, and I woulde haue giuen thee ten shekels of siluer, and a girdle?

12. Then the man saide vnto Ioab, Though I should receiue a thousande shekels of siluer in mine hande, yet woulde I not lay mine hande vpon the Kings sonne: for in our hearing the King charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Beware, least any touche the yong man Absalom.

13. If I had done it, it had bene the danger of my life: for nothing can be hid from the King: yea, thou thy selfe wouldest haue bin against me.

14. Then saide Ioab, I will not thus tary with thee; he tooke three dartes in his hande, and thrust them through Absalom, while he was yet aliue in the middes of the oke.

15. And tenne seruants that bare Ioabs armour, compassed about and smote Absalom, and slewe him.

16. And Joab 

17. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great

20. And Joab said unto him, Thou 

21. Then said Ioab to Cushi, Goe, tel the king, what thou hast seene; Cushi bowed himselfe vnto Ioab, and ran.

22. Then saide Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok againe to Ioab, What, I pray thee, if I also runne after Cushi? And Ioab said, Wherefore now wilt thou runne, my sonne, seeing that thou hast no tidings to bring?

23. Yet what if I runne? Then he saide vnto him, Runne. So Ahimaaz ranne by the way of the plaine, and ouerwent Cushi.

24. And David sat between the two 

25. And the watchman cryed, & tolde ye king; the King said, If he be alone, he bringeth tidings; he came apace, and drew neere.

26. And the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called vnto the porter, and said, Behold, another man runneth alone; the King said, He also bringeth tidings.

27. And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a 

28. And Ahimaaz called, and sayde vnto the King, Peace be with thee: and he fell downe to the earth vpon his face before the King, and saide, Blessed be the Lorde thy God, who hath shut vp the men that lift vp their handes against my lorde the King.

29. And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's 

30. And the King said vnto him, Turne aside, and stand here. so he turned aside & stoode still.

31. And beholde, Cushi came, and Cushi saide, Tidings, my lorde the King: for the Lord hath deliuered thee this day out of the hande of all that rose against thee.

32. Then the King saide vnto Cushi, Is the yong man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lorde the King, and all that rise against thee to doe thee hurt, be as that yong man is.

33. And the king was much 

## 2 Samuel 19

1. And it was tolde Ioab, Behold, the King weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.

2. Therefore the victorie of that day was turned into mourning to all the people: for the people heard say that day, The King soroweth for his sonne.

3. And the people went that day into the citie secretly, as people confounded hide them selues when they flee in battell.

4. But the king 

5. And Joab came into the

7. Nowe therefore vp, come out, and speake comfortably vnto thy seruants: for I sweare by the Lorde, except thou come out, there will not tarie one man with thee this night: and that wil be worse vnto thee, then all the euill that fell on thee from thy youth hitherto.

8. Then the king arose, and sat in the

11. And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the 

12. Ye are my brethren: my bones and my flesh are ye: wherefore then are ye the last that bring the King againe?

13. And say ye to Amasa, [Art] thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the 

14. So he bowed the heartes of all the men of Iudah, as of one man: therefore they sent to the King, saying, Returne thou with all thy seruants.

15. So the King returned, and came to Iorden; Iudah came to Gilgal, for to goe to meete the King, and to conduct him ouer Iorde.

16. And 

17. And a thousande men of Beniamin with him, and Ziba the seruant of the house of Saul, and his fifteene sonnes and twentie seruants with him: and they went ouer Iorden before ye king.

18. And there went ouer a boate to carie ouer the Kings houshold, and to do him pleasure. Then Shimei the sonne of Gera fell before the King, when he was come ouer Iorden,

19. And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did 

20. For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of 

21. But Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah answered, and said, Shal not Shimei die for this, because he cursed the Lordes anoynted?

22. And Dauid saide, What haue I to do with you, ye sonnes of Zeruiah, that this day ye should be aduersaries vnto me? Shall there any man die this day in Israel? For doe not I know that I am this day King ouer Israel?

23. Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not 

24. And Mephibosheth the sonne of Saul came downe to meete the king, and had neither washed his feete, nor dressed his beard, nor washed his clothes from the time the king departed, vntill he returned in peace.

25. And it came to pass, when 

26. And he answered, My lorde the king, my seruant deceiued me: for thy seruant said, I would haue mine asse sadled to ride thereon, for to goe with the king, because thy seruant is lame.

27. And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king [is] as an

30. And Mephibosheth saide vnto the king, Yea, let him take all, seeing my lorde the king is come home in peace.

31. Then Barzillai the Gileadite came downe from Rogelim, & went ouer Iorden with the king, to conduct him ouer Iorden.

32. Nowe Barzillai was a very aged man, euen fourescore yeere olde, and he had prouided the king of sustenance, while he lay at Mahanaim: for he was a man of very great substance.

33. And the king said vnto Barzillai, Come ouer with me, and I will feede thee with me in Ierusalem.

34. And Barzillai said vnto the king, Howe long haue I to liue, that I should goe vp with the king to Ierusalem?

35. I [am] this day fourscore years old: [and] can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a 

36. Thy seruant will goe a litle way ouer Iorden with the King, and why wil the king recompence it me with such a rewarde?

37. Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, [and be buried] by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant 

38. And the king answered, Chimham shal go with me, and I will do to him that thou shalt be content with: and whatsoeuer thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

39. So all the people went ouer Iorden: and the King passed ouer: and the King kissed Barzillai, and blessed him, and hee returned vnto his owne place.

40. Then the king went on to

42. And all the men of Iudah answered the men of Israel, Because the King is neere of kin to vs: and wherefore now be ye angry for this matter? Haue we eaten of the Kings cost, or haue wee taken any bribes?

43. And the men of Israel answered the men of Iudah, and saide, Wee haue ten partes in the King, and haue also more right to Dauid then ye: Why then did ye despise vs, that our aduise should not bee first had in restoring our King? And the wordes of the men of Iudah were fiercer then the wordes of the men of Israel.

10. But Amasa tooke no heede to the sworde that was in Ioabs hande: for therewith he smote him in the fift rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and smote him not the second time: so he dyed. then Ioab and Abishai his brother followed after Sheba the sonne of Bichri.

11. And one of Joab's men 

12. And Amasa wallowed in blood in the mids of the way: and when the man sawe that all the people stood still, he remooued Amasa out of the way into the fielde, and cast a cloth vpon him, because he saw that euery one that came by him, stoode still.

13. When hee was remoued out of the way, euerie man went after Ioab, to followe after Sheba the sonne of Bichri.

17. And when hee came neere vnto her, the woma said, Art thou Ioab? And he answered, Yea; she said to him, Heare the wordes of thine handmaid; he answered, I do heare.
