## Ecclesiastes 1

1. The words of the 

2. 
          

3. What profit hath a man of all his 

4. [One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for 

5. The sunne riseth, and ye sunne goeth downe, and draweth to his place, where he riseth.

6. The 

7. All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; to the place from 

8. All things are full of labour: man cannot vtter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare filled with hearing.

9. 
          

10. Is there any thing, whereof one may say, Beholde this, it is newe? It hath bene already in the olde time that was before vs.

11. There is no memorie of the former, neither shall there be a remembrance of the latter that shalbe, with them that shall come after.

12. 
          

13. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this grievous labour hath God given to the sons of man 

14. I haue considered all the workes that are done vnder the sunne, and beholde, all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.

15. [That which is] 

16. I thought in mine heart, and said, Behold, I am become great, and excell in wisdome all them that haue bene before me in Ierusalem: and mine heart hath seene much wisedome and knowledge.

17. And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know 

18. For in much wisdom [is] much 

## Ecclesiastes 2

1. I said in my heart, Come now, I will tempt 

2. I saide of laughter, Thou art mad: and of ioy, What is this that thou doest?

3. I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart with 

4. I haue made my great workes: I haue built me houses: I haue planted me vineyards.

5. I haue made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruite.

6. I haue made me cisternes of water, to water therewith the woods that growe with trees.

7. I procured [me] male and female servants, and had servants born in my 

8. I gathered me also silver and gold, and the special treasure of kings and of the provinces: I procured me male and female singers, and the 

9. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom 

10. And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my 

11. Then I looked on all my workes that mine hands had wrought, and on the trauaile that I had laboured to doe: and beholde, all is vanitie and vexation of the spirit: and there is no profite vnder the sunne.

12. And I turned myself to behold 

13. Then I saw that there is profite in wisdome, more then in follie: as the light is more excellent then darkenes.

14. The wise man's 

15. Then I thought in mine heart, It befalleth vnto me, as it befalleth to ye foole. Why therefore doe I then labour to be more wise? And I sayd in mine heart, that this also is vanitie.

16. For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool 

17. Therefore I hated life: for the worke that is wrought vnder the sunne is grieuous vnto me: for all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.

18. I hated also all my labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne, which I shall leaue to the man that shalbe after me.

19. And who knoweth whether he shalbe wise or foolish? yet shall hee haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue trauailed, and wherein I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the sunne. This is also vanitie.

20. Therefore I went about to cause my heart 

21. For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured in it shall he 

22. For what hath man of all his trauaile and griefe of his heart, wherein he hath trauailed vnder the sunne?

23. For all his dayes are sorowes, and his trauaile griefe: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanitie.

24. [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should 

25. For who can eat, or who else can hasten 

26. Surely to a man that is good in his sight, God giueth wisdome, and knowledge, and ioy: but to the sinner he giueth paine, to gather, and to heape to giue to him that is good before God: this is also vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.

## Ecclesiastes 3

1. To every [thing there is] a 

2. A time to bee borne, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted.

3. A time to slay, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to builde.

4. A time to weepe, and a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance.

5. A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones: a time to embrace, and a time to be farre from embracing.

6. A time to seeke, and a time to lose: a time to keepe, and a time to cast away.

7. A time to rent, and a time to sowe: a time to keepe silence, and a time to speake.

8. A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace.

9. What profite hath hee that worketh of the thing wherein he trauaileth?

10. I have seen the labour, which God hath given to the sons of men 

11. He hath made every [thing] beautiful in its time: also he hath set the 

12. I know that there is nothing good in them, but to reioyce, and to doe good in his life.

13. And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the 

14. I know that, whatever God doeth, it shall be for 

15. That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God 

16. And moreouer I haue seene vnder the sunne the place of iudgement, where was wickednesse, and the place of iustice where was iniquitie.

17. I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time 

18. I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men, that God might 

19. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing 

20. All goe to one place, & all was of the dust, and all shall returne to the dust.

21. Who 

22. Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should 

## Ecclesiastes 4

1. So 

2. Wherefore I praised the 

3. Yea, 

4. Again, I considered all labour, and every 

5. The fool foldeth his hands together, and 

6. Better is an handfull with quietnesse, then two handfuls with labour and vexation of spirit.

7. Againe I returned, and sawe vanitie vnder the sunne.

8. There is one alone, & there is not a second, which hath neither sonne nor brother, yet is there none end of all his trauaile, neither can his eye be satisfied with riches: neither doeth he thinke, For whome doe I trauaile and defraude my soule of pleasure? this also is vanitie, and this is an euill trauaile.

9. 
          

10. For if they fal, the one wil lift vp his felow: but wo vnto him that is alone: for he falleth, and there is not a second to lift him vp.

11. Also if two sleepe together, then shall they haue heate: but to one how should there be heate?

12. And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold 

13. Better is a poore and wise childe, then an olde and foolish King, which will no more be admonished.

14. For out of 

15. I considered all the living who walk under the sun, 

16. [There is] no 

## Ecclesiastes 5

1. Keep thy 

2. Be not 

3. {\cf2 (5:2)} For as a dreame commeth by the multitude of businesse: so the voyce of a foole is in the multitude of wordes.

4. When thou vowest a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for [he hath] no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast 

5. {\cf2 (5:4)} It is better that thou shouldest not vowe, then that thou shouldest vow and not pay it.

6. Allow not thy mouth to cause thy 

7. {\cf2 (5:6)} For in the multitude of dreames, and vanities are also many wordes: but feare thou God.

8. If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, wonder not at the matter: for [he that is] 

9. Moreover the 

10. {\cf2 (5:9)} He that loueth siluer, shall not be satisfied with siluer, and he that loueth riches, shalbe without the fruite thereof: this also is vanitie.

11. {\cf2 (5:10)} When goods increase, they are increased that eate them: and what good commeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding thereof with their eyes?

12. The sleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eateth little or much: but the 

13. There is a grievous evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches 

14. But those riches perish by evil labour: and he begetteth a son, and [there is] nothing in his 

15. {\cf2 (5:14)} As hee came foorth of his mothers belly, he shall returne naked to goe as he came, and shal beare away nothing of his labour, which hee hath caused to passe by his hand.

16. And this also [is] a grievous evil, [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the 

17. All his days also he eateth in 

18. Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and proper [for one] to 

19. {\cf2 (5:18)} Also to euery man to whom God hath giuen riches and treasures, and giueth him power to eate thereof, and to take his part, and to enioy his labour: this is the gift of God.

20. For he shall not much remember the days of his 

## Ecclesiastes 6

1. There is an euill, which I sawe vnder the sunne, and it is much among men:

2. A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet 

3. If a man begetteth an hundred [children], and liveth many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not 

4. For 

5. Also he hath not seene ye sunne, nor knowen it: therefore this hath more rest then the other.

6. And if he had liued a thousand yeeres twise tolde, and had seene no good, shall not all goe to one place?

7. All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the 

8. For what hath the wise man more then the foole? what hath the poore that knoweth how to walke before the liuing?

9. Better [is] the 

10. That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it [is] man: neither may he contend with him that is 

11. {\cf2 (7:1)} Svrely there be many things that increase vanitie: and what auaileth it man?

12. For who knoweth what [is] 

## Ecclesiastes 7

1. A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of 

2. [It is] better to go to the house of 

3. {\cf2 (7:5)} Anger is better then laughter: for by a sad looke the heart is made better.

4. {\cf2 (7:6)} The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning: but the heart of fooles is in the house of mirth.

5. {\cf2 (7:7)} Better it is to heare ye rebuke of a wise man, then that a man should heare the song of fooles.

6. For as the crackling of 

7. Surely oppression maketh a wise man 

8. Better [is] the 

9. {\cf2 (7:11)} Be not thou of an hastie spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosome of fooles.

10. Say not thou, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire 

11. Wisdom [is] good with an 

12. {\cf2 (7:14)} For man shall rest in the shadowe of wisedome, and in the shadowe of siluer: but the excellencie of the knowledge of wisedome giueth life to the possessers thereof.

13. {\cf2 (7:15)} Beholde the worke of God: for who can make straight that which he hath made crooked?

14. In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity 

15. All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perisheth in his 

16. Be not righteous 

17. Be not 

18. [It is] good that thou shouldest take hold of 

19. {\cf2 (7:21)} Wisedome shall strengthen the wise man more then ten mightie princes that are in ye citie.

20. {\cf2 (7:22)} Surely there is no man iust in the earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.

21. Also take no 

22. {\cf2 (7:24)} For often times also thine heart knoweth that thou likewise hast cursed others.

23. {\cf2 (7:2)} All this haue I prooued by wisedome: I thought I will be wise, but it went farre from me.

24. That which is far off, 

25. {\cf2 (7:27)} I haue compassed about, both I and mine heart to knowe and to enquire and to search wisedome, and reason, and to knowe the wickednesse of follie, and the foolishnesse of madnesse,

26. {\cf2 (7:28)} And I finde more bitter then death the woman whose heart is as nettes and snares, and her handes, as bands: he that is good before God, shalbe deliuered from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.

27. Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, [counting] one by one, to 

28. {\cf2 (7:30)} And yet my soule seeketh, but I finde it not: I haue found one man of a thousand: but a woman among them all haue I not founde.

29. Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many 

## Ecclesiastes 8

1. Who [is] as the wise [man]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face 

2. I [counsel thee] to keep the king's 

3. 
          

4. Where the word of ye King is, there is power, and who shall say vnto him, What doest thou?

5. He who keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both 

6. Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the 

7. For he knoweth not that which shalbe: for who can tell him when it shalbe?

8. [There is] no man that hath power 

9. All this have I seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: [there is] a time in which one man ruleth over another to his own 

10. And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and 

11. Because sentence against an evil work is not 

12. Though a sinner doe euill an hundreth times, and God prolongeth his dayes, yet I knowe that it shalbe well with them that feare the Lord, and doe reuerence before him.

13. But it shall not be well to the wicked, neither shall he prolong his dayes: he shall be like a shadowe, because he feareth not before God.

14. There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just [men], to whom it happeneth according to the 

15. Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than 

16. When I applied mine heart to knowe wisedome, and to behold the busines that is done on earth, that neither day nor night the eyes of man take sleepe,

17. Then I behelde the whole worke of God, that man cannot finde out ye worke that is wrought vnder the sunne: for the which man laboureth to seeke it, and cannot finde it: yea, and though the wise man thinke to knowe it, he cannot finde it.

## Ecclesiastes 9

1. For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, [are] in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or 

2. All things come alike to all: and the same condition is to the iust and to the wicked, to the good and to the pure, and to the polluted, and to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner, he that sweareth, as he that feareth an othe.

3. This [is] an evil among all [things] that are done under the sun, that [there is] one 

4. For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a 

5. For the liuing knowe that they shall dye, but the dead knowe nothing at all: neither haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembrance is forgotten.

6. Also their loue, and their hatred, and their enuie is now perished, and they haue no more portion for euer, in all that is done vnder the sunne.

7. Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now 

8. Let thy garments be always 

9. Reioyce with the wife whom thou hast loued all the dayes of the life of thy vanitie, which God hath giuen thee vnder the sunne all the dayes of thy vanitie: for this is thy portion in the life, and in thy trauaile wherein thou labourest vnder the sunne.

10. All that thine hand shall finde to doe, doe it with all thy power: for there is neither worke nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wisedome in the graue whither thou goest.

11. I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race [is] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and 

12. For man also knoweth not his 

13. I haue also seene this wisedome vnder the sunne, and it is great vnto me.

14. A litle citie and fewe men in it, and a great King came against it, and compassed it about, and builded fortes against it.

15. And there was founde therein a poore and wise man, and he deliuered the citie by his wisedome: but none remembred this poore man.

16. Then said I, Better is wisdome then stregth: yet the wisedome of the poore is despised, and his wordes are not heard.

17. The wordes of the wise are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

18. Better is wisedome then weapons of warre: but one sinner destroyeth much good.

## Ecclesiastes 10

1. Dead flies cause to stinke, & putrifie the ointment of the apoticarie: so doeth a litle follie him that is in estimation for wisedome, and for glorie.

2. A 

3. Also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth [him], and he 

4. If the 

5. There is an evil [which] I have seen under the sun, as an 

6. Folly is set in great dignity, and the 

7. I haue seene seruants on horses, and princes walking as seruants on the ground.

8. He that diggeth a pit, shall fal into it, and he that breaketh the hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

9. He that remooueth stones, shall hurt himselfe thereby, and hee that cutteth wood, shall be in danger thereby.

10. If the iron is blunt, and he doth not whet the edge, then must he use more 

11. If the serpent bite, when he is not charmed: no better is a babbler.

12. The words of ye mouth of a wise man haue grace: but the lippes of a foole deuoure himselfe.

13. The beginning of the wordes of his mouth is foolishnesse, and the latter ende of his mouth is wicked madnesse.

14. For the foole multiplieth woordes, saying, Man knoweth not what shall be: and who can tell him what shall be after him?

15. The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the 

16. Woe to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a 

17. Blessed [art] thou, O land, when thy king [is] the son 

18. By slouthfulnes the roofe of the house goeth to decaie, and by the ydlenesse of the handes the house droppeth through.

19. They prepare bread for laughter, and wine comforteth the liuing, but siluer answereth to all.

20. Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a 

## Ecclesiastes 11

1. Cast thy bread upon the 

2. Giue a portion to seuen, & also to eight: for thou knowest not what euill shalbe vpon ye earth.

3. If the 

4. He that observeth the 

5. As thou knowest not which is ye way of the spirit, nor how the bones doe growe in the wombe of her that is with child: so thou knowest not the worke of God that worketh all.

6. In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening 

7. Surely the light is a pleasant thing: and it is a good thing to the eyes to see the sunne.

8. But if a man shall live many years, [and] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of

10. Therefore remove 

## Ecclesiastes 12

1. Remember nowe thy Creator in the daies of thy youth, whiles the euill daies come not, nor the yeeres approche, wherein thou shalt say, I haue no pleasure in them:

2. While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, are not darkened, nor the 

3. In the day when the 

4. And the 

5. Also [when] they shall be afraid of [that which is] 

6. Or ever the 

7. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the 

8. Vanitie of vanities, saieth the Preacher, all is vanitie.

9. And the more wise the Preacher was, the more he taught the people knowledge, and caused them to heare, and searched foorth, and prepared many parables.

10. The Preacher sought to finde out pleasant wordes, and an vpright writing, euen the wordes of trueth.

11. The words of the wise [are] as goads, and as nails 

12. And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many 

13. Let vs heare the end of all: feare God and keepe his commandements: for this is the whole duetie of man.

14. For God will bring euery worke vnto iudgement, with euery secret thing, whether it be good or euill.
