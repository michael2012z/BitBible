# Hebrews

## Hebrews 1

1. God, having of old time spoken to the fathers in the prophets by diverse portions and in diverse manners,

2. has at the end of these days spoken to us in [his] Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the ages;

3. who being the radiance of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;

4. having become by so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they.

5. For to which of the angels did he say at any time, You are my Son, This day I have begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, And he will be to me a Son?

6. And when he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.

7. And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, And his ministers a flame of fire:

8. but of the Son [he says,] Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; And the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.

9. You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your peers.

10. And, You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of your hands:

11. They will perish; but you continue: And they will all wear out as does a garment;

12. And as a mantle you will roll them up, As a garment, and they will be changed: But you are the same, And your years will not fail.

13. But of which of the angels has he said at any time, Sit at my right hand, Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?

14. Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?

## Hebrews 2

1. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away [from them].

2. For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;

3. how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? Which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;

4. God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.

5. For not to angels did he subject the world to come, of which we speak.

6. But one has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that you visit him?

7. You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor.

8. You put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not see yet all things subjected to him.

9. But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, [even] Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every [man].

10. For it was fitting for him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

11. For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,

12. saying, I will declare your name to my brothers, Among the congregation I will sing your praise.

13. And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Look, I and the children whom God has given me.

14. Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil;

15. and might deliver all those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to slavery.

16. For truly not to angels does he give help, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.

17. Therefore it behooved him in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.

18. For in that he himself has suffered being tried, he is able to help those who are being tried.

## Hebrews 3

1. Therefore, holy brothers, sharers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, [even] Jesus;

2. who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.

3. For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he who built the house has more honor than the house.

4. For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.

5. And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;

6. but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope.

7. Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you{+} will hear his voice,

8. Do not harden your{+} hearts, as in the provocation, Like in the day of the trial in the wilderness,

9. Where your{+} fathers tried [me] by proving [me,] and saw my works.

10. Therefore, for forty years I was displeased with this generation, And said, They always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;

11. As I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest.

12. Take heed, brothers, lest perhaps there will be in any one of you{+} an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:

13. but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called Today; lest any one of you{+} be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:

14. for we have become sharers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:

15. while it is said, Today if you{+} will hear his voice, Do not harden your{+} hearts, as in the provocation.

16. For who, when they heard, provoked? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?

17. And with whom was he displeased forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?

18. And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?

19. And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.

## Hebrews 4

1. Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you{+} should seem to have come short of it.

2. For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also [did]: but the word of hearing did not profit those who were not united in the faith with those who heard.

3. For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, They will not enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

4. For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;

5. and in this [place] again, They will not enter into my rest.

6. Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to whom the good news was formerly preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,

7. he again defines a certain day, Today, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as has been said before), Today if you{+} will hear his voice, Do not harden your{+} hearts.

8. For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.

9. There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

10. For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.

11. Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.

12. For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.

13. And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

14. Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.

15. For we do not have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one who has been in all points tried like [we are, yet] without sin.

16. Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help [us] in time of need.

## Hebrews 5

1. For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:

2. who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is surrounded by infirmity;

3. and by reason of it is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

4. And no man takes the honor to himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.

5. So Christ also did not glorify himself to be made a high priest, but he who spoke to him, You are my Son, This day I have begotten you:

6. as he says also in another [place,] You are a priest forever After the order of Melchizedek.

7. Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,

8. though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;

9. and having been made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the author of eternal salvation;

10. named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

11. Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing you{+} have become dull of hearing.

12. For when by reason of the time you{+} ought to be teachers, you{+} have need again that some one teach you{+} the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and have become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.

13. For everyone who partakes of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a juvenile.

14. But solid food is for full-grown men, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.

## Hebrews 6

1. Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

2. of teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

3. And this we will do, if God permits.

4. For as concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made sharers of the Holy Spirit,

5. and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,

6. and [then] fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.

7. For the land which has drank the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God:

8. but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near to a curse; whose end is to be burned.

9. But we are persuaded of you{+}, beloved, better things that follow salvation, though we thus speak:

10. for God is not unrighteous to forget your{+} work and the love which you{+} showed toward his name, in that you{+} served the saints, and still do serve.

11. And we desire that each of you{+} may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end:

12. that you{+} are not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

13. For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,

14. saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.

15. And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

16. For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.

17. In which God, being minded to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;

18. that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:

19. which we have as an anchor of the soul; both sure and steadfast; and entering into that which is inside the veil;

20. where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

## Hebrews 7

1. For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,

2. to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;

3. without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), stays a priest continually.

4. Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.

5. And they indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:

6. but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.

7. But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.

8. And here men who die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.

9. And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes;

10. for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.

11. Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it has the people received the law), what further need [was there] that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?

12. For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

13. For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no man has given attendance at the altar.

14. For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.

15. And [what we say] is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there rises another priest,

16. who has been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:

17. for it is witnessed [of him,] You are a priest forever After the order of Melchizedek.

18. For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness

19. (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.

20. And inasmuch as [it is] not without the taking of an oath

21. (for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him who says of him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest forever);

22. by so much also has Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.

23. And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because by death they are hindered from staying [as priest]:

24. but he, because he stays forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.

25. Therefore also he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.

26. For such was indeed fitting for us [as] a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

27. who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the [sins] of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.

28. For the law appoints men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, [appoints] a Son, perfected forever.

## Hebrews 8

1. Now in the things which we are saying the chief point [is this]: We have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,

2. a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.

3. For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: therefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer.

4. Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;

5. who serve [that which is] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned [of God] when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, he says, that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mount.

6. But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.

7. For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.

8. For finding fault with them, he says, Look, the days come, says the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;

9. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in my covenant, And I did not regard them, says the Lord.

10. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also I will write them: And I will be to them a God, And they will be to me a people:

11. And they will not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all will know me, From the least to the greatest of them.

12. For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins I will remember no more.

13. In that he says, New, he has made the first obsolete. But that which is becoming obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.

## Hebrews 9

1. Now even the first [covenant] also had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, [a sanctuary] of this world.

2. For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, in which [were] the lampstand, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.

3. And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;

4. having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid around with gold, in which [was] a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;

5. and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we can't now speak severally.

6. Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;

7. but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance:

8. the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place has not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;

9. which [is] a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that can't, as concerning the conscience, make the worshiper perfect,

10. [being] only (with meats and drinks and diverse washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.

11. But Christ having come [as] high priest of the good things that have come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,

12. nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.

13. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:

14. how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

15. And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

16. For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.

17. For a testament is of force where there has been death: for it does never avail while he who made it lives.

18. Therefore even the first [covenant] has not been dedicated without blood.

19. For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,

20. saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded toward you{+}.

21. Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.

22. And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.

23. It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.

24. For Christ didn't enter into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:

25. nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;

26. or else he must have often suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the very end of the [past] ages he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

27. And inasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this [comes] judgment;

28. so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, apart from sin, to those who wait for him, to salvation.

## Hebrews 10

1. For the law having a shadow of the good [things] to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.

2. Or else would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.

3. But in those [sacrifices] there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.

4. For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.

5. Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you did not want, But you prepared a body for me;

6. In whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin you had no pleasure:

7. Then I said, Look, I have come (In the roll of the book it is written of me) To do your will, O God.

8. Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin you did not want, neither had pleasure in them (which are offered according to the law),

9. then he has said, Look, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.

10. By whose will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

11. And every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:

12. but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God;

13. from now on expecting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.

14. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.

15. And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after he has said,

16. This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And on their mind also I will write them; [then he says,]

17. And their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.

18. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.

19. Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,

20. by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

21. and [having] a great priest over the house of God;

22. let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed in pure water,

23. let us hold fast the confession of the unwavering hope; for he who promised is faithful:

24. and let us consider one another to provoke to love and good works;

25. not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting [one another]; and so much the more, as you{+} see the day drawing near.

26. For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,

27. but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.

28. A man who has set at nothing Moses' law dies without compassion on [the word of] two or three witnesses:

29. of how much sorer punishment, do you{+} think, he will be judged worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified a common thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?

30. For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord will judge his people.

31. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

32. But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you{+} were enlightened, you{+} endured a great conflict of sufferings;

33. partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partners with those who were so used.

34. For you{+} both had compassion on those who were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your{+} possessions, knowing that you{+} yourselves have a better possession and a staying one.

35. Do not cast away therefore your{+} boldness, which has great recompense of reward.

36. For you{+} have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, you{+} may receive the promise.

37. For yet a very little while, He who comes will come, and will not tarry.

38. But my righteous one will live by faith: And if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.

39. But we are not of those who shrink back to perdition; but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.

## Hebrews 11

1. Now faith is assurance of [things] hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.

2. For in this the elders had witness borne to them.

3. By faith we understand that the ages have been provided by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which appear.

4. By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaks.

5. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he has had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing to God:

6. And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing [to him]; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of those who seek after him.

7. By faith Noah, being warned [of God] concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

8. By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he went.

9. By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a [land] not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:

10. for he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose craftsman and builder is God.

11. By faith even Sarah herself, who was barren, received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:

12. therefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the seashore, innumerable.

13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

14. For those who say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.

15. And if indeed they had been mindful of that [country] from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.

16. But now they desire a better [country], that is, a heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.

17. By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: and he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten;

18. even he to whom it was said, In Isaac will your seed be called:

19. accounting that God [is] able to raise up, even from the dead; from where he did also in a figure receive him back.

20. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.

21. By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshiped, [leaning] on the top of his staff.

22. By faith Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.

23. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his fathers, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.

24. By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

25. choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

26. accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked to the recompense of reward.

27. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

28. By faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.

29. By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.

30. By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been circled for seven days.

31. By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.

32. And what shall I say more? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:

33. who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

34. quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.

35. Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:

36. and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

37. they were stoned, they were sawn apart, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated

38. (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.

39. And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, did not receive the promise,

40. God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.

## Hebrews 12

1. Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

2. looking to Jesus the author and perfecter of [our] faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3. For consider him who has endured such opposing of sinners against himself, that you{+} do not wax weary, fainting in your{+} souls.

4. You{+} have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin:

5. and you{+} have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you{+} as with sons, My son, do not regard lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when you are reproved of him;

6. For whom the Lord loves he chastens, And scourges every son whom he receives.

7. It is for chastening that you{+} endure; God deals with you{+} as with sons; for what son is there whom [his] father does not chasten?

8. But if you{+} are without chastening, of which all have been made sharers, then you{+} are bastards, and not sons.

9. Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: and shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?

10. For they indeed for a few days chastened [us] as seemed good to them; but he for [our] profit, that [we] may be partakers of his holiness.

11. And all chastening seems for the present not to be joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields peaceable fruit to those who have been exercised by it, [even the fruit] of righteousness.

12. Therefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;

13. and make straight paths for your{+} feet, that that which is lame not be turned out of the way, but rather be healed.

14. Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord:

15. looking carefully lest [there be] any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you{+}], and by it many be defiled;

16. lest [there be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.

17. For you{+} know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind [in his father,] though he sought it diligently with tears.

18. For you{+} have not come to [a mount] that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,

19. and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] those who heard entreated that no word more should be spoken to them;

20. for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned;

21. and so fearful was the appearance, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:

22. but you{+} have come to mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels in a festive gathering,

23. and to the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,

24. and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than [that of] Abel.

25. See that you{+} do not refuse him who speaks. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned [them] on earth, much more [will] we [not escape] who turn away from him who [warns] from heaven:

26. whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.

27. And this [word], Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may stay.

28. Therefore, receiving a kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:

29. for our God is a consuming fire.

## Hebrews 13

1. Let the love for the brothers stay.

2. Do not forget the love for strangers: for by this some have unknowingly received angels as guests.

3. Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; those who are illtreated, as being yourselves also in the body.

4. [Let] marriage [be] had in honor among all, and [let] the bed [be] undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.

5. Be{+} free from the love of money; content with such things as you{+} have: for he himself has said, I will never fail you, neither will I ever forsake you.

6. So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; and I will not fear: What will man do to me?

7. Remember those who had the rule over you{+}, men who spoke to you{+} the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.

8. Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday and today, and forever.

9. Don't be carried away by diverse and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, in which those who are occupied in them were not profited.

10. We have an altar, of which they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.

11. For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest [as an offering] for sin, are burned outside the camp.

12. Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside the gate.

13. Let us therefore go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.

14. For we do not have a city that stays here, but we seek after [the city] which is to come.

15. Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.

16. But to do good and to communicate do not forget: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

17. Obey those who have the rule over you{+}, and submit [to them]: for they watch in behalf of your{+} souls, as those who will give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this [would be] unprofitable for you{+}.

18. Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.

19. And I exhort [you{+}] the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you{+} the sooner.

20. Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, [even] our Lord Jesus,

21. provide you{+} with every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.

22. But I exhort you{+}, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written to you{+} in few words.

23. Know{+} that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you{+}.

24. Greet all those who have the rule over you{+}, and all the saints. They of Italy greet you{+}.

25. Grace be with all of you{+}.
