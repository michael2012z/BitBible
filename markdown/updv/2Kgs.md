## 2 Kings 1

1. And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

2. And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.

3. But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you{+} go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?

4. Now therefore thus says Yahweh, You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but will surely die. And Elijah departed.

5. And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that you{+} have returned?

6. And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you{+}, and say to him, Thus says Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but will surely die.

7. And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you{+}, and told you{+} these words?

8. And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girded with a belt of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.

9. Then [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and saw that he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spoke to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down.

10. And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.

11. And again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.

12. And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.

13. And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pled to him for mercy, and said to him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty slaves of yours, be precious in your sight.

14. Look, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.

15. And the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with him: don't be afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.

16. And he said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but will surely die.

17. So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.

18. Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 2 Kings 2

1. And it came to pass, when Yahweh was to take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.

2. And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for Yahweh has sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Beth-el.

3. And the sons of the prophets who were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold your{+} peace.

4. And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.

5. And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold your{+} peace.

6. And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray you; for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And both of them went on.

7. And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood across from them far off: and both of them stood by the Jordan.

8. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that both of them went over on dry ground.

9. And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I will do for you, before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.

10. And he said, You have asked a hard thing: [nevertheless], if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so to you; but if not, it will not be so.

11. And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, look, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which separated them both apart; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

12. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

13. He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.

14. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah, even he? And when he had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.

15. And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho across from him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.

16. And they said to him, Look now, there are with your slaves fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master, in case the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You{+} will not send.

17. And when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but did not find him.

18. And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said to them, Didn't I say to you{+}, Don't go?

19. And the men of the city said to Elisha, Look, we pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.

20. And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.

21. And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt in it, and said, Thus says Yahweh, I have healed these waters; there will not be from there anymore death or miscarrying.

22. So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.

23. And he went up from there to Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead.

24. And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. And there came forth two she-bears out of the forest, and tore forty and two lads of them.

25. And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.

## 2 Kings 3

1. Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.

2. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.

3. Nevertheless he stuck to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart therefrom.

4. Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.

5. But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

6. And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.

7. And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.

8. And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.

9. So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.

10. And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.

11. But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him? And one of the king of Israel's slaves answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.

12. And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.

13. And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No; for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.

14. And Elisha said, As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.

15. But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came upon him.

16. And he said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.

17. For thus says Yahweh, You{+} will not see wind, neither will you{+} see rain; yet that valley will be filled with water, and you{+} will drink, both you{+} and your{+} cattle and your{+} beasts.

18. And this is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh: he will also deliver the Moabites into your{+} hand.

19. And you{+} will strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and will fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.

20. And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, look, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.

21. Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.

22. And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water across from them as red as blood:

23. and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each man his fellow man: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.

24. And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went there and struck the Moabites.

25. And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until they left [only] its stones in Kir-hareseth; nevertheless the slingers went about it, and struck it.

26. And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too intense for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword, to break through to the king of Syria; but they could not.

27. Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering on the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

## 2 Kings 4

1. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your slave my husband is dead; and you know that your slave did fear Yahweh: and the creditor has come to take to him my two children to be slaves.

2. And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me; what do you have in the house? And she said, Your slave doesn't have anything in the house, but a pot of oil.

3. Then he said, Go, borrow for yourself vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; don't borrow a few.

4. And you will go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you will set aside that which is full.

5. So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.

6. And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped.

7. Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and you and your sons live from the rest.

8. And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.

9. And she said to her husband, Look now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.

10. Let us make, I pray you, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand: and it will be, when he comes to us, that he will turn in there.

11. And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.

12. And he said to Gehazi his attendant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.

13. And he said to him, Say now to her, Look, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? Would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.

14. And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no son, and her husband is old.

15. And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.

16. And he said, At this season, when the time comes round, you will embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your slave.

17. And the woman became pregnant, and gave birth to a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.

18. And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.

19. And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to his attendant, Carry him to his mother.

20. And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.

21. And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him, and went out.

22. And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the attendants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.

23. And he said, Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath. And she said, It will be well.

24. Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her attendant, Drive, and go forward; don't slow down the riding for me, except I bid you.

25. So she went, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her far off, that he said to Gehazi his attendant, Look, yonder is the Shunammite:

26. run, I pray you, now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.

27. And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed inside her; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.

28. Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Don't deceive me?

29. Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, don't greet him; and if any greets you, don't answer him again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.

30. And the mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.

31. And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child did not awaken.

32. And when Elisha came into the house, look, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.

33. He went in therefore, and shut the door on both of them, and prayed to Yahweh.

34. And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.

35. Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

36. And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up your son.

37. Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.

38. And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his attendant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.

39. And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they did not know them.

40. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat of it.

41. But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.

42. And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.

43. And his minister said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, They will eat, and will have some left.

44. So he set it before them, and they ate, and had some left, according to the word of Yahweh.

## 2 Kings 5

1. Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.

2. And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife.

3. And she said to her mistress, Oh that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would recover him of his leprosy.

4. And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.

5. And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

6. And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter has come to you, look, I have sent Naaman my slave to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.

7. And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? But consider, I pray you{+}, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.

8. And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.

9. So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

10. And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will come again to you, and you will be clean.

11. But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Look, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.

12. Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.

13. And his slaves came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?

14. Then he went down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

15. And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Look now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a present of your slave.

16. But he said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

17. And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray you, let there be given to your slave two mules' burden of earth; for your slave will from now on offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.

18. In this thing Yahweh pardon your slave: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh pardon your slave in this thing.

19. And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.

20. But Gehazi the attendant of Elisha the man of God, said, Look, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

21. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he dismounted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?

22. And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Look, even now there have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.

23. And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them on two of his attendants; and they bore them before him.

24. And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.

25. But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where did you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your slave went no where.

26. And he said to him, Didn't my heart go [with you], when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and male slaves and female slaves?

27. The leprosy therefore of Naaman will stick to you, and to your seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.

## 2 Kings 6

1. And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Look now, the place where we dwell before you is too strait for us.

2. Let us go, we pray you, to the Jordan, and take from there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go{+}.

3. And one said, Be pleased, I pray you, to go with your slaves. And he answered, I will go.

4. So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.

5. But as one was felling a beam, the ax-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.

6. And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in there, and made the iron to swim.

7. And he said, Take it up to you. So he put out his hand, and took it.

8. Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his slaves, saying, In such and such a place will be my camp.

9. And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass such a place; for the Syrians are coming down there.

10. And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.

11. And the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled for this thing; and he called his slaves, and said to them, Will you{+} not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?

12. And one of his slaves said, No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.

13. And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Look, he is in Dothan.

14. Therefore he sent there horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and surrounded the city.

15. And when the minister of the man of God had risen early, and gone forth, look, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?

16. And he answered, Don't be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.

17. And Elisha prayed, and said, Yahweh, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And Yahweh opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, look, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

18. And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, Strike this people, I pray you, with blindness. And he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

19. And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you{+} to the man whom you{+} seek. And he led them to Samaria.

20. And it came to pass, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Yahweh, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and, look, they were in the midst of Samaria.

21. And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?

22. And he answered, You will not strike them: would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.

23. And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drank, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria did not come into the land of Israel anymore.

24. And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

25. And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, look, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for 80 [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five [pieces] of silver.

26. And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

27. And he said, If Yahweh does not help you, from where shall I help you? Out of the threshing-floor, or out of the wine press?

28. And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.

29. So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him; and she has hid her son.

30. And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked and saw that he had sackcloth inside on his flesh.

31. Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat will stand on him this day.

32. But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you{+} see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: isn't the sound of his master's feet behind him?

33. And while he was yet talking with them, look, the king came down to him: and he said, Look, this evil is of Yahweh; why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?

## 2 Kings 7

1. And Elisha said, Hear{+} the word of Yahweh: thus says Yahweh, Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour will be [sold] for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

2. Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Look, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Look, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.

3. Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why do we sit here until we die?

4. If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we will die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will but die.

5. And they rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, look, there was no man there.

6. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Look, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

7. Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

8. And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried from there also, and went and hid it.

9. Then they said one to another, We are not doing right; this day is a day of good news, and we hold our peace: if we tarry until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household.

10. So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, look, there was not a man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.

11. And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's household inside.

12. And the king arose in the night, and said to his slaves, I will now show you{+} what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we will take them alive, and get into the city.

13. And one of his slaves answered and said, Let some take, I pray you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in it, look, they are as all the multitude of Israel who are consumed; and let us send and see.

14. They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

15. And they went after them to the Jordan: and, look, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their hurry. And the messengers returned, and told the king.

16. And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Yahweh.

17. And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.

18. And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two seahs of barley will be for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;

19. and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, look, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Look, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it:

20. it came to pass even so to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.

## 2 Kings 8

1. Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go, you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for Yahweh has called for a famine; and it will also come upon the land seven years.

2. And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.

3. And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land.

4. Now the king was talking with Gehazi the attendant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things that Elisha has done.

5. And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that, look, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

6. And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.

7. And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and he was told, saying, The man of God has come here.

8. And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, Will I recover of this sickness?

9. So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Will I recover of this sickness?

10. And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You will surely recover; nevertheless Yahweh has shown me that he will surely die.

11. And he settled his countenance steadfastly [on him], until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.

12. And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel: their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will slay with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their pregnant women.

13. And Hazael said, But what is your slave, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria.

14. Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And he answered, He told me that you would surely recover.

15. And it came to pass on the next day, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

16. And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

17. He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

18. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.

19. Nevertheless Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David his slave's sake, as he promised him to give to him a lamp to his sons always.

20. In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.

21. Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites that surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.

22. So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.

23. And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

24. And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

25. In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.

26. Ahaziah was two and twenty years old, when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

27. And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.

28. And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.

29. And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

## 2 Kings 9

1. And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.

2. And when you come there, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber.

3. Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and don't tarry.

4. So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.

5. And when he came, look, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have a message for you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To you, O captain.

6. And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel.

7. And you will strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my slaves the prophets, and the blood of all the slaves of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.

8. For the whole house of Ahab will perish; and I will cut off from Ahab [every] one urinating against a wall, whether slave or free in Israel.

9. And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.

10. And the dogs will eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there will be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.

11. Then Jehu came forth to the slaves of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? Why did this insane fellow come to you? And he said to them, You{+} know the man and what his talk was.

12. And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king over Israel.

13. Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.

14. So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;

15. but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is in your{+} mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.

16. So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah came down to see Joram.

17. Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?

18. So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he didn't come back.

19. Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.

20. And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and didn't come back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.

21. And Joram said, Get ready. And they got his chariot ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

22. And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?

23. And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

24. And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.

25. Then [Jehu] said to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:

26. Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, says Yahweh; and I will requite you in this plot [of ground], says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him into the plot, according to the word of Yahweh.

27. But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Him too. Kill him. [This happened] in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.

28. And his slaves carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.

29. And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.

30. And when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.

31. And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, Zimri, your master's murderer?

32. And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three eunuchs looked out to him.

33. And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.

34. And when he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she's a king's daughter.

35. And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

36. Therefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his slave Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel will the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;

37. and the body of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they will not say, This is Jezebel.

## 2 Kings 10

1. Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters to the rulers of Samaria, to the elders of Jezreel, and to the tutors [appointed by] Ahab, saying,

2. And now as soon as this letter comes to you{+}, seeing your{+} master's sons are with you{+}, and there are with you{+} chariots and horses, and a fortified city, and armor;

3. look{+} for the best and meet of your{+} master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your{+} master's house.

4. But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Look, the two kings didn't stand before him: how then shall we stand?

5. And he who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up [the children], sent to Jehu, saying, We are your slaves, and will do all that you will bid us; we will not make any man king: do that which is good in your eyes.

6. Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you{+} are on my side, and if you{+} will listen to my voice, take{+} the heads of the men your{+} master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.

7. And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.

8. And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay{+} them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.

9. And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You{+} are righteous: look, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who struck all these?

10. Now know that nothing will fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his slave Elijah.

11. So Jehu struck all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and those who he knew well, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.

12. And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,

13. Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you{+}? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah: and we go down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen.

14. And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither did he leave any of them.

15. And when he had departed from there, he found Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.

16. And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh. So they made him ride in his chariot.

17. And when he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to Elijah.

18. And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.

19. Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice [to do] to Baal; whoever will be wanting, he will not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.

20. And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.

21. And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn't come. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.

22. And he said to him who was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.

23. And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, Search and look, in case there are here with you{+} any of the slaves of Yahweh, but only the worshipers of Baal themselves [should be here].

24. And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed himself eighty men outside, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your{+} hands escape, [he who lets him go], his life will be for the life of him.

25. And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the citadel of the house of Baal.

26. And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.

27. And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it an outside latrine, to this day.

28. Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

29. Nevertheless from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu didn't depart from after them, [to wit], the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.

30. And Yahweh said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, [and] have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Israel.

31. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin.

32. In those days Yahweh began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;

33. from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

34. Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

35. And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

36. And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.

## 2 Kings 11

1. Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.

2. But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, even him and his nurse [and put them] in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;

3. And he was hid with her in the house of Yahweh six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.

4. And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Yahweh; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh, and showed them the king's son.

5. And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you{+} will do: a third part of you{+}, that come in on the Sabbath, will be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

6. And a third part will be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so you{+} will keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.

7. And the two companies of you{+}, even all who go forth on the Sabbath, will keep the watch of the house of Yahweh about the king.

8. And you{+} will circle the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes inside the ranks, let him be slain: and be{+} with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.

9. And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

10. And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David's, which were in the house of Yahweh.

11. And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.

12. Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown on him, and [gave him] the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, [Long] live the king.

13. And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and of] the people, she came to the people into the house of Yahweh:

14. and she looked and saw that the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! Treason!

15. And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the host, and said to them, Bring her forth between the ranks; and slay him who follows her with the sword. For the priest said, Don't let her be slain in the house of Yahweh.

16. So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house: and there she was slain.

17. And Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh's people; between the king also and the people.

18. And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh.

19. And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Yahweh, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

20. So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And they had slain Athaliah with the sword at the king's house.

21. Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.

## 2 Kings 12

1. In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.

2. And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

3. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

4. And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Yahweh, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of Yahweh,

5. let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they will repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach will be found.

6. But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.

7. Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the [other] priests, and said to them, Why aren't you{+} repairing the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no [more] money from your{+} acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.

8. And the priests consented that they should take no [more] money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.

9. But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh: and the priests who kept the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh.

10. And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh.

11. And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Yahweh: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought on the house of Yahweh,

12. and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

13. But there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh;

14. for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired the house of Yahweh with it.

15. Moreover they didn't reckon with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.

16. The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Yahweh: it was the priests'.

17. Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

18. And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.

19. Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

20. And his slaves arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, [on the way] that goes down to Silla.

21. For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his slaves, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 13

1. In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] seventeen years.

2. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart therefrom.

3. And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.

4. And Jehoahaz implored Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.

5. (And Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the sons of Israel dwelt in their tents as formerly.

6. Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but they walked in them: and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)

7. For he did not leave to Jehoahaz of the people but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.

8. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

9. And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

10. In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] sixteen years.

11. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked in them.

12. Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

13. And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

14. Now Elisha had fallen sick of his sickness of which he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!

15. And Elisha said to him, Take a bow and arrows; and he took to himself a bow and arrows.

16. And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow; and he put his hand [on it]. And Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.

17. And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Yahweh's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you will strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.

18. And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike on the ground; and he struck three times, and stopped.

19. And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times: then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you will strike Syria but three times.

20. And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

21. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, look, they spied a band; and they hastily put the man into the tomb of Elisha. And they went [in], and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.

22. And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

23. But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he cast them from his presence as yet.

24. And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.

25. And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash struck him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

## 2 Kings 14

1. In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.

2. He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.

3. And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done.

4. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

5. And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his slaves who had slain the king his father:

6. but the sons of the murderers he did not put to death; according to that which is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, The fathers will not be put to death for the sons, nor the sons be put to death for the fathers; but every man will die for his own sin.

7. He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, to this day.

8. Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.

9. And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.

10. You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory of it, and remain at home; for why should you meddle to [your] hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?

11. But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.

12. And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.

13. And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

14. And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

15. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

16. And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.

17. And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.

18. Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

19. And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.

20. And they brought him on horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.

21. And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.

22. He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.

23. In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, [and reigned] forty and one years.

24. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

25. He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Yahweh, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his slave Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.

26. For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.

27. And Yahweh didn't say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

28. Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, [which had belonged] to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

29. And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 15

1. In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.

2. He was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

3. And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.

4. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

5. And Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land.

6. Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

7. And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

8. In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.

9. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as his fathers had done: he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

10. And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

11. Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, look, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

12. This was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu, saying, Your sons to the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Israel. And so it came to pass.

13. Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria.

14. And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

15. Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, look, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

16. Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and all who were in it, and its borders, from Tirzah: because they did not open to him, therefore he struck it; and all the women in it who were pregnant he ripped up.

17. In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, [and reigned] ten years in Samaria.

18. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

19. There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

20. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and didn't remain there in the land.

21. Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

22. And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.

23. In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] two years.

24. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

25. And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and struck him in Samaria, in the castle of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead.

26. Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, look, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

27. In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] twenty years.

28. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.

29. In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.

30. And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

31. Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, look, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

32. In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign.

33. He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.

34. And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

35. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh.

36. Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

37. In those days Yahweh began to send against Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

38. And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 16

1. In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

2. Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God, like David his father.

3. But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the disgusting behaviors of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the sons of Israel.

4. And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.

5. Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.

6. At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Edomites came to Elath, and dwelt there, to this day.

7. So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your slave and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.

8. And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

9. And the king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried [the people of] it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

10. And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all its workmanship.

11. And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it against the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus.

12. And when the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and offered on it.

13. And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, on the altar.

14. And the bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of his altar.

15. And King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king's burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the bronze altar will be for me to inquire by.

16. Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded.

17. And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.

18. And the covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside, he turned to the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Assyria.

19. Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

20. And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 17

1. In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, [and reigned] nine years.

2. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.

3. Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his slave, and brought him tribute.

4. And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

5. Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

6. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

7. And it was so, because the sons of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and had feared other gods;

8. and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the sons of Israel; and [walked in the statutes] which the kings of Israel made.

9. And the sons of Israel secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;

10. and they set themselves up pillars and Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree;

11. and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;

12. and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, You{+} will not do this thing.

13. Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn{+} from your{+} evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your{+} fathers, and which I sent to you{+} by my slaves the prophets.

14. Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn't believe in Yahweh their God.

15. And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and [went] after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Yahweh had charged them that they should not act like them.

16. And they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made themselves molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

17. And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and told the future and used magic, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.

18. Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.

19. Also Judah did not keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

20. And Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.

21. For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.

22. And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them;

23. until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his slaves the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.

24. And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the sons of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.

25. And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn't fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.

26. Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don't know the law of the god of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, look, they slay them, because they don't know the law of the god of the land.

27. Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you{+} brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.

28. So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.

29. Nevertheless every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.

30. And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

31. and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their sons in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

32. So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.

33. They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.

34. To this day they do after the former manner: they don't fear Yahweh, neither do they act after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Yahweh commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

35. with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You{+} will not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

36. but Yahweh, who brought you{+} up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him you{+} will fear, and to him you{+} will bow yourselves, and to him you{+} will sacrifice:

37. and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you{+}, you{+} will observe to do forevermore; and you{+} will not fear other gods:

38. and the covenant that I have made with you{+} you{+} will not forget; neither will you{+} fear other gods:

39. but Yahweh your{+} God you{+} will fear; and he will deliver you{+} out of the hand of all your{+} enemies.

40. Nevertheless they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.

41. So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their graven images; their sons likewise, and the sons of their sons, as did their fathers, so they do to this day.

## 2 Kings 18

1. Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.

2. He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.

3. And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.

4. He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for in those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.

5. He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor [among them] who were before him.

6. For he stuck to Yahweh; he did not depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses.

7. And Yahweh was with him; wherever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and did not serve him.

8. He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.

9. And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.

10. And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.

11. And the king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,

12. because they didn't obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.

13. Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.

14. And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

15. And Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house.

16. At that time Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and [from] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.

17. And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

18. And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

19. And Rabshakeh said to them, Say{+} now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?

20. You say (but they are but vain words), [There is] counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?

21. Now, look, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.

22. But if you{+} say to me, We trust in Yahweh our God; isn't that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You{+} will worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

23. Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.

24. How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's slaves, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

25. Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

26. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your slaves in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don't speak with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.

27. But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? [Has he] not [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own feces, and to drink their own urine with you{+}?

28. Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear{+} the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.

29. Thus says the king, Don't let Hezekiah deceive you{+}; for he will not be able to deliver you{+} out of his hand:

30. neither let Hezekiah make you{+} trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

31. Don't listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your{+} peace with me, and come out to me; and eat{+} every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink{+} every one the waters of his own cistern;

32. Until I come and take you{+} away to a land like your{+} own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that you{+} may live, and not die: and don't listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you{+}, saying, Yahweh will deliver us.

33. Have any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

34. Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

35. Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

36. But the people held their peace, and did not answer him a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, Don't answer him.

37. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

## 2 Kings 19

1. And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.

2. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

3. And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of disgrace; for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

4. It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard: therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant who is left.

5. So the slaves of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said to them, Thus you{+} will say to your{+} master, Thus says Yahweh, Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the attendants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

7. Look, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear [some] news, and will return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

8. So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.

9. And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Look, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus you{+} will speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11. Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them completely: and will you be delivered?

12. Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

13. Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.

15. And Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sits [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.

16. Incline your ear, O Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, O Yahweh, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent him to defy the living God.

17. Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations,

18. and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of man's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.

19. Now therefore, O Yahweh our God, save us, I urge you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you Yahweh are God alone.

20. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard [you].

21. This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.

22. Whom have you defied and blasphemed? And against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? [Even] against the Holy One of Israel.

23. By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, When I mount my chariot I will come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir-trees; and I will enter into its farthest lodging-place, its park forest.

24. I have dug and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.

25. Have you not heard how I had done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.

26. Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blighted before it is grown up.

27. I know your rising up, and your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.

28. Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.

29. And this will be the sign to you: You{+} will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year you{+} will sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

30. And the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

31. For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who will escape: the zeal of Yahweh will perform this.

32. Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.

33. By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city, says Yahweh.

34. For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my slave David's sake.

35. And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians: and when men arose early in the morning, look, these were all dead bodies.

36. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

37. And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 20

1. In those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order: for you will die, and not live.

2. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,

3. Remember now, O Yahweh, I urge you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept intensely.

4. And it came to pass, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,

5. Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people, Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: look, I will heal you; on the third day you will go up to the house of Yahweh.

6. And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my slave David's sake.

7. And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.

8. And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What will be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I will go up to the house of Yahweh the third day?

9. And Isaiah said, This will be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken: The shadow has gone forward ten steps. Shall it come back ten steps?

10. And Hezekiah answered, It is an easy thing for the shadow to decline ten steps, no, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.

11. And Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought back the shadow on the steps it had gone down, on the steps of Ahaz, backward ten steps.

12. At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

13. And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.

14. Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And from where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.

15. And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house they have seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.

16. And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh.

17. Look, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, will be carried to Babylon: nothing will be left, says Yahweh.

18. And of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, they will take away; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

19. Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth will be in my days?

20. Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

21. And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 21

1. Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hephzibah.

2. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the disgusting behaviors of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the sons of Israel.

3. For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.

4. And he built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, In Jerusalem I will put my name.

5. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.

6. And he made his son to pass through the fire, and interpreted omens, and used magic, and dealt with spiritists and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.

7. And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever;

8. neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my slave Moses commanded them.

9. But they didn't listen: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the sons of Israel.

10. And Yahweh spoke by his slaves the prophets, saying,

11. Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these disgusting things, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols;

12. therefore this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Look, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle.

13. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.

14. And I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

15. because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.

16. Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.

17. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

18. And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

19. Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

20. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father.

21. And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them:

22. and he forsook Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn't walk in the way of Yahweh.

23. And the slaves of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.

24. But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

25. Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

26. And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

## 2 Kings 22

1. Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.

2. And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his father, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

3. And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,

4. Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:

5. and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair the breaches of the house,

6. to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house.

7. Nevertheless there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.

8. And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Yahweh. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

9. And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your slaves have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.

10. And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered to me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

11. And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he rent his clothes.

12. And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's slave, saying,

13. Go{+}, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that was found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers haven't listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.

14. So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her.

15. And she said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Tell{+} the man who sent you{+} to me,

16. Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.

17. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.

18. But to the king of Judah, who sent you{+} to inquire of Yahweh, thus you{+} will say to him, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: As concerning the words which you have heard,

19. because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.

20. Therefore, look, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, neither will your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place. And they brought the king word again.

## 2 Kings 23

1. And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.

2. And the king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the house of Yahweh.

3. And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all [his] heart, and all [his] soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.

4. And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Beth-el.

5. And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; those also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.

6. And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people.

7. And he broke down the houses of the homosexuals, who were in the house of Yahweh, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.

8. And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.

9. Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.

10. And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.

11. And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Yahweh, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

12. And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, the king broke down, and beat [them] down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

13. And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the Mount of Olives, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the detestable thing of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the detestable thing of Moab, and for Milcom the disgusting thing of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled.

14. And he broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with man's bones.

15. Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.

16. And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh proclaimed by the man of God when Jeroboam stood at the feast on the altar. And he turned and lifted his eyes on the grave of the man of God who proclaimed these things.

17. Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Beth-el.

18. And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.

19. And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [Yahweh] to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.

20. And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned man's bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.

21. And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover to Yahweh your{+} God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.

22. Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

23. but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.

24. Moreover the spiritists, and the wizards, and the talismans, and the idols, and all the detestable things that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Yahweh.

25. And like him there was no king before him, that turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him did there arise any like him.

26. Notwithstanding, Yahweh did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him.

27. And Yahweh said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name will be there.

28. Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

29. In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and King Josiah went against him; and [Pharaoh-necoh] slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

30. And his slaves carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.

31. Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

32. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.

33. And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.

34. And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.

35. And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh-necoh.

36. Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

37. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.

## 2 Kings 24

1. In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his slave three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.

2. And Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the sons of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his slaves the prophets.

3. Surely at the commandment of Yahweh this came upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,

4. and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh would not pardon.

5. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

6. So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

7. And the king of Egypt didn't come again anymore out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

8. Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

9. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his father had done.

10. At that time the slaves of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

11. And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city, while his slaves were besieging it;

12. and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his slaves, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.

13. And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had said.

14. And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the blacksmiths; none remained, except the poorest sort of the people of the land.

15. And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.

16. And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the blacksmiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

17. And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, [Jehoiachin's] father's brother, king is his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

18. Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

19. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

20. For through the anger of Yahweh it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

## 2 Kings 25

1. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.

2. So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

3. On the ninth day of the [fourth] month the famine was intense in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.

4. Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war [fled] by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were against the city all around; and [the king] went by the way of the Arabah.

5. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.

6. Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.

7. And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

8. Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a slave of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.

9. And he burnt the house of Yahweh, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burnt with fire.

10. And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were [with] the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

11. And the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive.

12. But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

13. And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze of them to Babylon.

14. And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered, they took away.

15. And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.

16. The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.

17. The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of bronze: and like these had the second pillar with network.

18. And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:

19. and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, who were found in the city.

20. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

21. And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.

22. And as for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.

23. Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.

24. And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, Don't be afraid because of the slaves of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you{+}.

25. But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.

26. And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.

27. And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

28. and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,

29. and changed his prison garments. And [Jehoiachin] ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:

30. and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given to him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.
