## Numbers 5

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and everyone who has a discharge, and whoever is unclean by the dead:

3. both male and female you{+} will put out, outside the camp you{+} will put them; that they do not defile their camp, where I stay in their midst.

4. And the sons of Israel did so, and put them out outside the camp; as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.

5. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Speak to the sons of Israel, When a man or woman will commit any sin that man commits, so as to trespass against Yahweh, and that soul will be guilty;

7. then he will confess his sin which he has done: and he will make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty.

8. But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh will be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement will be made for him.

9. And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they present to the priest, will be his.

10. And every man's hallowed things will be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it will be his.

11. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

12. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife goes aside, and commits a trespass against him,

13. and a man has any sex with her, and it is hid from the eyes of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she is not taken in the act;

14. and the spirit of jealousy passed over him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy passed over him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled:

15. then the man will bring his wife to the priest, and will bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he will pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

16. And the priest will bring her near, and set her before Yahweh:

17. and the priest will take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest will take, and put it into the water.

18. And the priest will set the woman before Yahweh, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest will have in his hand the water of bitterness that causes the curse.

19. And the priest will cause her to swear, and will say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, [then] be innocent from this water of bitterness that causes the curse.

20. But if you have gone aside, being under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband:

21. then the priest will cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest will say to the woman, Yahweh will make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Yahweh makes your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;

22. and this water that causes the curse will go into your insides, and make your body to swell, and your thigh to fall away. And the woman will say, Amen, Amen.

23. And the priest will write these curses in a book, and he will blot them out into the water of bitterness:

24. and he will make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse will enter into her [and become] bitter.

25. And the priest will take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and will wave the meal-offering before Yahweh, and bring it to the altar:

26. and the priest will take a handful of the meal-offering, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, and afterward will make the woman drink the water.

27. And when he has made her drink the water, then it will come to pass, if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her [and become] bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away: and the woman will be a curse among her people.

28. And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she will be innocent, and will conceive seed.

29. This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes aside, and is defiled;

30. or when the spirit of jealousy passes over a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he will set the woman before Yahweh, and the priest will execute on her all this law.

31. And the man will be innocent from iniquity, and that woman will bear her iniquity.

## Numbers 6

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When either man or woman will make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to Yahweh,

3. he will separate himself from wine and strong drink; he will drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither will he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.

4. All the days of his separation he will eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the kernels even to the husk.

5. All the days of his vow of separation no razor will come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separates himself to Yahweh, he will be holy; he will let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.

6. All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he will not come near to a dead body.

7. He will not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation to God is on his head.

8. All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.

9. And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then he will shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day he will shave it.

10. And on the eighth day he will bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:

11. and the priest will offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and will hallow his head that same day.

12. And he will separate to Yahweh the days of his separation, and will bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days will be void, because his separation was defiled.

13. And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he will be brought to the door of the tent of meeting:

14. and he will offer his oblation to Yahweh, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,

15. and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.

16. And the priest will present them before Yahweh, and will offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:

17. and he will offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest will offer also the meal-offering of it, and the drink-offering of it.

18. And the Nazirite will shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and will take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.

19. And the priest will take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and will put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaven [the head of] his separation;

20. and the priest will wave them for a wave-offering before Yahweh; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.

21. This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, [and of] his oblation to Yahweh for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.

22. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you{+} will bless the sons of Israel: you{+} will say to them,

24. Yahweh bless you, and keep you:

25. Yahweh make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you:

26. Yahweh lift up his countenance on you, and give you peace.

27. So they will put my name on the sons of Israel; and I will bless them.

## Numbers 7

1. And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all its furniture, and the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed them and sanctified them;

2. that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are the ones who were over those who were numbered:

3. and they brought their oblation before Yahweh, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.

4. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

5. Take it of them, that they may be [used] in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and you will give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.

8. and four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

## Numbers 8

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and say to him, When you light the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in front of the lampstand.

3. And Aaron did so; he lit its lamps [so as to give light] in front of the lampstand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

4. And this was the work of the lampstand, [a] beaten work of gold; to its base, up to its flower, it was [a] beaten work: according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.

5. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and cleanse them.

7. And thus you will do to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation on them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.

8. Then let them take a young bull, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bull you will take for a sin-offering.

9. And you will present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and you will assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel:

10. and you will present the Levites before Yahweh. And the sons of Israel will lay their hands on the Levites:

11. and Aaron will offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the sons of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.

12. And the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the bullocks: and he [Aaron] will make of one of them a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.

13. And you will set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering to Yahweh.

14. Thus you will separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel; and the Levites will be mine.

15. And after that the Levites will go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and you will cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.

16. For they are wholly given to me from among the sons of Israel; instead of all that opens the womb, even the firstborn of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them to me.

17. For all the firstborn among the sons of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

18. And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel.

19. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the sons of Israel; that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel, when the sons of Israel come near to the sanctuary.

20. Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the Levites: according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the sons of Israel to them.

21. And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.

22. And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.

23. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

24. This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they will go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of meeting:

25. and from the age of fifty years they will cease waiting on the work, and will serve no more,

26. but will minister with their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and will do no service. Thus you will do to the Levites concerning their charges.

## Numbers 9

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

2. Moreover let the sons of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.

3. In the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you{+} will keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all its ordinances, you{+} will keep it.

4. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.

5. And they kept the Passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel.

6. And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

7. and those men said to him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Yahweh in its appointed season among the sons of Israel?

8. And Moses said to them, Wait{+}, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you{+}.

9. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If any man of you{+} or of your{+} generations will be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey far off, yet he will keep the Passover to Yahweh.

11. In the second month on the fourteenth day at evening they will keep it; they will eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:

12. they will leave none of it to the morning, nor break a bone of it: according to all the statute of the Passover they will keep it.

13. But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbears to keep the Passover, that soul will be cut off from his people; because he didn't offer the oblation of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man will bear his sin.

14. And if a stranger will sojourn among you{+}, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so he will do: you{+} will have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him who is born in the land.

15. And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at evening it was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.

16. So it always was: the cloud covered it and by night [had] the appearance of fire.

17. And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the sons of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud stayed, there the sons of Israel encamped.

18. At the commandment of Yahweh the sons of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped: as long as the cloud stayed on the tabernacle they remained encamped.

19. And when the cloud tarried on the tabernacle many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh, and didn't journey.

20. And sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they journeyed.

21. And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or [if it continued] by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

22. Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried on the tabernacle, staying on it, the sons of Israel remained encamped, and didn't journey; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

23. At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they journeyed: they kept the charge of Yahweh, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

## Numbers 10

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Make two trumpets of silver; of beaten work you will make them: and you will use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.

3. And when they will blow them, all the congregation will gather themselves to you at the door of the tent of meeting.

4. And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, will gather themselves to you.

5. And when you{+} blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side will take their journey.

6. And when you{+} blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side will take their journey: they will blow an alarm for their journeys.

7. But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you{+} will blow, but you{+} will not sound an alarm.

8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, will blow the trumpets; and they will be to you{+} for a statute forever throughout your{+} generations.

9. And when you{+} go to war in your{+} land against the adversary that oppresses you{+}, then you{+} will sound an alarm with the trumpets; and you{+} will be remembered before Yahweh your{+} God, and you{+} will be saved from your{+} enemies.

10. Also in the day of your{+} gladness, and in your{+} set feasts, and in the beginnings of your{+} months, you{+} will blow the trumpets over your{+} burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your{+} peace-offerings; and they will be to you{+} for a memorial before your{+} God: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

11. And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.

12. And the sons of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.

13. And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

14. And in the first [place] the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

15. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.

16. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.

17. And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, set forward.

18. And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

19. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

20. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

21. And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and [the others] had set up the tabernacle against their coming.

22. And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

23. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

24. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

25. And the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

26. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.

27. And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.

28. Thus were the journeyings of the sons of Israel according to their hosts; and they set forward.

29. And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, I will give it to you{+}: come with us, and we will do you good; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.

30. And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.

31. And he said, Don't leave us, I pray you; since you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you will be to us instead of eyes.

32. And it will be, if you go with us, yes, it will be, that whatever good Yahweh will do to us, the same we will do to you.

33. And they set forward from the mount of Yahweh three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.

34. And the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.

35. And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered; and let those who hate you flee before you.

36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.

## Numbers 11

1. And the people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Yahweh: and when Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Yahweh burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.

2. And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.

3. And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Yahweh burnt among them.

4. And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the sons of Israel also wept again, and said, Who will give us flesh to eat?

5. We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:

6. but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.

7. And the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance as the appearance of bdellium.

8. The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

9. And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.

10. And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.

11. And Moses said to Yahweh, Why have you dealt ill with your slave? And why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?

12. Have I become pregnant with all this people? Have I given birth to them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a foster-father carries the nursing child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?

13. From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

14. I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.

15. And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and don't let me see my wretchedness.

16. And Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you.

17. And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they will bear the burden of the people with you, that you yourself don't bear it alone.

18. And you say to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and you{+} will eat flesh; for you{+} have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Yahweh will give you{+} flesh, and you{+} will eat.

19. You{+} will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,

20. but a whole month, until it comes out at your{+} nostrils, and it is loathsome to you{+}; because you{+} have rejected Yahweh who is among you{+}, and have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

22. Will flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? Or will all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?

23. And Yahweh said to Moses, Is Yahweh's hand waxed short? Now you will see whether my word will come to pass to you or not.

24. And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.

25. And Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.

26. But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.

27. And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.

28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

29. And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh that all Yahweh's people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!

30. And Moses got himself into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

31. And a wind went forth from Yahweh, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.

32. And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he who gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.

33. While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.

34. And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.

35. From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they remained at Hazeroth.

## Numbers 12

1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.

2. And they said, Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us? And Yahweh heard it.

3. Now the man Moses was very meek, above all among man who were on the face of the earth.

4. And Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, You{+} three come out to the tent of meeting. And the three of them came out.

5. And Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.

6. And he said, Now hear my words: if there is a prophet among you{+}, I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.

7. My slave Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:

8. with him I will speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Yahweh he will see: why then were you{+} not afraid to speak against my slave, against Moses?

9. And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.

10. And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, look, Miriam was leprous, as [white as] snow: and Aaron looked on Miriam, and saw that she was leprous.

11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, don't lay, I pray you, sin on us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.

12. Don't let her, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.

13. And Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, Heal her, O God, I urge you.

14. And Yahweh said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she will be brought in again.

15. And Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days: and the people didn't journey until Miriam was brought in again.

16. And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.

## Numbers 13

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Send men for you, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers you{+} will send a man, every one a prince among them.

3. And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh: all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.

4. And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

5. Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

6. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

7. Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

8. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.

9. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

10. Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

11. Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

12. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

13. Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

14. Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

15. Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

16. These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.

17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, You{+} go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:

18. and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;

19. and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;

20. and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be{+} of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.

21. So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.

22. And they went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

23. And they came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

24. That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.

25. And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.

26. And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

27. And they told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.

28. Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the sons of Anak there.

29. Amalek dwells in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.

30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

31. But the men who went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

32. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.

33. And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

## Numbers 14

1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.

2. And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or that we had died in this wilderness!

3. And why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: Isn't it better for us to return into Egypt?

4. And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.

6. And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, rent their clothes:

7. and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.

8. If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.

9. Only don't rebel against Yahweh, neither be{+} afraid of the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us: don't fear them.

10. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.

11. And Yahweh said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?

12. I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.

13. And Moses said to Yahweh, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them;

14. and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are in the midst of this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.

15. Now if you will kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,

16. Because Yahweh wasn't able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.

17. And now, I pray you, let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,

18. Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means leave unpunished [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons, on the third and on the fourth generation.

19. Pardon, I pray you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving-kindness, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

20. And Yahweh said, I have pardoned according to your word:

21. but in very deed, as I live, and as the glory of Yahweh will fill all the earth;

22. because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tried me these ten times, and haven't listened to my voice;

23. surely they will not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither will any of those who despised me see it:

24. but my slave Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went; and his seed will possess it.

25. Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow you{+} turn, and you{+} get into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.

26. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

27. How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against me.

28. Say to them, As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you{+} have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you{+}:

29. your{+} dead bodies will fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you{+}, according to your{+} whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,

30. surely you{+} will not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make it so that you{+} stay in it, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

31. But your{+} little ones, that you{+} said should be a prey, them I will bring in, and they will know the land which you{+} have rejected.

32. But as for you{+}, your{+} dead bodies will fall in this wilderness.

33. And your{+} sons will be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and will bear your{+} prostitutions, until your{+} dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.

34. After the number of the days in which you{+} spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you{+} will bear your{+} iniquities, even forty years, and you{+} will know my alienation.

35. I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this I will do to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they will be consumed, and there they will die.

36. And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,

37. even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.

39. And Moses told these words to all the sons of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.

40. And they rose up early in the morning, and got up to the top of the mountain, saying, Look, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised: for we have sinned.

41. And Moses said, Why now do you{+} transgress the commandment of Yahweh, seeing it will not prosper?

42. Don't go up, for Yahweh is not among you{+}; that you{+} are not struck down before your{+} enemies.

43. For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you{+}, and you{+} will fall by the sword: because you{+} have turned back from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh will not be with you{+}.

44. But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and Moses, didn't depart out of the camp.

45. Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.

## Numbers 15

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} come into the land of your{+} habitations, which I give to you{+},

3. and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your{+} set feasts, to make a sweet savor to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock;

4. then he who offers his oblation will offer to Yahweh a meal-offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:

5. and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, you will prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.

6. Or for a ram, you will prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:

7. and for the drink-offering you will offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

8. And when you prepare a bull for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings to Yahweh;

9. then it will be offered with the bull a meal-offering of three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:

10. and you will offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

11. Thus it will be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the young goats.

12. According to the number that you{+} will prepare, so you{+} will do to every one according to their number.

13. All who are home-born will do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

14. And if a stranger sojourns with you{+}, or whoever may be among you{+} throughout your{+} generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh; as you{+} do, so he will do.

15. For the assembly, there will be one statute for you{+}, and for the stranger who sojourns [with you{+}], a statute forever throughout your{+} generations: as you{+} are, so will the sojourner be before Yahweh.

16. One law and one ordinance will be for you{+}, and for the stranger who sojourns with you{+}.

17. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} come into the land where I bring you{+},

19. then it will be, that, when you{+} eat of the bread of the land, you{+} will offer up a heave-offering to Yahweh.

20. Of the first of your{+} dough you{+} will offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so you{+} will heave it.

21. Of the first of your{+} dough you{+} will give to Yahweh a heave-offering throughout your{+} generations.

22. And when you{+} will err, and not observe all these commandments, which Yahweh has spoken to Moses,

23. even all that Yahweh has commanded you{+} by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment, and onward throughout your{+} generations;

24. then it will be, if it is done unintentionally, unknowingly of the congregation, that all the congregation will offer one young bull for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor to Yahweh, with the meal-offering of it, and the drink-offering of it, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.

25. And the priest will make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be forgiven; for it was unintentional, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin-offering before Yahweh, for their unintentional [error]:

26. and all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unintentionally.

27. And if one person sins unintentionally, then he will offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.

28. And the priest will make atonement for the soul who errs, when he sins unintentionally, before Yahweh, to make atonement for him; and he will be forgiven.

29. You{+} will have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is home-born among the sons of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.

30. But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemes Yahweh; and that soul will be cut off from among his people.

31. Because he has despised the word of Yahweh, and has broken his commandment, that soul will completely be cut off; his iniquity will be on him.

32. And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

33. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

34. And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.

35. And Yahweh said to Moses, The man will surely be put to death: all the congregation will stone him with stones outside the camp.

36. And all the congregation brought him outside the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

37. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

38. Speak to the sons of Israel, and bid them that they make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue:

39. and it will be to you{+} for a fringe, that you{+} may look at it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and do them; and that you{+} don't follow after your{+} own heart and your{+} own eyes, which you{+} prostitute after;

40. that you{+} may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your{+} God.

41. I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} out of the land of Egypt, to be your{+} God: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

## Numbers 16

1. Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:

2. and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;

3. and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You{+} take too much on yourselves, for everyone in the entire congregation is holy and Yahweh is among them: why then do you{+} lift up yourselves above the assembly of Yahweh?

4. And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face:

5. and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the morning Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he will choose he will cause to come near to him.

6. Do this: you{+} take censers, Korah, and all his company;

7. and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow: and it will be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he [will be] holy: you{+} take too much on yourselves, you{+} sons of Levi.

8. And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you{+} sons of Levi:

9. [does it seem but] a small thing to you{+}, that the God of Israel has separated you{+} from the congregation of Israel, to bring you{+} near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Yahweh, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;

10. and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And you{+} seek the priesthood also?

11. Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh: and Aaron, what is he that you{+} murmur against him?

12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:

13. is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but must you surely make yourself also a prince over us?

14. Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.

15. And Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, Don't respect their offering: I haven't taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.

16. And Moses said to Korah, You and all your company are to be before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:

17. and you{+} take every man his censer, and put incense on them, and you{+} bring before Yahweh every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.

18. And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.

20. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

22. And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?

23. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the congregation, saying, You{+} get up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

25. And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.

26. And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you{+}, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, or else you{+} will be consumed in all their sins.

27. So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.

28. And Moses said, Hereby you{+} will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.

29. If these die the common death of all of man, or if they be visited after the visitation of all of man; then Yahweh has not sent me.

30. But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you{+} will understand that these men have despised Yahweh.

31. And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them;

32. and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all of man who belonged to Korah, and all their goods.

33. So they, and all that belonged to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.

34. And all Israel who were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, If we don't, the earth will swallow us up.

35. And fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense.

36. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

37. Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he takes up the censers out of the burning, and you scatter the fire yonder; for they are holy,

38. even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made into beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they are holy; and they will be a sign to the sons of Israel.

39. And Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,

40. to be a memorial to the sons of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn incense before Yahweh; that he will not be as Korah, and as his company: as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.

41. But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You{+} have killed the people of Yahweh.

42. And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and saw that the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.

43. And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.

44. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

45. You{+} get up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them: for wrath has gone out from Yahweh; the plague has begun.

47. And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and saw that the plague had begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.

48. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.

49. Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.

50. And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stopped.

## Numbers 17

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: you will write every man's name on his rod.

3. And you will write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there will be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.

4. And you will lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you{+}.

5. And it will come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I will choose will bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against you{+}.

6. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

7. And Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.

8. And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and saw that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.

9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the sons of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

10. And Yahweh said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the sons of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they will not die.

11. Thus did Moses: as Yahweh commanded him, so he did.

12. And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Look, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.

13. Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Yahweh, dies: shall we perish all of us?

## Numbers 18

1. And Yahweh said to Aaron, You and your sons and your fathers' house with you will bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you will bear the iniquity of your{+} priesthood.

2. And your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, you bring near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you will be before the tent of the testimony.

3. And they will keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they will not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they will not die, neither they, nor you{+}.

4. And they will be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger will not come near to you{+}.

5. And you{+} will keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there will be no more wrath on the sons of Israel.

6. And I, look, I have taken your{+} brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel: to you{+} they are a gift, given to Yahweh, to do the service of the tent of meeting.

7. And you and your sons with you will keep your{+} priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that inside the veil; and you{+} will serve: I give you{+} the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger who comes near will be put to death.

8. And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, And I, look, I have given you the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel; to you I have given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever.

9. This will be yours of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they will render to me, will be most holy for you and for your sons.

10. As the most holy things you will eat of it; every male will eat of it: it will be holy to you.

11. And this is yours: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever; everyone who is clean in your house will eat of it.

12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh, to you I have given them.

13. The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, will be yours; everyone who is clean in your house will eat of it.

14. Everything devoted in Israel will be yours.

15. Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and beast will be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man you will surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean beasts you will redeem.

16. And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old you will redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).

17. But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you will not redeem; they are holy: you will sprinkle their blood on the altar, and will burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to Yahweh.

18. And the flesh of them will be yours, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it will be yours.

19. All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the sons of Israel offer to Yahweh, I have given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever: it is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to your seed with you.

20. And Yahweh said to Aaron, You will have no inheritance in their land, neither will you have any portion among them: I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.

21. And to the sons of Levi, look, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.

22. And from now on the sons of Israel will not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.

23. But the Levites will do the service of the tent of meeting, and they will bear their iniquity: it will be a statute forever throughout your{+} generations; and among the sons of Israel they will have no inheritance.

24. For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, Among the sons of Israel they will have no inheritance.

25. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Moreover you will speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you{+} take of the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you{+} from them for your{+} inheritance, then you{+} will offer up a heave-offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe.

27. And your{+} heave-offering will be reckoned to you{+}, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.

28. Thus you{+} also will offer a heave-offering to Yahweh of all your{+} tithes, which you{+} receive of the sons of Israel; and of it you{+} will give Yahweh's heave-offering to Aaron the priest.

29. Out of all your{+} gifts you{+} will offer every heave-offering of Yahweh, of all its best, even its hallowed part out of it.

30. Therefore you will say to them, When you{+} heave its best from it, then it will be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine press.

31. And you{+} will eat it in every place, you{+} and your{+} households: for it is your{+} reward in return for your{+} service in the tent of meeting.

32. And you{+} will bear no sin by reason of it, when you{+} have heaved from it the best of it: and you{+} will not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, that you{+} will not die.

## Numbers 19

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, [and] on which never came a yoke.

3. And you{+} will give her to Eleazar the priest, and he will bring her forth outside the camp, and one will slay her before his face:

4. and Eleazar the priest will take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.

5. And one will burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, he will burn:

6. and the priest will take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

7. Then the priest will wash his clothes, and he will bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he will come into the camp, and the priest will be unclean until the evening.

8. And he who burns her will wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and will be unclean until the evening.

9. And a man who is clean will gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place; and it will be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.

10. And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer will wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it will be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, for a statute forever.

11. He who touches any dead body of man will be unclean seven days:

12. the same will purify himself with it [the water] on the third day, and on the seventh day, and he will be clean: but if he does not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he will not be clean.

13. Whoever touches a dead person, the body of man who dies, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Yahweh; and that soul will be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he will be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.

14. This is the law when man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, will be unclean seven days.

15. And every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.

16. And whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of man, or a grave, will be unclean seven days.

17. And for the unclean they will take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water will be put thereto in a vessel:

18. and a clean person will take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:

19. and the clean person will sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he will purify him; and he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and will be clean at evening.

20. But the man who will be unclean, and will not purify himself, that soul will be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.

21. And it will be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity will wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity will be unclean until evening.

22. And whatever the unclean person touches will be unclean; and the soul who touches it will be unclean until evening.

## Numbers 20

1. And the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people remained in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

2. And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

3. And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Oh that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!

4. And why have you{+} brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?

5. And why have you{+} made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.

6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.

7. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

8. Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and you{+} speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you will bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you will give the congregation and their cattle to drink.

9. And Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him.

10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, you{+} rebels; shall we bring you{+} forth water out of this rock?

11. And Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.

12. And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, Because you{+} didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you{+} will not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.

13. These are the waters of Meribah; because the sons of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.

14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:

15. how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:

16. and when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, look, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.

17. Let us pass, I pray you, through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.

18. And Edom said to him, You will not pass through me, or else I will come out with the sword against you.

19. And the sons of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my cattle, then I will give its price: let me only, without [doing] anything [else], pass through on my feet.

20. And he said, You will not pass through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.

21. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: therefore Israel turned away from him.

22. And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to mount Hor.

23. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,

24. Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he will not enter into the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you{+} rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.

25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor;

26. and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron will be gathered [to his people], and will die there.

27. And Moses did as Yahweh commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

29. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

## Numbers 21

1. And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.

2. And Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will completely destroy their cities.

3. And Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they completely destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.

4. And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.

5. And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread.

6. And Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.

7. And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you; pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

8. And Yahweh said to Moses, You make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it will come to pass, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, will live.

9. And Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of bronze, he lived.

10. And the sons of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.

11. And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

12. From there they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.

13. From there they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

14. Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Yahweh, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,

15. And the slope of the valleys that inclines toward the dwelling of Ar, And leans on the border of Moab.

16. And from there [they journeyed] to Beer: that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

17. Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well; you{+} sing to it:

18. The well, which the princes dug, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the scepter, [and] with their poles. And from the wilderness [they journeyed] to Mattanah;

19. and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;

20. and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.

21. And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

22. Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border.

23. And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.

24. And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.

25. And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns.

26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.

27. Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, You{+} come to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:

28. For a fire has gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.

29. Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh: He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To Sihon king of the Amorites.

30. We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, And we have laid waste until the fire is kindled, which [reaches] to Medeba.

31. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and the Amorites who were there were driven out.

33. And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

34. And Yahweh said to Moses, Don't fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

35. So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was left him none remaining: and they possessed his land.

## Numbers 22

1. And the sons of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.

2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

3. And Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the sons of Israel.

4. And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now this multitude will lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.

5. And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the sons of Amav, to call him, saying, Look, there is a people come out from Egypt: see, they cover the face of the earth, and they dwell across from me.

6. Come now therefore, I pray you, curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I will prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.

7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of fortune-telling in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.

8. And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you{+} word again, as Yahweh will speak to me: and the princes of Moab remained with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?

10. And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, [saying],

11. Look, a people has come out of Egypt, which covers the face of the earth: now, come curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them, and will drive them out.

12. And God said to Balaam, You will not go with them; you will not curse the people; for they are blessed.

13. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, You{+} get into your{+} land; for Yahweh refuses to give me leave to go with you{+}.

14. And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.

15. And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.

16. And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming to me:

17. for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do: come therefore, I pray you, curse this people for me.

18. And Balaam answered and said to the slaves of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.

19. Now therefore, I pray you{+}, you{+} also tarry here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.

20. And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you will do.

21. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.

22. And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two attendants were with him.

23. And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.

24. Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

25. And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.

26. And the angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

27. And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.

28. And Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?

29. And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, If there were a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.

30. And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit to do so to you? And he said, No.

31. Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.

32. And the angel of Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Look, I have come forth for an adversary, because your way is precipitous before me:

33. and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely I would have even killed you by now, and saved her alive.

34. And Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get myself back again.

35. And the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I will speak to you, that you will speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

36. And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet him to Ar of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.

37. And Balak said to Balaam, Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Look, I have come to you: do I now have any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I will speak.

39. And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.

40. And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.

41. And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.

## Numbers 23

1. And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt-offering, and I will go: perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height.

4. And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.

5. And Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you will speak.

6. And he returned to him, and, look, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.

7. And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram has Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse Jacob for me, And come, defy Israel.

8. How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Yahweh has not defied?

9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I see him: look, it is a people who stays alone, And will not be reckoned among the nations.

10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and, look, you have blessed them altogether.

12. And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?

13. And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from where you may see them; you will see but the utmost part of them, and will not see them all: and curse them for me from there.

14. And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.

15. And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt-offering, while I meet [Yahweh] yonder.

16. And Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you will speak.

17. And he came to him, and saw that he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has Yahweh spoken?

18. And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Listen to me, you son of Zippor:

19. God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither a son of man, that he should repent: Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?

20. Look, I have received [commandment] to bless: And he has blessed, and I can't reverse it.

21. He has not seen iniquity in Jacob; Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: Yahweh his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.

22. God brings them forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox.

23. Surely there is no magic against Jacob; Neither is there any fortune-telling against Israel: Now it will be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God wrought!

24. Look, a people rises up as a lioness, And as a lion does he lift himself up: He will not lie down until he eats of the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain.

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.

26. But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Didn't I tell you, saying, All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.

28. And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.

## Numbers 24

1. And when Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he did not go, as at the other times, to use magic, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel staying according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.

3. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, And the [special] man whose eye was closed says;

4. He says, who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:

5. How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, Your tabernacles, O Israel!

6. As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the riverside, As lign-aloes which Yahweh has planted, As cedar-trees beside the waters.

7. Water will flow from his buckets, And his seed will be in many waters, And his king will be higher than Agag, And his kingdom will be exalted.

8. God brings him forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He will eat up the nations his adversaries, And will break their bones in pieces, And strike [them] through with his arrows.

9. He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a lioness; who will rouse him up? Blessed be everyone who blesses you, And cursed be everyone who curses you.

10. And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, look, you have altogether blessed them these three times.

11. Therefore now you flee to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, look, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Didn't I speak also to your messengers that you sent to me, saying,

13. If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that I will speak?

14. And now, look, I am going to my people: come, [and] I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.

15. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, And the [special] man whose eye was closed says;

16. He says, who hears words of God, And knows knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:

17. I see him, but not now; I look at him, but not near: There will come forth a star out of Jacob, And a scepter will rise out of Israel, And will strike through the corners of Moab, And the crown of the head of all the sons of tumult.

18. And Edom will be a possession, Seir also will be a possession, [who were] his enemies; While Israel does valiantly.

19. And out of Jacob will one have dominion, And will destroy the remnant from the city.

20. And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end will be to perish forever.

21. And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling-place, And your nest is set in the rock.

22. Nevertheless Kain will be wasted, Until Asshur will carry you away captive.

23. And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who will come in bands out of the north?

24. Those who go out from the coast of Kittim, And they will afflict Asshur, and will afflict Eber; And he also will perish forever.

25. And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.

## Numbers 25

1. And Israel dwelt in Shittim; and the people began to prostitute with the daughters of Moab:

2. for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.

3. And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel.

4. And Yahweh said to Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.

5. And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay every one of his men who have joined themselves to Baal-peor.

6. And, look, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.

7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;

8. and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped from the sons of Israel.

9. And those who died by the plague were twenty and four thousand.

10. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the sons of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the sons of Israel in my jealousy.

12. Therefore say, Look, I give to him my covenant of peace:

13. and it will be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the sons of Israel.

14. Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.

15. And the name of the Midianitish woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian.

16. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Vex the Midianites, and strike them;

18. for they vex you{+} with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you{+} in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.

## Numbers 26

1. And it came to pass after the plague, that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

2. Take the sum of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel.

3. And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

4. [Take the sum of the people], from twenty years old and upward; as Yahweh commanded Moses and the sons of Israel, that came forth out of the land of Egypt.

63. These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

64. But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

65. For Yahweh had said of them, They will surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of those, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

## Numbers 27

1. Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

2. And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,

3. Our father died in the wilderness, and he wasn't among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.

4. Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father.

5. And Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.

6. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you will surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you will cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

8. And you will speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a man dies, and has no son, then you{+} will cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.

9. And if he has no daughter, then you{+} will give his inheritance to his brothers.

10. And if he has no brothers, then you{+} will give his inheritance to his father's brothers.

11. And if his father has no brothers, then you{+} will give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he will possess it: and it will be to the sons of Israel a statute [and] ordinance, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

12. And Yahweh said to Moses, Get up into this mountain of Abarim, and look at the land which I have given to the sons of Israel.

13. And when you have seen it, you also will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered;

14. because you{+} rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)

15. And Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,

16. Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,

17. who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which have no shepherd.

18. And Yahweh said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;

19. and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

20. And you will put of your honor on him, that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey.

21. And he will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh: at his word they will go out, and at his word they will come in, both he, and all the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

22. And Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

23. and he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as Yahweh spoke by Moses.

## Numbers 28

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, and say to them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor to me, you{+} will observe to offer to me in their due season.

3. And you will say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you{+} will offer to Yahweh: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.

4. The one lamb you will offer in the morning, and the other lamb you will offer at evening;

5. and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.

6. It is a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

7. And the drink-offering of it will be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place you will pour out a drink-offering of strong drink to Yahweh.

8. And the other lamb you will offer at evening: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering of it, you will offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

9. And on the Sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering of it:

10. this is the burnt-offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering of it.

11. And in the beginnings of your{+} months you{+} will offer a burnt-offering to Yahweh: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;

12. and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;

13. and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering to every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

14. And their drink-offerings will be half a hin of wine for a bull, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.

15. And one he-goat for a sin-offering to Yahweh; it will be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering of it.

16. And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Yahweh's Passover.

17. And on the fifteenth day of this month will be a feast: seven days will unleavened bread be eaten.

18. In the first day will be a holy convocation: you{+} will do no servile work;

19. but you{+} will offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering to Yahweh: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they will be to you{+} without blemish;

20. and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts you{+} will offer for a bull, and two tenth parts for the ram;

21. a tenth part you will offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;

22. and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you{+}.

23. You{+} will offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.

24. After this manner you{+} will offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh: it will be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering of it.

25. And on the seventh day you{+} will have a holy convocation: you{+} will do no servile work.

26. Also in the day of the first fruits, when you{+} offer a new meal-offering to Yahweh in your{+} [feast of] weeks, you{+} will have a holy convocation; you{+} will do no servile work;

27. but you{+} will offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old;

28. and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,

29. a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;

30. one he-goat, to make atonement for you{+}.

31. Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering of it, you{+} will offer them (they will be to you{+} without blemish), and their drink-offerings.

## Numbers 29

1. And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you{+} will have a holy convocation; you{+} will do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you{+}.

7. And on the tenth day of this seventh month you{+} will have a holy convocation; and you{+} will afflict your{+} souls: you{+} will do no manner of work;

8. but you{+} will offer a burnt-offering to Yahweh for a sweet savor: one young bull, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they will be to you{+} without blemish;

9. and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,

40. And Moses told the sons of Israel according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses.

## Numbers 30

1. And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded.

2. When a man vows a vow to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he will not break his word; he will do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.

3. Also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,

4. and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows will stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul will stand.

5. But if her father disallows her in the day that he hears, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, will stand: and Yahweh will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.

6. And if she is [married] to a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul,

7. and her husband hears it, and holds his peace at her in the day that he hears it; then her vows will stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul will stand.

8. But if her husband disallows her in the day that he hears it, then he will make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul: and Yahweh will forgive her.

9. But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, [even] everything with which she has bound her soul, will stand against her.

10. And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,

11. and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and did not disallow her; then all her vows will stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul will stand.

12. But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, will not stand: her husband has made them void; and Yahweh will forgive her.

13. Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

14. But if her husband altogether holds his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.

15. But if he will make them null and void after he has heard them [and held his peace], then he will bear her iniquity.

16. These are the statutes, which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father's house.

## Numbers 31

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Avenge the sons of Israel of the Midianites: afterward you will be gathered to your people.

3. And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm{+} men from among you{+} for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh's vengeance on Midian.

4. Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you{+} will send to the war.

5. So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

6. And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.

7. And they warred against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses; and they slew every male.

8. And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

9. And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.

10. And all their cities in the places in which they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.

11. And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.

12. And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.

13. And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside the camp.

14. And Moses was angry with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.

15. And Moses said to them, Have you{+} saved all the women alive?

16. Look, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to produce disloyalty against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.

17. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has had any sex with a man.

18. But all the women-children, that haven't had any sex with a man, keep alive for yourselves.

19. And encamp{+} outside the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you{+} and your{+} captives.

20. And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood, you{+} will purify yourselves.

21. And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses:

22. nevertheless the gold, and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,

23. everything that may go into fire, you{+} will make to go through the fire, and it will be clean; nevertheless it will be purified with the water for impurity: and all that does not go into fire you{+} will make to go through the water.

24. And you{+} will wash your{+} clothes on the seventh day, and you{+} will be clean; and afterward you{+} will come into the camp.

25. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the congregation;

27. and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.

28. And levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred of man, and of the oxen, and of the donkeys, and of the flocks:

29. take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh's heave-offering.

30. And of the sons of Israel's half, you will take one drawn out of every fifty, of man, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, [even] of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Yahweh.

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.

32. Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,

33. and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,

34. and threescore and one thousand donkeys,

35. and souls of man, of the women that had not had any sex with a man, thirty and two thousand souls in all.

36. And the half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:

37. and Yahweh's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.

38. And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Yahweh's tribute was threescore and twelve.

39. And the donkeys were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Yahweh's tribute was threescore and one.

40. And the souls of man were sixteen thousand; of whom Yahweh's tribute was thirty and two souls.

41. And Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh's heave-offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

42. And of the sons of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from the men who warred

43. (now the congregation's half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,

44. and thirty and six thousand oxen,

45. and thirty thousand and five hundred donkeys,

46. and sixteen thousand souls of man),

47. even of the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

48. And the officers who were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses;

49. and they said to Moses, Your slaves have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.

50. And we have brought Yahweh's oblation, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, earrings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.

51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.

52. And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

53. ([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)

54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh.

## Numbers 32

1. Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, look, the place was a place for cattle;

2. the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,

3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and your slaves have cattle.

5. And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your slaves for a possession; don't bring us over the Jordan.

6. And Moses said to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, Will your{+} brothers go to the war, and will you{+} sit here?

7. And why do you{+} discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?

8. Thus did your{+} fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.

9. For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.

10. And Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,

11. Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, will see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

12. except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Yahweh.

13. And Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Yahweh, was consumed.

14. And, look, you{+} have risen up in your{+} fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.

15. For if you{+} turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you{+} will destroy all this people.

16. And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:

17. but we ourselves will go armed, hastily before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

18. We will not return to our houses, until the sons of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

19. For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.

20. And Moses said to them, If you{+} will do this thing, if you{+} will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,

21. and every armed man of you{+} will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,

22. and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you{+} will return, and be innocent toward Yahweh, and toward Israel; and this land will be to you{+} for a possession before Yahweh.

23. But if you{+} will not do so, look, you{+} have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your{+} sin will find you{+} out.

24. Build yourselves cities for your{+} little ones, and folds for your{+} sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your{+} mouth.

25. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your slaves will do as my lord commands.

26. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, will be there in the cities of Gilead;

27. but your slaves will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.

28. So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

29. And Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass with you{+} over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land will be subdued before you{+}; then you{+} will give them the land of Gilead for a possession:

30. but if they will not pass over with you{+} armed, they will have possessions among you{+} in the land of Canaan.

31. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As Yahweh has said to your slaves, so we will do.

32. We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance [will remain] with us beyond the Jordan.

33. And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities with [their] borders, even the cities of the land round about.

34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

35. and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,

36. and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.

37. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

38. and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the cities which they built.

39. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and the Amorites who were in it were dispossessed.

40. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth-jair.

42. And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

## Numbers 33

1. These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

2. And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Yahweh: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.

3. And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the sons of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,

4. while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom Yahweh had struck among them: on their gods also Yahweh executed judgments.

24. And they journeyed from mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.

25. And they journeyed from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.

26. And they journeyed from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.

27. And they journeyed from Tahath, and encamped in Terah.

28. And they journeyed from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah.

29. And they journeyed from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah.

30. And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.

31. And they journeyed from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene-jaakan.

32. And they journeyed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped in Hor-haggidgad.

33. And they journeyed from Hor-haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.

34. And they journeyed from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.

35. And they journeyed from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion-geber.

36. And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and encamped in the wilderness of Zin (the same is Kadesh).

37. And they journeyed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.

38. And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.

39. And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.

40. And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the sons of Israel.

41. And they journeyed from mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.

42. And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.

43. And they journeyed from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.

44. And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped in Iye-abarim, in the border of Moab.

45. And they journeyed from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon-gad.

46. And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim.

47. And they journeyed from Almon-diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

48. And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

49. And they encamped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even to Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.

50. And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

51. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

52. then you{+} will drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you{+}, and destroy all their figured [stones], and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:

53. and you{+} will take possession of the land, and dwell in it; for to you{+} I have given the land to possess it.

54. And you{+} will inherit the land by lot according to your{+} families; to the more you{+} will give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you will give the less inheritance: wherever the lot falls to any man, that will be his; according to the tribes of your{+} fathers you{+} will inherit.

55. But if you{+} will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you{+}, then will those who you{+} let remain of them be as pricks in your{+} eyes, and as thorns in your{+} sides, and they will vex you{+} in the land in which you{+} dwell.

56. And it will come to pass, that, as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you{+}.

## Numbers 34

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that will fall to you{+} for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders),

3. then your{+} south quarter will be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your{+} south border will be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;

4. and your{+} border will turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out of it will be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it will go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;

5. and the border will turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and the goings out of it will be at the sea.

6. And for the western border, you{+} will have the great sea and the neighboring area: this will be your{+} west border.

7. And this will be your{+} north border: from the great sea you{+} will mark out for you{+} mount Hor;

8. from mount Hor you{+} will mark out to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border will be at Zedad;

9. and the border will go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it will be at Hazar-enan: this will be your{+} north border.

10. And you{+} will mark out your{+} east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham;

11. and the border will go down from Shepham [to] Harbelah, on the east side of Ain; and the border will go down, and will reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;

12. and the border will go down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it will be at the Salt Sea. This will be your{+} land according to its borders round about.

13. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, This is the land which you{+} will inherit by lot, which Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;

14. for the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:

15. the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.

16. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

17. These are the names of the men who will divide the land to you{+} for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

18. And you{+} will take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.

19. And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

20. And of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.

21. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

22. And of the tribe of the sons of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli.

23. Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

24. And of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.

25. And of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

26. And of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.

27. And of the tribe of the sons of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.

28. And of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

29. These are those whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.

## Numbers 35

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them you{+} will give to the Levites.

3. And the cities they will have to dwell in; and their suburbs will be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.

4. And the suburbs of the cities, which you{+} will give to the Levites, will be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.

5. And you{+} will measure outside the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This will be to them the suburbs of the cities.

6. And the cities which you{+} will give to the Levites, they will be the six cities of refuge, which you{+} will give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you{+} will give forty and two cities.

7. All the cities which you{+} will give to the Levites will be forty and eight cities; them [you{+} will give] with their suburbs.

8. And concerning the cities which you{+} will give of the possession of the sons of Israel, from the many you{+} will take many; and from the few you{+} will take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inherits will give of his cities to the Levites.

9. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

11. then you{+} will appoint yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you{+}, that the manslayer that kills any person unintentionally may flee there.

12. And the cities will be to you{+} for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer will not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment.

13. And the cities which you{+} will give will be for you{+} six cities of refuge.

14. You{+} will give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities you{+} will give in the land of Canaan; they will be cities of refuge.

15. For the sons of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, will these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unintentionally may flee there.

16. But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.

17. And if he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.

18. Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.

19. The avenger of blood will himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he will put him to death.

20. And if he thrusts him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,

21. or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him will surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood will put the murderer to death, when he meets him.

22. But if he thrusts him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait,

23. or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he wasn't his enemy, neither sought his harm;

24. then the congregation will judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;

25. and the congregation will deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation will restore him to his city of refuge, where he has fled: and he will dwell in it until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.

26. But if the manslayer will at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,

27. and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slays the manslayer; he will not be guilty of blood,

28. because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer will return into the land of his possession.

29. And these things will be for a statute [and] ordinance to you{+} throughout your{+} generations in all your{+} dwellings.

30. Whoever kills any person, the murderer will be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness will not testify against any person that he die.

31. Moreover you{+} will take no ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death; but he will surely be put to death.

32. And you{+} will take no ransom for someone to flee to his city of refuge, to come back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.

33. So you{+} will not pollute the land in which you{+} are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.

34. And you will not defile the land which you{+} inhabit, in the midst of which I stay: for I, Yahweh, stay in the midst of the sons of Israel.

## Numbers 36

1. And the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the sons of Israel:

2. and they said, Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

3. And if they are married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they will belong: so it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.

4. And when it will be the jubilee of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they will belong: so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

5. And Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of Yahweh, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.

6. This is the thing which Yahweh commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; they will be married only into the family of the tribe of their father.

7. So no inheritance of the sons of Israel will remove from tribe to tribe; for the sons of Israel will stick every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

8. And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel, will be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the sons of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.

9. So no inheritance will remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the sons of Israel will stick every one to his own inheritance.

10. Even as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:

11. for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.

12. They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.

13. These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
