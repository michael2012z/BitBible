# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you{+} and peace.

2. We give thanks to God always for all of you{+}, making mention [of you{+}] in our prayers without ceasing,

3. remembering your{+} work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;

4. knowing, brothers beloved by God, your{+} election,

5. how that our good news did not come to you{+} in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as you{+} know what manner of men we showed ourselves among you{+} for your{+} sake.

6. And you{+} became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;

7. so that you{+} became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.

8. For from you{+} has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your{+} faith toward God has gone forth; so that we don't need to speak anything.

9. For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had to you{+}; and how you{+} turned to God from idols, to serve as slaves to a living and true God,

10. and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.

## 1 Thessalonians 2

1. For yourselves, brothers, know our entering in to you{+}, that it has not been found vain:

2. but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you{+} know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak to you{+} the good news of God in much conflict.

3. For our exhortation [is] not of error, nor of impurity, nor in guile:

4. but even as we have been approved of God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proves our hearts.

5. For neither at any time did we come in words of flattery, as you{+} know, nor in a cloak of greed, God is witness;

6. nor seeking glory of men, neither from you{+} nor from others.

7. We could have been a burden as apostles of Christ. But we became juveniles among you{+}, as when a nurse cherishes her own children:

8. even so, being affectionately desirous of you{+}, we were well pleased to impart to you{+}, not the good news of God only, but also our own souls, because you{+} became very dear to us.

9. For you{+} remember, brothers, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you{+}, we preached to you{+} the good news of God.

10. You{+} are witnesses, and God [also], how holily and righteously and unblamably we became toward you{+} who believe:

11. as you{+} know how we [dealt with] each one of you{+}, as a father with his own children,

12. exhorting you{+}, and encouraging, and testifying, to the end that you{+} should walk worthily of God, who calls you{+} into his own kingdom and glory.

13. And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you{+} received from us the word of the message, [even the word] of God, you{+} accepted [it] not [as] the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you{+} who believe.

14. For you{+}, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: for you{+} also suffered the same things of your{+} own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;

15. who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and did not please God, and are contrary to all men;

16. forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.

17. But we, brothers, being bereaved of you{+} for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your{+} face with great desire:

18. because we wanted to come to you{+}, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.

19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you{+}, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?

20. For you{+} are our glory and our joy.

## 1 Thessalonians 3

1. Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;

2. and sent Timothy, our brother and coworker under God in the good news of Christ, to establish you{+}, and to comfort [you{+}] concerning your{+} faith;

3. that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.

4. For truly, when we were with you{+}, we told you{+} beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and you{+} know.

5. For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your{+} faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you{+}, and our labor should be in vain.

6. But when Timothy came even now to us from you{+}, and brought us good news about your{+} faith and love, and that you{+} have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also [to see] you{+};

7. for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you{+} in all our distress and affliction through your{+} faith:

8. for now we live, if you{+} stand fast in the Lord.

9. For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you{+}, for all the joy with which we joy for your{+} sakes before our God;

10. night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your{+} face, and may provide that which is lacking in your{+} faith?

11. Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you{+}:

12. and the Lord make you{+} to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also [do] toward you{+};

13. to the end he may establish your{+} hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. Amen.

## 1 Thessalonians 4

1. Finally then, brothers, we urge and exhort you{+} in the Lord Jesus, that, as you{+} received of us how you{+} ought to walk and to please God, even as you{+} do walk, --that you{+} abound more and more.

2. For you{+} know what charge we gave you{+} through the Lord Jesus.

3. For this is the will of God, [even] your{+} sanctification, that you{+} abstain from fornication;

4. that each of you{+} know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,

5. not by immoral sexual passion, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;

6. that no man transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you{+} and testified.

7. For God called us not for impurity, but in sanctification.

8. Therefore he who rejects, rejects not man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you{+}.

9. But concerning love of the brothers you{+} have no need that one write to you{+}: for you{+} yourselves are taught of God to love one another;

10. for indeed you{+} do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you{+}, brothers, that you{+} abound more and more;

11. and that you{+} make it your aim to be quiet, and to participate in your{+} own [things], and to work with your{+} own hands, even as we charged you{+};

12. that you{+} may walk becomingly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.

13. But we would not have you{+} ignorant, brothers, concerning those who fall asleep; that you{+} do not sorrow, even as the rest, who have no hope.

14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so those also that have fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

15. For this we say to you{+} by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.

16. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first;

17. then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

18. Therefore comfort one another with these words.

## 1 Thessalonians 5

1. But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you{+} have no need that anything be written to you{+}.

2. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.

3. When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.

4. But you{+}, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you{+} as a thief:

5. for you{+} are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;

6. so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.

7. For those who sleep, sleep in the night: and those who are drunk, are drunk in the night.

8. But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.

9. For God did not appoint us into wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

10. who died for us, that, whether we are awake or asleep, we should live together with him.

11. Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also you{+} do.

12. But we urge you{+}, brothers, to know those who labor among you{+}, and are over you{+} in the Lord, and admonish you{+};

13. and to esteem them exceedingly highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

14. And we exhort you{+}, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all.

15. See that none render to anyone evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, both one toward another, and toward all.

16. Rejoice always;

17. pray without ceasing;

18. in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you{+}.

19. Do not quench the Spirit;

20. do not despise prophesyings;

21. but prove all things; hold fast that which is good;

22. abstain from every form of evil.

23. And may the God of peace himself sanctify you{+} wholly; and may your{+} spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

24. Faithful is he who calls you{+}, who will also do it.

25. Brothers, pray also for us.

26. Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

27. I adjure you{+} by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers.

28. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you{+}.
