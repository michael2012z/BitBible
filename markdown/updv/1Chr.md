25. And they trespassed against the God of their fathers, and prostituted after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God destroyed before them.

26.

## 1 Chronicles 9

1. So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, look, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel: and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their transgression.

2. Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and those given [to temple service].

3. And in Jerusalem dwelt of the sons of Judah, and of the sons of Benjamin, and of the sons of Ephraim and Manasseh:

4. Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the sons of Perez the son of Judah.

17. And the porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief),

18. who until now [waited] in the king's gate eastward: they were the porters for the camp of the sons of Levi.

19. And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father's house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent: and their fathers had been over the camp of Yahweh, keepers of the entry.

20. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was leader over them in time past, [and] Yahweh was with him.

21. Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tent of meeting.

22. All these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer appointed in their office of trust.

23. So they and their sons had the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh, even the house of the tent, by wards.

24. On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.

25. And their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:

26. for the four leading porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the chambers and over the treasuries in the house of God.

27. And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge [of it] was on them; and to them pertained the opening of it morning by morning.

28. And certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by count these were brought in and by count these were taken out.

29. Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

30. And some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices.

31. And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust over the things that were baked in pans.

32. And some of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the showbread, to prepare it every Sabbath.

33. And these are the singers, heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites, [who dwelt] in the chambers [and were] free [from other service]; for they were employed in their work day and night.

34. These were heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men: these dwelt at Jerusalem.

35. And in Gibeon there dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's name was Maacah:

## 1 Chronicles 10

1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

2. And the Philistines stuck [closely] after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

3. And the battle went intensely against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.

4. Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, or else these uncircumcised will come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.

5. And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.

6. So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.

7. And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

8. And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

9. And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the good news to their idols, and to the people.

10. And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.

11. And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

12. all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

13. So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of the word of Yahweh, which he did not keep; and also for asking counsel of a spiritist, to inquire,

14. and did not inquire of Yahweh: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.

## 1 Chronicles 11

1. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Look, we are your bone and your flesh.

2. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh your God said to you, You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be leader over my people Israel.

3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Yahweh by Samuel.

4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.

5. And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You will not come in here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.

6. And David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first will be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.

7. And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.

8. And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

9. And David waxed greater and greater; for Yahweh of hosts was with him.

10. Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel.

11. And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jishbaal, the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the elite troops; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.

12. And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.

13. He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

14. And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.

15. And three [the elite] of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

16. And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.

17. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!

18. And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,

19. and said, My God forbid it of me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy? For with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.

20. And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.

21. Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: nevertheless he didn't attain to the three.

22. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a man of valor of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.

23. And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

24. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.

25. Look, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain to the three: and David set him over his guard.

26. Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,

27. Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

28. Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,

29. Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

30. Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,

31. Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

32. Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

33. Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

34. the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,

35. Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

36. Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

37. Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

38. Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,

40. Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

41. Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

42. Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,

43. Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

44. Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,

45. Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

46. Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

47. Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.

## 1 Chronicles 12

1. Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in war.

2. They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.

3. The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,

4. and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite,

5. Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,

6. Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,

7. and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

8. And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes on the mountains;

9. Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

10. Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

11. Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

12. Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

13. Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.

14. These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host: he who was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand.

15. These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.

16. And there came of the sons of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.

17. And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you{+} have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be knit to you{+}; but if [you{+} have come] to betray me to my adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look on it, and rebuke it.

18. Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the elite troops, [and he said], We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.

19. Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they didn't help them; for the lords of the Philistines on advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.

20. As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.

21. And they helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.

22. For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.

23. And these are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Yahweh.

24. The sons of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.

25. Of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.

26. Of the sons of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

27. And Jehoiada was the leader of [the house of] Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred,

28. and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.

29. And of the sons of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand: for until now the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.

30. And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' houses.

31. And of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.

32. And of the sons of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their commandment.

33. Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and that could order [the battle array, and were] not of double heart.

34. And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.

35. And of the Danites that could set the battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.

36. And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand.

37. And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.

38. All these being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.

39. And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had prepared for them.

40. Moreover those who were near to them, [even] as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victuals of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.

## 1 Chronicles 13

1. And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.

2. And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you{+}, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad every where to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;

3. and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we did not seek to it in the days of Saul.

4. And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

5. So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor [the brook] of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.

6. And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, [that is], to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, who is called by the name: Yahweh who sits [above] the cherubim.

7. And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, [and brought it] out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.

8. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

9. And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

10. And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.

11. And David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza, to this day.

12. And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?

13. So David didn't remove the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

14. And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

## 1 Chronicles 14

1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.

2. And David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.

3. And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begot more sons and daughters.

4. And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

5. and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,

6. and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

7. and Elishama, and Baaliada, and Eliphelet.

8. And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.

9. Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.

10. And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will you deliver them into my hand? And Yahweh said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.

11. So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

12. And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.

13. And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.

14. And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You will not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them across from the mulberry-trees.

15. And it will be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then you will go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the host of the Philistines.

16. And David did as God commanded him: and they struck the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

17. And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. And [David] made houses for himself in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.

2. Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.

3. And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for it.

4. And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:

5. of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers a hundred and twenty;

6. of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred and twenty;

7. of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers a hundred and thirty;

8. of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;

9. of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;

10. of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers a hundred and twelve.

11. And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

12. and said to them, You{+} are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both you{+} and your{+} brothers, that you{+} may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to [the place] that I have prepared for it.

13. For because you{+} did not [bear it] at the first, Yahweh our God made a breach on us, for we did not seek him according to the ordinance.

14. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.

15. And the sons of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles on them, as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh.

16. And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.

17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

18. and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, son, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.

19. So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed] with cymbals of bronze to sound aloud;

20. and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth;

21. and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.

22. And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.

23. And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

24. And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

25. So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.

26. And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.

27. And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song [with] the singers: and David had on him an ephod of linen.

28. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.

29. And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw King David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.

2. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.

3. And he dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.

4. And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:

5. Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;

6. and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.

7. Then on that day David first appointed to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.

8. O give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.

9. Sing to him, sing praises to him; Talk{+} of all his marvelous works.

10. Glory{+} in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Yahweh.

11. Seek{+} Yahweh and his strength; Seek his face evermore.

12. Remember his marvelous works that he has done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

13. O you{+} seed of Israel his slave, You{+} sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.

14. He is Yahweh our God; His judgments are in all the earth.

15. Remember his covenant forever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

16. [The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath to Isaac,

17. And confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,

18. Saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, The lot of your{+} inheritance;

19. When you{+} were but a few men in number, Yes, very few, and sojourners in it;

20. And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.

21. He allowed no man to do them wrong; Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,

22. [Saying], Don't touch my anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.

23. Sing to Yahweh, all the earth; Proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.

24. Declare his glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples.

25. For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be awed above all gods.

26. For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Yahweh made the heavens.

27. Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.

28. Ascribe to Yahweh, you{+} kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength;

29. Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Yahweh in holy array.

30. Tremble before him, all the earth: Indeed, the world will be established, it will not be moved.

31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Yahweh reigns.

32. Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it; Let the field exult, and all that is in it;

33. Then will the trees of the forest sing for joy before Yahweh; For he comes to judge the earth.

34. O give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

35. And say{+}, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to your holy name, And to triumph in your praise.

36. Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Yahweh.

37. So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;

38. and Obed-edom with their brothers, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;

39. and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon,

40. to offer burnt-offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded to Israel;

41. and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving-kindness [endures] forever;

42. and with them Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud, and [with] instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.

43. And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Look, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh [dwells] under curtains.

2. And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.

3. And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

4. Go and tell David my slave, Thus says Yahweh, You will not build me a house to dwell in:

5. for I haven't dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].

6. In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why haven't you{+} built me a house of cedar?

7. Now therefore thus you will say to my slave David, Thus says Yahweh of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that you should be leader over my people Israel:

8. and I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.

9. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may stay in their own place, and be moved no more; neither will the sons of wickedness waste them anymore, as at the first,

10. and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.

11. And it will come to pass, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

12. He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.

13. I will be his father, and he will be my son: and I will not take my loving-kindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you;

14. but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever; and his throne will be established forever.

15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.

16. Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, O Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?

17. And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; but you have spoken of your slave's house for a great while to come, and you see me according to the rank of man placed high, O Yahweh God.

18. What can David [say] yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your slave? For you know your slave.

19. O Yahweh, for your slave's sake, and according to your own heart, you have wrought all this greatness, to make known all [these] great things.

20. O Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

21. And what other nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make yourself a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed out of Egypt?

22. For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.

23. And now, O Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your slave, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.

24. And let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David your slave is established before you.

25. For you, O my God, have revealed to your slave that you will build him a house: therefore your slave has found [in his heart] to pray before you.

26. And now, O Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your slave:

27. and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your slave, that it may continue forever before you: for you, O Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.

## 1 Chronicles 18

1. And after this it came to pass, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

2. And he struck Moab; and the Moabites became slaves to David, and brought tribute.

3. And David struck Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.

5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

6. Then David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became slaves to David, and brought tribute. And Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

7. And David took the shields of gold that were on the slaves of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

8. And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.

9. And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,

10. he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and struck him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and [he had with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and bronze.

11. These also King David dedicated to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

12. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.

13. And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became slaves to David. And Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

14. And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people.

15. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;

16. and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

17. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.

## 1 Chronicles 19

1. And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

2. And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's slaves came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

3. But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven't his slaves come to you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

4. So Hanun took David's slaves, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

5. Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your{+} beards are grown, and then return.

6. And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire themselves chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.

7. So they hired themselves thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

8. And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.

9. And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.

10. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.

11. And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the sons of Ammon.

12. And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you will help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.

13. Be strong and we will be strengthened for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh will do that which is good in his eyes.

14. So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.

15. And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

16. And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.

17. And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

18. And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

19. And when the slaves of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the sons of Ammon anymore.

## 1 Chronicles 20

1. And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out [to battle], that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.

2. And David took the crown of Milcom from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceedingly much.

3. And he brought forth the people who were in it. And he put [them to work] with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

4. And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.

5. And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

6. And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six [on each hand], and six [on each foot]; and he also was born to the giant.

7. And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.

8. These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his slaves.

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.

2. And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.

3. And Joab said, Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's slaves? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?

4. Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

5. And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all those of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men who drew sword: and Judah was 470,000 men who drew sword.

6. But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them; for the king's word was disgusting to Joab.

7. And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.

8. And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I urge you, the iniquity of your slave; for I have done very foolishly.

9. And Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,

10. Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose for yourself one of them, that I may do it to you.

11. So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take which you will:

12. either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I will return to him who sent me.

13. And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies: and don't let me fall into the hand of man.

14. So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

15. And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh looked, and he repented of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now let down your hand. And the angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

16. And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.

17. And David said to God, Is it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand, I pray you, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.

18. Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar to Yahweh in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

19. And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.

20. And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

21. And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.

22. Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build on it an altar to Yahweh: for the full price you will give it to me, that the plague may be stopped from the people.

23. And Ornan said to David, Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: look, I give [you] the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.

24. And King David said to Ornan, No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.

25. So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.

26. And David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt-offering.

27. And Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.

28. At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.

30. But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. Then David said, This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.

2. And David commanded to gather together the sojourners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut wrought stones to build the house of God.

3. And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and bronze in abundance without weight;

4. and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and those of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.

5. And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

6. Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.

7. And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.

8. But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you will not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.

9. Look, a son will be born to you, who will be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days:

10. he will build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.

11. Now, my son, Yahweh be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.

12. Only may Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.

13. Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.

14. Now, look, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone I have prepared; and you may add thereto.

15. Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men who are skillful in every manner of work:

16. of the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and do it, and Yahweh be with you.

17. David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, [saying],

18. Isn't Yahweh your{+} God with you{+}? And has he not given you{+} rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.

19. Now set your{+} heart and your{+} soul to seek after Yahweh your{+} God; arise therefore, and build{+} the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh.

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

2. And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

3. And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, the [able-bodied] men, was thirty and eight thousand.

4. Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; and six thousand were officers and judges;

5. and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, [said David], to praise using them.

6. And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

7. Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.

8. The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.

9. The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' [houses] of Ladan.

10. And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

11. And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning.

12. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.

14. But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

16. The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.

17. And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

18. The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.

19. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

20. The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.

21. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

22. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them [as wife].

23. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

24. These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the ones of those who were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and upward.

25. For David said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he stays in Jerusalem forever:

26. and also the Levites will no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for its service.

27. For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.

28. For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;

29. for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;

30. and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise at evening;

31. and to offer all burnt-offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;

32. and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the house of Yahweh.

## 1 Chronicles 24

1. And the courses of the sons of Aaron [were these]. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

2. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no sons: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.

3. And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.

4. And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and [thus] they were divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers' houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers' houses, eight.

5. Thus they were divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

6. And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken, one taken for Ithamar.

7. Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

8. the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

9. the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

10. the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

11. the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,

12. the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

13. the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

14. the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

15. the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,

16. the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,

17. the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,

18. the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.

19. This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance [given] to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him.

20. And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

21. Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.

22. Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.

23. And the sons of [Hebron]: Jeriah [the chief], Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

24. The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.

25. The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.

26. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.

27. The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.

28. Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.

29. Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.

30. And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers' houses.

31. These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers' [houses] of the chief even as those of his younger brother.

## 1 Chronicles 25

1. Moreover David and the captains of the host set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did the work according to their service was:

2. of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king.

3. Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah and Shimei, Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh.

4. Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.

5. All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

6. All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.

7. And the number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful, was 288.

8. And they cast lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

9. Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and sons were twelve:

10. the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve:

11. the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve:

12. the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve:

30. for the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve:

31. for the four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.

## 1 Chronicles 26

1. For the courses of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Ebiasaph.

2. And Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

3. Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.

4. And Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth,

5. Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him.

6. Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor.

7. The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

8. All these were of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service; threescore and two of Obed-edom.

9. And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, valiant men, eighteen.

10. Also Hosah, of the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he wasn't the firstborn, yet his father made him chief),

11. Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.

12. Of these were the courses of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in the house of Yahweh.

13. And they cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers' houses, for every gate.

14. And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a discreet counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

15. To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse.

16. To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watch against watch.

17. Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two.

18. For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

19. These were the courses of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.

20. And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

21. The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers' [houses] belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.

22. The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of the house of Yahweh.

23. Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:

24. and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was leader over the treasures.

25. And his brothers: of Eliezer [came] Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son.

26. This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers' [houses], the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.

27. They dedicated out of the spoil won in battles to repair the house of Yahweh.

28. And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brothers.

29. Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.

30. Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh, and for the service of the king.

31. Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers' [houses]. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.

32. And his brothers, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred, heads of fathers' [houses], whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the king.

## 1 Chronicles 27

1. Now the sons of Israel after their number, [to wit], the heads of fathers' [houses] and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers that ministered to the king, in any matter of the courses which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year--of every course were twenty and four thousand.

2. Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

3. [He was] of the sons of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.

4. And over the course of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his course; and Mikloth the leader: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

5. The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

6. This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and his course was Ammizabad his son.

7. The fourth [captain] for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

8. The fifth captain for this fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

14. The eleventh [captain] for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the sons of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

15. The twelfth [captain] for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

16. Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the leader: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah:

17. of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of Aaron, Zadok:

18. of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David: of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:

19. of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel:

20. of the sons of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

21. of the half-[tribe] of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

22. of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.

23. But David did not take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of heaven.

24. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but didn't finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of King David.

25. And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:

26. And over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

27. and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine-cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:

28. and over the olive-trees and the sycamore-trees that were in the lowland was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:

29. and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:

30. and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.

31. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.

32. Also Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:

33. And Ahithophel was the king's counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion:

34. and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's host was Joab.

## 1 Chronicles 28

1. And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.

2. Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, Hear me, my brothers, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building.

3. But God said to me, You will not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.

4. Nevertheless Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever: for he has chosen Judah to be leader; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;

5. And of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel.

6. And he said to me, Solomon your son, he will build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.

7. And I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is constant to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.

8. Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your{+} God; that you{+} may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your{+} sons after you{+} forever.

9. And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.

10. Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

11. Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch [of the temple], and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of its upper rooms, and of its inner chambers, and of the place of the mercy-seat;

12. and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the chambers round about, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;

13. also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;

14. of gold by weight for the [vessels of] gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; [of silver] for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;

15. by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for their lamps, of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver, [silver] by weight for [every] lampstand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lampstand;

16. and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;

17. and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;

18. and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, [even] the cherubim, that spread out [their wings], and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.

19. All this, [said David], I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.

20. And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh is finished.

21. And, look, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there will be with you in all manner of work every willing man who has skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be wholly at your commandment.

## 1 Chronicles 29

1. And David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.

2. Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the [things of] gold, and the silver for the [things of] silver, and the bronze for the [things of] bronze, the iron for the [things of] iron, and wood for the [things of] wood; onyx stones, and [stones] to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of diverse colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.

3. Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,

4. even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;

5. of gold for the [things of] gold, and of silver for the [things of] silver, and for all manner of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?

6. Then the princes of the fathers' [houses], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly;

7. and they gave for the service of the house of God: of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.

8. And they with whom [precious] stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

9. Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

10. Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be you, O Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.

11. Yours, O Yahweh, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth [is yours]; yours is the kingdom, O Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.

12. Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.

13. Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.

14. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of you, and of your own we have given you.

15. For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no hope [to remain on the earth].

16. O Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.

17. I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you.

18. O Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you;

19. and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.

20. And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Yahweh your{+} God. And all the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshiped Yahweh, and the king.

21. And they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt-offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,

22. and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be leader, and Zadok to be priest.

23. Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

24. And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of King David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.

25. And Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

26. Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

27. And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three [years] he reigned in Jerusalem.

28. And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

29. Now the acts of David the king, first and last, look, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,

30. with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
