# 2 John

## 2 John 1

1. The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;

2. for the truth's sake which stays in us, and it will be with us forever:

3. Grace, mercy, peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

4. I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.

5. And now I urge you, lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

6. And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you{+} heard from the beginning, that you{+} should walk in it.

7. For many deceivers have gone forth into the world: those who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.

8. Look to yourselves, that you{+} don't lose the things which we have worked for, but that you{+} receive a full reward.

9. Whoever goes onward and doesn't stay in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God: he who stays in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.

10. If anyone comes to you{+}, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into [your{+}] house, and give him no greeting:

11. for he who gives him greeting shares in his evil works.

12. Having many things to write to you{+}, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you{+}, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.

13. The children of your elect sister greet you.
