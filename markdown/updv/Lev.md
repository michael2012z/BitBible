# Leviticus

## Leviticus 1

1. And Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tent of meeting, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, If man among you{+} offers an oblation to Yahweh, you{+} will offer your{+} oblation of the cattle, [even] of the herd and of the flock.

3. If his oblation is a burnt-offering of the herd, he will offer it a male without blemish: he will offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh.

4. And he will lay his hand on the head of the burnt-offering; and it will be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

5. And he will kill the bull before Yahweh: and Aaron's sons, the priests, will present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.

6. And he will flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.

7. And the sons of Aaron the priest will put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on the fire;

8. and Aaron's sons, the priests, will lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:

9. but its insides and its legs he will wash with water: and the priest will burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

10. And if his oblation is of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he will offer it a male without blemish.

11. And he will kill it on the side of the altar northward before Yahweh: and Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.

12. And he will cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:

13. but the insides and the legs he will wash with water; and the priest will offer the whole, and burn it on the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

14. And if his oblation to Yahweh is a burnt-offering of birds, then he will offer his oblation of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.

15. And the priest will bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood will be drained out on the side of the altar;

16. and he will take away its crop with its filth, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:

17. and he will rend it by its wings, [but] will not divide it apart; and the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

## Leviticus 2

1. And when anyone offers an oblation of a meal-offering to Yahweh, his oblation will be of fine flour; and he will pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it:

2. and he will bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he will take thereout his handful of the fine flour of it, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest will burn [it as] its memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh:

3. and that which is left of the meal-offering will be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.

4. And when you offer an oblation of a meal-offering baked in the oven, it will be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

5. And if your oblation is a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it will be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

6. You will part it in pieces, and pour oil on it: it is a meal-offering.

7. And if your oblation is a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it will be made of fine flour with oil.

8. And you will bring the meal-offering that is made of these things to Yahweh: and it will be presented to the priest, and he will bring it to the altar.

9. And the priest will take up from the meal-offering its memorial, and will burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

10. And that which is left of the meal-offering will be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.

11. No meal-offering, which you{+} will offer to Yahweh, will be made with leaven; for you{+} will burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

12. As an oblation of first [fruits] you{+} will offer them to Yahweh: but they will not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.

13. And every oblation of your meal-offering you will season with salt; neither will you allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meal-offering: with all your oblations you will offer salt.

14. And if you offer a meal-offering of first fruits to Yahweh, you will offer for the meal-offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.

15. And you will put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it: it is a meal-offering.

16. And the priest will burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain of it, and part of its oil, with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

## Leviticus 3

1. And if his oblation is a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offers of the herd, whether male or female, he will offer it without blemish before Yahweh.

2. And he will lay his hand on the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests will sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.

3. And he will offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,

4. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away.

5. And Aaron's sons will burn it on the altar on the burnt-offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

6. And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh is of the flock; male or female, he will offer it without blemish.

7. If he offers a lamb for his oblation, then he will offer it before Yahweh;

8. and he will lay his hand on the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons will sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.

9. And he will offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire fat tail, he will take away close by the backbone; and the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,

10. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away.

11. And the priest will burn it on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.

12. And if his oblation is a goat, then he will offer it before Yahweh:

13. and he will lay his hand on the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.

14. And he will offer of it his oblation, [even] an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,

15. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away.

16. And the priest will burn them on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Yahweh's.

17. It will be a perpetual statute throughout your{+} generations in all your{+} dwellings, that you{+} will eat neither fat nor blood.

## Leviticus 4

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If anyone will sin unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and will do any one of them:

3. if the anointed priest will sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin-offering.

4. And he will bring the bull to the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh; and he will lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before Yahweh.

5. And the anointed priest will take of the blood of the bull, and bring it to the tent of meeting:

6. and the priest will dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh, before the veil of the sanctuary.

7. And the priest will put of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he will pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.

8. And all the fat of the bull of the sin-offering he will take off from it; the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,

9. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away,

10. as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest will burn them on the altar of burnt-offering.

11. And the skin of the bull, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its insides, and its dung,

12. even the whole bull he will carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out it will be burnt.

13. And if the whole congregation of Israel should err, and the thing has been hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and are guilty;

14. when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly will offer a young bull for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.

15. And the elders of the congregation will lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull will be killed before Yahweh.

16. And the anointed priest will bring of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting:

17. and the priest will dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh, before the veil.

18. And he will put of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he will pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.

19. And all its fat he will take off from it, and burn it on the altar.

20. Thus he will do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin-offering, so he will do with this; and the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.

21. And he will carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.

22. When a ruler sins, and does unintentionally any one of all the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty;

23. if his sin, in which he has sinned, is made known to him, he will bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.

24. And he will lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where the burnt-offering will be killed before Yahweh: it is a sin-offering.

25. And the priest will take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and its blood he will pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.

26. And all its fat he will burn on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he will be forgiven.

27. And if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally, in doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and will be guilty;

28. if his sin, which he has sinned, is made known to him, then he will bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.

29. And he will lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.

30. And the priest will take of its blood with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all its blood he will pour out at the base of the altar.

31. And all its fat he will take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest will burn it on the altar for a sweet savor to Yahweh; and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.

32. And if he brings a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he will bring it a female without blemish.

33. And he will lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where the burnt-offering will be killed.

34. And the priest will take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all its blood he will pour out at the base of the altar:

35. and all its fat he will take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest will burn them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin that he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 5

1. And if anyone sins, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter [it], then he will bear his iniquity.

2. Or if anyone touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it was hidden from him, he became unclean, and he will be guilty.

3. Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is with which he is unclean, and it is hid from him; when he knows of it, then he will be guilty.

4. Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever man utters rashly with an oath, and it is hid from him; when he knows of it, then he will be guilty in one of these [things].

5. And it will be, when he will be guilty in one of these [things], that he will confess that in which he has sinned:

6. and he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin.

7. And if his means are not sufficient for a lamb, then he will bring his trespass-offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.

8. And he will bring them to the priest, who will offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but will not divide it apart:

9. and he will sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.

10. And he will offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.

11. But if his means are not sufficient for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he will bring his oblation for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he will put no oil on it, neither will he put any frankincense on it; for it is a sin-offering.

12. And he will bring it to the priest, and the priest will take his handful of it as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: it is a sin-offering.

13. And the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven: and it will be the priest's, as the meal-offering.

14. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

15. If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unintentionally, in the holy things of Yahweh; then he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:

16. and he will make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the holy thing, and will add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he will be forgiven.

17. And if anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it, yet he is guilty, and will bear his iniquity.

18. And he will bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he erred unintentionally and didn't know it, and he will be forgiven.

19. It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Yahweh.

## Leviticus 6

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against Yahweh, and deals falsely with his associate in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed his associate,

3. or has found that which was lost, and deals falsely in it, and swears to a lie; in any of all these things that man does, sinning in it;

4. then it will be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, that he will restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,

5. or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he will even restore it in full, and will add the fifth part more thereto: to him to whom it pertains he will give it, in the day of his being found guilty.

6. And he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering:

7. and the priest will make atonement for him before Yahweh; and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he does so as to be guilty by it.

8. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering will be on the hearth on the altar all night to the morning; and the fire of the altar will be kept burning on it.

10. And the priest will put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches he will put on his flesh; and he will take up the ashes whereto the fire has consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he will put them beside the altar.

11. And he will put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.

12. And the fire on the altar will be kept burning on it, it will not go out; and the priest will burn wood on it every morning: and he will lay the burnt-offering in order on it, and will burn on it the fat of the peace-offerings.

13. Fire will be kept burning on the altar continually; it will not go out.

14. And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron will offer it before Yahweh, before the altar.

15. And he will take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the meal-offering, and will burn it on the altar for a sweet savor, as its memorial, to Yahweh.

16. And that which is left of it will Aaron and his sons eat: it will be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they will eat it.

17. It will not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.

18. Every male among the sons of Aaron will eat of it, as [his] portion forever throughout your{+} generations, from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: whoever touches them will be holy.

19. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

20. This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they will offer to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening.

21. On a baking-pan it will be made with oil; when it is soaked, you will bring it in: in baked pieces you will offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh.

22. And the anointed priest who will be in his stead from among his sons will offer it: by a statute forever it will be wholly burnt to Yahweh.

23. And every meal-offering of the priest will be wholly burnt: it will not be eaten.

24. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

25. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed will the sin-offering be killed before Yahweh: it is most holy.

26. The priest who offers it for sin will eat it: in a holy place it will be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.

27. Whatever will touch its flesh will be holy; and when there is sprinkled of its blood on any garment, it will be washed that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.

28. But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled will be broken; and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it will be scoured, and rinsed in water.

29. Every male among the priests will eat of it: it is most holy.

30. And no sin-offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, will be eaten: it will be burnt with fire.

## Leviticus 7

1. And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy.

2. In the place where they kill the burnt-offering they will kill the trespass-offering; and its blood he will sprinkle on the altar round about.

3. And he will offer of it all its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the insides,

4. and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away;

5. and the priest will burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a trespass-offering.

6. Every male among the priests will eat of it: it will be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy.

7. As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest who makes atonement with it, he will have it.

8. And the priest who offers any man's burnt-offering, even the priest will have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he has offered.

9. And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, will be the priest's that offers it.

10. And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, will all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.

11. And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one will offer to Yahweh.

12. If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he will offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.

13. With cakes of leavened bread he will offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving.

14. And of it he will offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering to Yahweh; it will be the priest's that sprinkles the blood of the peace-offerings.

15. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving will be eaten on the day of his oblation; he will not leave any of it until the morning.

16. But if the sacrifice of his oblation is a vow, or a freewill-offering, it will be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day that which remains of it will be eaten:

17. but that which remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day will be burnt with fire.

18. And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be imputed to him who offers it: it will be contaminated, and the soul who eats of it will bear his iniquity.

19. And the flesh that touches any unclean thing will not be eaten; it will be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, everyone who is clean will eat of it:

20. but the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul will be cut off from his people.

21. And when anyone will touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or unclean beast, or any unclean reptile, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain to Yahweh, that soul will be cut off from his people.

22. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, You{+} will eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.

24. And the fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but you{+} will in no way eat of it.

25. For whoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats it will be cut off from his people.

26. And you{+} will eat no manner of blood, whether it is of bird or of beast, in any of your{+} dwellings.

27. Whoever it is that eats any blood, that soul will be cut off from his people.

28. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

29. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, He who offers the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to Yahweh will bring his oblation to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:

30. his own hands will bring the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; the fat with the breast he will bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Yahweh.

31. And the priest will burn the fat on the altar; but the breast will be Aaron's and his sons'.

32. And the right thigh you{+} will give to the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your{+} peace-offerings.

33. He among the sons of Aaron that offers the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, will have the right thigh for a portion.

34. For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh I have taken of the sons of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as [their] portion forever from the sons of Israel.

35. This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, in the day when he presented them to serve Yahweh in the priest's office;

36. which Yahweh commanded to be given to them of the sons of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is [their] portion forever throughout their generations.

37. This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;

38. which Yahweh commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the sons of Israel to offer their oblations to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.

## Leviticus 8

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;

3. and assemble all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.

4. And Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.

5. And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be done.

6. And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

7. And he put on him the coat, and girded him with the belt, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him, and he girded him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it to him with it.

8. And he placed the breastplate on him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.

9. And he set the turban on his head; and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

10. And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.

11. And he sprinkled of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them.

12. And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.

13. And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with belts, and bound head-tires on them; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

14. And he brought the bull of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin-offering.

15. And he slew it; and Moses took blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.

16. And he took all the fat that was on the insides, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it on the altar.

17. But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire outside the camp; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

18. And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

19. And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.

20. And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.

21. And he washed the insides and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram on the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire to Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

22. And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

23. And he slew it; and Moses took of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.

24. And he brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.

25. And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the insides, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:

26. and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on the right thigh:

27. and he put the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Yahweh.

28. And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar on the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

29. And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Yahweh: it was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

30. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

31. And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons will eat it.

32. And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread you{+} will burn with fire.

33. And you{+} will not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your{+} consecration are fulfilled: for he will consecrate you{+} seven days.

34. As has been done this day, so Yahweh has commanded [you{+}] to do, to make atonement for you{+}.

35. And at the door of the tent of meeting you{+} will remain day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Yahweh, that you{+} will not die: for so I am commanded.

36. And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.

## Leviticus 9

1. And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

2. and he said to Aaron, Take yourself a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Yahweh.

3. And to the sons of Israel you will speak, saying, Take{+} a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;

4. and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you{+}.

5. And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.

6. And Moses said, This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you{+} should do: and the glory of Yahweh will appear to you{+}.

7. And Moses said to Aaron, Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin-offering, and your burnt-offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Yahweh commanded.

8. So Aaron drew near to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.

9. And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:

10. but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt on the altar; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

11. And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire outside the camp.

12. And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about.

13. And they delivered the burnt-offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them on the altar.

14. And he washed the insides and the legs, and burnt them on the burnt-offering on the altar.

15. And he presented the people's oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, like the first.

16. And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.

17. And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.

18. He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,

19. and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that [fat] which covers [the entrails], and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:

20. and they put the fat on the breasts, and he burnt the fat on the altar:

21. and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Yahweh; as Moses commanded.

22. And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.

23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.

24. And there came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed on the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

## Leviticus 10

1. And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each of them took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.

2. And there came forth fire from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.

3. Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that Yahweh spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Draw near, carry your{+} brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

5. So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.

6. And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Don't let the hair of your{+} heads go loose, neither rend your{+} clothes; that you{+} will not die, and that he is not angry with all the congregation: but let your{+} brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.

7. And you{+} will not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, or else you{+} will die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you{+}. And they did according to the word of Moses.

8. And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,

9. Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you{+} go into the tent of meeting, that you{+} will not die: it will be a statute forever throughout your{+} generations:

10. and that you{+} may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;

11. and that you{+} may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses.

12. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the meal-offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;

13. and you{+} will eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons' portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: for so I am commanded.

14. And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh you{+} will eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons' portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the sons of Israel.

15. The heave-thigh and the wave-breast they will bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Yahweh: and it will be yours, and your sons' with you, as a portion forever; as Yahweh has commanded.

16. And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and noticed that it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,

17. Why haven't you{+} eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he has given it you{+} to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?

18. Look, the blood of it wasn't brought into the sanctuary inside: you{+} should have certainly eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.

19. And Aaron spoke to Moses, Look, this day they have offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Yahweh; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of Yahweh?

20. And when Moses heard [that], it was good in his eyes.

## Leviticus 11

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, These are the living things which you{+} may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

3. Whatever parts the hoof, and is clovenfooted, [and] chews the cud, among the beasts, that may you{+} eat.

4. Nevertheless these you{+} will not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those that part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof, he is unclean to you{+}.

5. And the coney, because he chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof, he is unclean to you{+}.

6. And the hare, because she chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof, she is unclean to you{+}.

7. And the swine, because he parts the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but doesn't chew the cud, he is unclean to you{+}.

8. Of their flesh you{+} will not eat, and their carcasses you{+} will not touch; they are unclean to you{+}.

9. These you{+} may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that you{+} may eat.

10. And all that don't have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are detestable to you{+},

11. and they will be detestable to you{+}; you{+} will not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you{+} will detest.

12. Whatever doesn't have fins and scales in the waters, that is detestable to you{+}.

13. And these you{+} will detest among the birds; they will not be eaten, they are detestable: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,

14. and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,

15. every raven after its kind,

16. and the ostrich, and the nighthawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,

17. and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

18. and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,

19. and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.

20. All winged creeping things that go on all fours are detestable to you{+}.

21. Yet these you{+} may eat of all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth.

22. Even these of those you{+} may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.

23. But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are detestable to you{+}.

24. And by these you{+} will become unclean: whoever touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening;

25. And whoever bears [anything] of their carcass will wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.

26. Every beast which parts the hoof, if it is either not clovenfooted, or does not chew the cud, is unclean to you{+}: everyone who touches them will be unclean.

27. And whatever goes on its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean to you{+}: whoever touches their carcass will be unclean until the evening.

28. And he who bears the carcass of them will wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: they are unclean to you{+}.

29. And these are unclean to you{+} among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,

30. and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.

31. These are unclean to you{+} among all that creep: whoever touches them when they are dead, will be unclean until the evening.

32. And whatever any of them falls on when they are dead, it will be unclean; whether it is any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it will be unclean until the evening; then it will be clean.

33. And every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, whatever is in it will be unclean, and it you{+} will break.

34. All food [in it] which may be eaten, that on which water comes, will be unclean; and all drink that may be drank in every [such] vessel will be unclean.

35. And every thing on which [any part] of their carcass falls will be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it will be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and will be unclean to you{+}.

36. Nevertheless a fountain or a pit in which is a gathering of water will be clean: but that which touches their carcass will be unclean.

37. And if [anything] of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.

38. But if water is put on the seed, and [anything] of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you{+}.

39. And if any beast, of which you{+} may eat, dies; he who touches its carcass will be unclean until the evening.

40. And he who eats of the carcass of it will wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: he also that bears the carcass of it will wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.

41. And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth is detestable; it will not be eaten.

42. Whatever goes on the belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things that creep on the earth, you{+} will not eat them; for they are detestable.

43. You{+} will not make yourselves detestable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither will you{+} make yourselves unclean with them, that you{+} should be defiled by them.

44. For I am Yahweh your{+} God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be{+} holy; for I am holy: neither will you{+} defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moves on the earth.

45. For I am Yahweh who brought you{+} up out of the land of Egypt, to be your{+} God: you{+} will therefore be holy, for I am holy.

46. This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth;

47. to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.

## Leviticus 12

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives seed, and bears a man-child, then she will be unclean seven days; as in the days of her menstrual impurity she will be unclean.

3. And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin will be circumcised.

4. And she will continue in the blood of [her] purifying three and thirty days; she will touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are fulfilled.

5. But if she bears a female child, then she will be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she will continue in the blood of [her] purifying threescore and six days.

6. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she will bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin-offering, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest:

7. and he will offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; and she will be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.

8. And if her means are not sufficient for a lamb, then she will take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.

## Leviticus 13

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. When man will have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he will be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:

3. and the priest will look at the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest will look at him, and pronounce him unclean.

4. And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest will shut up [him who has] the plague seven days:

5. and the priest will look at him the seventh day: and see if, in his eyes, the plague has stopped, the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest will shut him up seven days more:

6. and the priest will look at him again the seventh day; and see if the plague is dim, and the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he will wash his clothes, and be clean.

7. But if the scab spreads abroad in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he will show himself to the priest again:

8. and the priest will look; and see if the scab has spread in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.

9. When the plague of leprosy is in man, then he will be brought to the priest;

10. and the priest will look; and see if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the rising,

11. it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest will pronounce him unclean: he will not shut him up, for he is unclean.

12. And if the leprosy breaks out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of [him who has] the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appears to the priest;

13. then the priest will look; and see if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he will pronounce [him] clean [who has] the plague: it has all turned white: he is clean.

14. But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he will be unclean.

15. And the priest will look at the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.

16. Or if the raw flesh turns again, and has changed to white, then he will come to the priest;

17. and the priest will look at him; and see if the plague has turned into white, then the priest will pronounce [him] clean [who has] the plague: he is clean.

18. And when the flesh has a boil on it, and it is healed,

19. and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it will be shown to the priest;

20. and the priest will look; and see if its appearance is lower than the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.

21. But if the priest looks at it and sees there are no white hairs in it, and it is not lower than the skin, but is dim; then the priest will shut him up seven days:

22. And if it spreads abroad in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

23. But if the bright spot remains in its place, and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest will pronounce him clean.

24. Or when the flesh has in its skin a burning by fire, and the quick [flesh] of the burning becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;

25. then the priest will look at it; and see if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and its appearance is deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it has broken out in the burning: and the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

26. But if the priest looks at it, and sees there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is no lower than the skin, but is dim; then the priest will shut him up seven days:

27. and the priest will look at him the seventh day: if it spreads abroad in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

28. And if the bright spot remains in its place, and has not spread in the skin, but is dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest will pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.

29. And when a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard,

30. then the priest will look at the plague; and see if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and there is in it yellow thin hair, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.

31. And if the priest looks at the plague of the scall, and sees its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will shut up [him who has] the plague of the scall seven days:

32. And in the seventh day the priest will look at the plague; and see if the scall has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall is not deeper than the skin,

33. then he will be shaven, but the scall he will not shave; and the priest will shut up [him who has] the scall seven days more:

34. and in the seventh day the priest will look at the scall; and see if the scall has not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin; then the priest will pronounce him clean: and he will wash his clothes, and be clean.

35. But if the scall spreads abroad in the skin after his cleansing,

36. then the priest will look at him; and see if the scall has spread in the skin, the priest will not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.

37. But if in his eyes the scall has stopped, and black hair has grown up in it; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest will pronounce him clean.

38. And when a man or a woman has in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;

39. then the priest will look; and see if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh are of a dull white, it is a tetter, it has broken out in the skin; he is clean.

40. And if a man's hair falls off his head, he is bald; [yet] he is clean.

41. And if his hair falls off from the front part of his head, he is bald [on the] forehead; [yet] he is clean.

42. But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

43. Then the priest will look at him; and see if the rising of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;

44. he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest will surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.

45. And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes will be rent, and the hair of his head will go loose, and he will cover his upper lip, and will cry, Unclean, unclean.

46. All the days in which the plague is in him he will be unclean; he is unclean: he will dwell alone; outside the camp will be his dwelling.

47. The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a wool garment, or a linen garment;

48. whether it is in warp, or woof; of linen, or of wool; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;

49. if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and will be shown to the priest.

50. And the priest will look at the plague, and shut up [that which has] the plague seven days:

51. and he will look at the plague on the seventh day: if the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

52. And he will burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it will be burnt in the fire.

53. And if the priest will look, and see that the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;

54. then the priest will command that they wash the thing in which the plague is, and he will shut it up seven days more:

55. and the priest will look, after the plague is washed; and see if the plague has not changed its color, and the plague has not spread, it is unclean; you will burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be inside or outside.

56. And if the priest looks and sees that the plague is dim after the washing of it, then he will rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

57. and if it still appears in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: you will burn that in which the plague is with fire.

58. And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which you will wash, if the plague departs from them, then it will be washed the second time, and will be clean.

59. This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

## Leviticus 14

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. This will be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he will be brought to the priest:

3. and the priest will go forth out of the camp; and the priest will look; and see if the plague of leprosy has healed in the leper,

4. then will the priest command to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

5. And the priest will command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.

6. As for the living bird, he will take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and will dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:

7. And he will sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and will pronounce him clean, and will let the living bird go into the open field.

8. And he who is to be cleansed will wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he will be clean: and after that he will come into the camp, but will dwell outside his tent seven days.

9. And it will be on the seventh day, that he will shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he will shave off: and he will wash his clothes, and he will bathe his flesh in water, and he will be clean.

10. And on the eighth day he will take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

11. And the priest who cleanses him will set the man who is to be cleansed, and those things, before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.

12. And the priest will take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Yahweh:

13. and he will kill the he-lamb in the place where the sin-offering is killed and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:

14. and the priest will take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest will put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.

15. And the priest will take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;

16. and the priest will dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and will sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh:

17. and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand will the priest put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the blood of the trespass-offering:

18. and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be cleansed: and the priest will make atonement for him before Yahweh.

19. And the priest will offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he will kill the burnt-offering;

20. and the priest will offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering on the altar: and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean.

21. And if he is poor, and can't get so much, then he will take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;

22. and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one will be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.

23. And on the eighth day he will bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh:

24. and the priest will take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest will wave them for a wave-offering before Yahweh.

25. And he will kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest will take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.

26. And the priest will pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;

27. and the priest will sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Yahweh:

28. and the priest will put of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:

29. and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Yahweh.

30. And he will offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,

31. even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest will make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Yahweh.

32. This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get [that which pertains] to his cleansing.

33. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

34. When you{+} come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you{+} for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your{+} possession;

35. then he who owns the house will come and tell the priest, saying, There seems to me to be as it were a plague in the house.

36. And the priest will command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to see the plague, that all that is in the house is not made unclean: and afterward the priest will go in to see the house:

37. and he will look at the plague; and see if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and its appearance is lower than the wall;

38. then the priest will go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.

39. And the priest will come again the seventh day, and will look; and see if the plague has spread in the walls of the house;

40. then the priest will command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place outside the city:

41. and he will cause the house to be scraped inside round about, and they will pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, outside the city into an unclean place:

42. and they will take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he will take other mortar, and will plaster the house.

43. And if the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house, after that he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered;

44. then the priest will come in and look; and see if the plague has spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.

45. And he will break down the house, the stones of it, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house; and he will carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

46. Moreover he who goes into the house all the while that it is shut up will be unclean until the evening.

47. And he who lies in the house will wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house will wash his clothes.

48. And if the priest will come in, and look, and see that the plague has not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest will pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.

49. And he will take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

50. and he will kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:

51. and he will take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

52. and he will cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

53. but he will let go the living bird out of the city into the open field: so he will make atonement for the house; and it will be clean.

54. This is the law for every manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,

55. and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,

56. and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;

57. to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.

## Leviticus 15

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When any man has discharging out of his flesh a [genital] discharge, he is unclean.

3. And this will be his uncleanness in his discharge: whether his flesh runs his discharge, or his flesh be stopped from his discharge, he is unclean. All the days that his flesh runs his discharge or that his flesh withholds his discharge, it is his uncleanness.

4. Every bed on which he who has the discharge lies will be unclean; and everything on which he sits will be unclean.

5. And whoever touches his bed will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

6. And he who sits on anything on which he who has the discharge sat will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

7. And he who touches the flesh of him who has the discharge will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

8. And if he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

9. And whatever saddle he who has the discharge rides on will be unclean.

10. And whoever touches anything that was under him will be unclean until the evening: and he who bears those things will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

11. And whomever he who has the discharge touches, without having rinsed his hands in water, he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

12. And the earthen vessel, which he who has the discharge touches, will be broken; and every vessel of wood will be rinsed in water.

13. And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he will number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he will bathe his flesh in running water, and will be clean.

14. And on the eighth day he will take to himself two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before Yahweh to the door of the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest:

15. and the priest will offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest will make atonement for him before Yahweh for his discharge.

16. And if any man's semen goes out from him, then he will bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.

17. And every garment, and every skin, on which is the semen, will be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.

18. And if a woman will lie with a man, with an emission of semen, they will both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening.

19. And if a woman has a [genital] discharge, [and] her discharge in her flesh is blood, she will be in her impurity seven days: and whoever touches her will be unclean until the evening.

20. And everything that she lies on in her impurity will be unclean: everything also that she sits on will be unclean.

21. And whoever touches her bed will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

22. And whoever touches anything that she sits on will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

23. And if it is on the bed, or on anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he will be unclean until the evening.

24. And if any man lies with her, and her impurity is on him, he will be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies will be unclean.

25. And if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the discharge of her uncleanness she will be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean.

26. Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge will be to her as the bed of her impurity: and everything on which she sits will be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.

27. And whoever touches those things will be unclean, and will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

28. But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she will number to herself seven days, and after that she will be clean.

29. And on the eighth day she will take to herself two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.

30. And the priest will offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest will make atonement for her before Yahweh for the discharge of her uncleanness.

31. Thus you{+} will separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, that they will not die in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them.

32. This is the law of him who has a discharge, and of him whose semen goes from him, so that he is unclean by it;

33. and of her in her menstrual impurity, and of him who has a discharge, of the man, and of the woman, and of him who lies with her who is unclean.

## Leviticus 16

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Yahweh, and died;

2. and Yahweh said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he does not come at all times into the holy place inside the veil, before the mercy-seat which is on the ark; that he will not die: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy-seat.

3. Herewith will Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bull for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.

4. He will put on the holy linen coat, and he will have the linen breeches on his flesh, and will be girded with the linen belt, and with the linen turban he will be attired: they are the holy garments; and he will bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.

5. And he will take of the congregation of the sons of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.

6. And Aaron will present the bull of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.

7. And he will take the two goats, and set them before Yahweh at the door of the tent of meeting.

8. And Aaron will cast lots on the two goats; one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for Azazel.

9. And Aaron will present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh, and offer him for a sin-offering.

10. But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, will be set alive before Yahweh, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.

11. And Aaron will present the bull of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and will make atonement for himself, and for his house, and will kill the bull of the sin-offering which is for himself:

12. and he will take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it inside the veil:

13. and he will put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is on the testimony, that he will not die:

14. and he will take of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat he will sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

15. Then he will kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood inside the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:

16. and he will make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so he will do for the tent of meeting, that stays with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.

17. And there will not be any of man in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, until he comes out, and makes atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.

18. And he will go out to the altar that is before Yahweh, and make atonement for it, and will take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.

19. And he will sprinkle of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.

20. And when he has made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he will present the live goat:

21. and Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he will put them on the head of the goat, and will send him away by the hand of a man who is in readiness into the wilderness:

22. and the goat will bear on him all their iniquities to a solitary land: and he will let the goat go into the wilderness.

23. And Aaron will come into the tent of meeting, and will put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and will leave them there:

24. and he will bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.

25. And the fat of the sin-offering he will burn on the altar.

26. And he who lets the goat go for Azazel will wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he will come into the camp.

27. And the bull of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, will be carried forth outside the camp; and they will burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

28. And he who burns them will wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he will come into the camp.

29. And it will be a statute forever to you{+}: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you{+} will afflict your{+} souls, and will do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger who sojourns among you{+}:

30. for on this day atonement will be made for you{+}, to cleanse you{+}; from all your{+} sins you{+} will be clean before Yahweh.

31. It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you{+}, and you{+} will afflict your{+} souls; it is a statute forever.

32. And the priest, who will be anointed and who will be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead, will make the atonement, and will put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:

33. and he will make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he will make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he will make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.

34. And this will be an everlasting statute to you{+}, to make atonement for the sons of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Yahweh commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 17

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them: This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, saying,

3. Any man of the house of Israel, that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it outside the camp,

4. and has not brought it to the door of the tent of meeting to make it a burnt-offering or peace-offerings for Yahweh, so as to be accepted, as a pleasing odor, but kills it outside, and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting to offer it as an offering for Yahweh before the tabernacle of Yahweh: blood will be imputed to that man; he has shed blood; and that man will be cut off from among his people:

5. To the end that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them to Yahweh, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings to Yahweh.

6. And the priest will sprinkle the blood on the altar of Yahweh at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to Yahweh.

7. And they will no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the he-goats, which they prostitute after. This will be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.

8. And you will say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt-offering or sacrifice,

9. and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to Yahweh; that man will be cut off from his people.

10. And any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who eats any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

11. For the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you{+} on the altar to make atonement for your{+} souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul.

12. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, No soul of you{+} will eat blood, neither will any stranger who sojourns among you{+} eat blood.

13. And any man of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he will pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.

14. For the soul of all flesh is its blood, which is in its living body. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, You{+} will eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the soul of all flesh is its blood: whoever eats it will be cut off.

15. And every soul that eats that which dies of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he is home-born or a sojourner, he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening: then he will be clean.

16. But if he doesn't wash them, nor bathe his flesh, then he will bear his iniquity.

## Leviticus 18

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, I am Yahweh your{+} God.

3. After the doings of the land of Egypt, in which you{+} dwelt, you{+} will not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, where I bring you{+}, you{+} will not do; neither will you{+} walk in their statutes.

4. My ordinances you{+} will do, and my statutes you{+} will keep, to walk in them: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

5. You{+} will therefore keep my statutes, and my ordinances; which if man does, he will live in them: I am Yahweh.

6. Any man will not have any sex with anyone who is near of kin to him: I am Yahweh.

7. The nakedness of your father, even the nakedness of your mother, you will not uncover. She is your mother, you will not have any sex with her.

8. You will not have any sex with your father's wife, it is your father's nakedness.

9. With your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, you will not have any sex with them.

10. You will not have any sex with your son's daughter, or with your daughter's daughter: for theirs is your own nakedness.

11. You will not have any sex with your father's wife's daughter, begotten of your father, she is your sister.

12. You will not have any sex with your father's sister: she is your father's near kinswoman.

13. You will not have any sex with your mother's sister: for she is your mother's near kinswoman.

14. You will not have any sex with your father's brother, you will not have any sex with his wife: she is your aunt.

15. You will not have any sex with your daughter-in-law: she is your son's wife. You will not have any sex with her.

16. You will not have any sex with your brother's wife.

17. You will not have any sex with a woman and her daughter; you will not have any sex with her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter; they are her flesh: it is wickedness.

18. And you will not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival [to her], to have any sex with her, besides the other in her lifetime.

19. And you will not have sex with a woman, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.

20. And you will not have any sex with your associate's wife, to defile yourself with her.

21. And you will not give any of your seed to make them pass through [the fire] to Molech; neither will you profane the name of your God: I am Yahweh.

22. You will not have any sex with a man: it is disgusting.

23. And you will not have any sex with any animal and defile yourself with it; neither will any woman have any sex with an animal: it is perverted.

24. Don't defile yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations have been defiled which I am casting out from before you{+};

25. And the land is defiled: therefore I visit its iniquity on it, and the land vomits out her inhabitants.

26. You{+} therefore will keep my statutes and my ordinances, and will not do any of these disgusting things; neither the home-born, nor the stranger who sojourns among you{+};

27. for the men who were before you{+} in the land have done all these disgusting things, and the land is defiled;

28. that the land does not vomit you{+} out also, when you{+} defile it, as it is vomiting out the nation that was before you{+}.

29. For whoever will do any of these disgusting things, even the souls who do them will be cut off from among their people.

30. Therefore you{+} will keep my charge, that you{+} don't do any of these disgusting customs, which were done before you{+}, and that you{+} don't defile yourselves in them: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

## Leviticus 19

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and say to them, You{+} will be holy; for I, Yahweh your{+} God, am holy.

3. You{+} will fear every man his mother, and his father; and you{+} will keep my Sabbaths: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

4. Don't turn yourselves to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

5. And when you{+} offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, you{+} will offer it that you{+} may be accepted.

6. It will be eaten the same day you{+} offer it, and on the next day: and if anything remains until the third day, it will be burnt with fire.

7. And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is contaminated; it will not be accepted:

8. but everyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of Yahweh: and that soul will be cut off from his people.

9. And when you{+} reap the harvest of your{+} land, you will not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither will you gather the gleaning of your harvest.

10. And you will not glean your vineyard, neither will you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you will leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

11. You{+} will not steal; neither will you{+} deal falsely; nor lie; a man to his associate.

12. And you{+} will not swear by my name falsely, and [thus] you profane the name of your God: I am Yahweh.

13. You will not oppress your fellow man, nor rob him: the wages of a hired worker will not remain with you all night until the morning.

14. You will not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind; but you will fear your God: I am Yahweh.

15. You{+} will do no unrighteousness in judgment: you will not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness you will judge your associate.

16. You will not go up and down as a talebearer among your relatives: you will not stand against the blood of your fellow man: I am Yahweh.

17. You will not hate your brother in your heart: you will surely rebuke your associate, and not bear sin because of him.

18. You will not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people; but you will love your fellow man as yourself: I am Yahweh.

19. You{+} will keep my statutes. You will not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind: you will not sow your field with two kinds of seed: neither will there come upon you a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.

20. And whoever has any sex with a woman, who is a female slave, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they will be punished; they will not be put to death, because she was not free.

21. And he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, to the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.

22. And the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned: and the sin which he has sinned will be forgiven him.

23. And when you{+} will come into the land, and will have planted all manner of trees for food, then you{+} will count its fruit as their uncircumcision: three years they will be as uncircumcised to you{+}; it will not be eaten.

24. But in the fourth year all its fruit will be holy, for inauguration to Yahweh.

25. And in the fifth year you{+} will eat of its fruit, that it may yield to you{+} its increase: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

26. You{+} will not eat anything with the blood: neither will you{+} use magic, nor interpret omens.

27. You{+} will not round the corners of your{+} heads, neither will you mar the corners of your beard.

28. You{+} will not make any cuttings in your{+} flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you{+}: I am Yahweh.

29. Don't profane your daughter, to make her a prostitute; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.

30. You{+} will keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Yahweh.

31. Do{+} not turn to the spiritists or to the wizards; do not seek them out, to be defiled by them: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

32. You will rise up before the gray head, and honor the face of the old man, and you will fear your God: I am Yahweh.

33. And if a stranger sojourns with you in your{+} land, you{+} will not do him wrong.

34. The stranger who sojourns with you{+} will be to you{+} as the home-born among you{+}, and you will love him as yourself; for you{+} were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

35. You{+} will do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.

36. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, you{+} will have: I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} out of the land of Egypt.

37. And you{+} will observe all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them: I am Yahweh.

## Leviticus 20

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Moreover, you will say to the sons of Israel, Any man of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, that gives of his seed to Molech; he will surely be put to death: the people of the land will stone him with stones.

3. I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

4. And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives of his seed to Molech, and do not put him to death;

5. then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all those prostituting after him, to prostitute with Molech, from among their people.

6. And the soul who turns to the spiritists or the wizards, to prostitute after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

7. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be{+} holy; for I am Yahweh your{+} God.

8. And you{+} will keep my statutes, and do them: I am Yahweh who sanctifies you{+}.

9. For any man who curses his father or his mother will surely be put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood will be on him.

10. And the man who commits adultery with another man's wife--who commits adultery with his fellow man's wife--the adulterer and the adulteress will surely be put to death.

11. And the man who has any sex with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them will surely be put to death; their blood will be on them.

12. And if a man has any sex with his daughter-in-law, both of them will surely be put to death: they did something perverted; their blood will be on them.

13. And if a man has any sex with a man, both of them have done something disgusting: they will surely be put to death; their blood will be on them.

14. And if a man has any sex with his wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they will be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there will be no wickedness among you{+}.

15. And if a man has any sex with an animal, he will surely be put to death: and you{+} will slay the beast.

16. And if a woman has any sex with an animal, you will kill the woman, and the animal: they will surely be put to death; their blood will be on them.

17. And if a man will have any sex with his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, it is a shameful thing; and they will be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people: he has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he will bear his iniquity.

18. And if a man will have sex with a menstruating woman; he has made naked her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them will be cut off from among their people.

19. And you will not have any sex with your mother's sister, nor of your father's sister; for he has made naked his near kin: they will bear their iniquity.

20. And if a man will have any sex with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they will bear their sin; they will die childless.

21. And if a man will have any sex with his brother's wife, it is impurity: he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they will be childless.

22. You{+} will therefore keep all my statutes, and all my ordinances, and do them; that the land, where I am bringing you{+} to dwell in it, does not vomit you{+} out.

23. And you{+} will not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am casting out before you{+}: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

24. But I have said to you{+}, You{+} will inherit their land, and I will give it to you{+} to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Yahweh your{+} God, who has separated you{+} from the peoples.

25. You{+} will therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and you{+} will not make your{+} souls detestable by beast, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have separated from you{+} as unclean.

26. And you{+} will be holy to me: for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set you{+} apart from the peoples, that you{+} should be mine.

27. And a man or a woman among them, who is a spiritist or a wizard, will surely be put to death: they will stone them with stones; their blood will be on them.

## Leviticus 21

1. And Yahweh said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, None will defile himself for the dead among his relatives;

2. except for his kin, who is near to him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,

3. and for his sister a virgin, who is near to him, that has had no husband; for her he may defile himself.

4. He will not defile himself suddenly among his relatives, to profane himself.

5. They will not make baldness on their head, neither will they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.

6. They will be [in a state of] holiness to their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, the bread of their God, they offer: therefore they will be holy.

7. They will not take a woman who is a prostitute, or profane; neither will they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.

8. You will sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he will be holy to you: for I Yahweh, who sanctify you{+}, am holy.

9. And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by prostituting, she profanes her father: she will be burnt with fire.

10. And he who is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, will not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;

11. neither will he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;

12. neither will he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am Yahweh.

13. And he will take a wife in her virginity.

14. A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a prostitute, these he will not take: but a virgin of his own relatives he will take as wife.

15. And he will not profane his seed among his relatives: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.

16. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he is of your seed throughout their generations that has a blemish, do not let him approach to offer the bread of his God.

18. For whatever man he is that has a blemish, he will not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or anything superfluous,

19. or a man who is broken-footed, or broken-handed,

20. or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;

21. no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that has a blemish, will come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: he has a blemish; he will not come near to offer the bread of his God.

22. He will eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:

23. only he will not go in to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish; that he does not profane my sanctuaries: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

24. So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel.

## Leviticus 22

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they hallow to me, and that they don't profane my holy name: I am Yahweh.

3. Say to them, Whoever he is of all your{+} seed throughout your{+} generations, that approaches to the holy things, which the sons of Israel hallow to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul will be cut off from before me: I am Yahweh.

4. Any man of the seed of Aaron who is a leper, or has a discharge; he will not eat of the holy things, until he is clean. And whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man who has an emission of semen go out from him;

5. or whoever touches any creeping thing, by which he may be made unclean, or man who is unclean to him, whatever uncleanness he has;

6. the soul who touches any such will be unclean until the evening, and will not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.

7. And when the sun has gone down, he will be clean; and afterward he will eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.

8. That which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts, he will not eat, to defile himself with it: I am Yahweh.

9. They will therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die in it, if they profane it: I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

10. And no stranger will eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's, or a hired worker, will not eat of the holy thing.

11. But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money, he will eat of it, and one who is born in his house, they will eat of his bread.

12. And if a priest's daughter is married to a stranger, she will not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.

13. But if a priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and is returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she will eat of her father's bread: but no stranger will eat of it.

14. And if a man eats of the holy thing unintentionally, then he will put the fifth part of it to it, and will give to the priest the holy thing.

15. And they will not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,

16. and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

17. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, and from every sojourner who sojourns in Israel, who offers his oblation, whether it is any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt-offering;

19. that you{+} may be accepted, [you{+} will offer] a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.

20. But whatever has a blemish, that you{+} will not offer: for it will not be acceptable for you{+}.

21. And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it will be perfect to be accepted; there will be no blemish in it.

22. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, you{+} will not offer these to Yahweh, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.

23. Either a bull or a lamb that has anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that you may offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it will not be accepted.

24. That which is castrated by bruising, or crushing, or breaking, or cutting, you{+} will not offer to Yahweh; neither will you{+} do [thus] in your{+} land.

25. Neither from the hand of a foreigner will you{+} offer the bread of your{+} God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they will not be accepted for you{+}.

26. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

27. When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it will be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and from then on it will be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

28. And whether it is cow or ewe, you{+} will not kill it and its young both in one day.

29. And when you{+} sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, you{+} will sacrifice it that you{+} may be accepted.

30. On the same day it will be eaten; you{+} will leave none of it until the morning: I am Yahweh.

31. Therefore you{+} will keep my commandments, and do them: I am Yahweh.

32. And you{+} will not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the sons of Israel: I am Yahweh who hallows you{+},

33. who brought you{+} out of the land of Egypt, to be your{+} God: I am Yahweh.

## Leviticus 23

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, The set feasts of Yahweh, which you{+} will proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.

3. Six days will work be done: but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you{+} will do no manner of work: it is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your{+} dwellings.

4. These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you{+} will proclaim in their appointed season.

5. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, is Yahweh's Passover.

6. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Yahweh: seven days you{+} will eat unleavened bread.

7. In the first day you{+} will have a holy convocation: you{+} will do no servile work.

8. But you{+} will offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; you{+} will do no servile work.

9. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} come into the land which I give to you{+}, and will reap its harvest, then you{+} will bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your{+} harvest to the priest:

11. and he will wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you{+}: on the next day after the Sabbath the priest will wave it.

12. And in the day when you{+} wave the sheaf, you{+} will offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering to Yahweh.

13. And the meal-offering of it will be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering of it will be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.

14. And you{+} will eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this very same day, until you{+} have brought the oblation of your{+} God: it is a statute forever throughout your{+} generations in all your{+} dwellings.

15. And you{+} will count to yourselves from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you{+} brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; there will be seven complete Sabbaths:

16. even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you{+} will number fifty days; and you{+} will offer a new meal-offering to Yahweh.

17. From your{+} habitations you{+} will bring bread as a wave offering: two [loaves] of two tenth parts [of an ephah]: they will be of fine flour, they will be baked with leaven, for first fruits to Yahweh.

18. And you{+} will present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bull, and two rams: they will be a burnt-offering to Yahweh, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

19. And you{+} will offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.

20. And the priest will wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave-offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs: they will be holy to Yahweh for the priest.

21. And you{+} will make proclamation on the very same day; there will be a holy convocation to you{+}; you{+} will do no servile work: it is a statute forever in all your{+} dwellings throughout your{+} generations.

22. And when you{+} reap the harvest of your{+} land, you will not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither will you gather the gleaning of your harvest: you will leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

23. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, will be a solemn rest to you{+}, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.

25. You{+} will do no servile work; and you{+} will offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

26. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

27. Nevertheless on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it will be a holy convocation to you{+}, and you{+} will afflict your{+} souls; and you{+} will offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

28. And you{+} will do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you{+} before Yahweh your{+} God.

29. For whatever soul it is that will not be afflicted in that same day; he will be cut off from his relatives.

30. And whatever soul it is that does any manner of work in that same day, that soul I will destroy from among his people.

31. You{+} will do no manner of work: it is a statute forever throughout your{+} generations in all your{+} dwellings.

32. It will be to you{+} a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you{+} will afflict your{+} souls: in the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you{+} will keep your{+} Sabbath.

33. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

34. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days to Yahweh.

35. On the first day will be a holy convocation: you{+} will do no servile work.

36. Seven days you{+} will offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh: on the eighth day will be a holy convocation to you{+}; and you{+} will offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a solemn assembly; you{+} will do no servile work.

37. These are the set feasts of Yahweh, which you{+} will proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;

38. besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your{+} gifts, and besides all your{+} vows, and besides all your{+} freewill-offerings, which you{+} give to Yahweh.

39. Nevertheless on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you{+} have gathered in the fruits of the land, you{+} will keep the feast of Yahweh seven days: on the first day will be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day will be a solemn rest.

40. And you{+} will take to yourselves on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you{+} will rejoice before Yahweh your{+} God seven days.

41. And you{+} will keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year: it is a statute forever throughout your{+} generations; you{+} will keep it in the seventh month.

42. You{+} will dwell in booths seven days; all who are home-born in Israel will dwell in booths;

43. that your{+} generations may know that I made the sons of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

44. And Moses declared to the sons of Israel the set feasts of Yahweh.

## Leviticus 24

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.

3. Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron will keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually: it will be a statute forever throughout your{+} generations.

4. He will keep in order the lamps on the pure lampstand before Yahweh continually.

5. And you will take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts [of an ephah] will be in one cake.

6. And you will set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before Yahweh.

7. And you will put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

8. Every Sabbath day he will set it in order before Yahweh continually; it is on the behalf of the sons of Israel, an everlasting covenant.

9. And it will be for Aaron and his sons; and they will eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.

10. And a son of a woman of Israel, who was also a son of a man of Egypt, went out among the sons of Israel; and the son of the Israeli woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:

11. and the son of the Israeli woman blasphemed the name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.

12. And they put him in ward, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of Yahweh.

13. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

14. Bring forth him who has cursed outside the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

15. And you will speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Any man who curses his God will bear his sin.

16. And he who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he will surely be put to death; all the congregation will certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemes the name [of Yahweh], will be put to death.

17. And a man who strikes any life of man, will surely be put to death.

18. And he who strikes a beast mortally will make it good, life for life.

19. And if a man causes a blemish in his associate; as he has done, so it will be done to him:

20. breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has caused a blemish in man, so it will be rendered to him.

21. And he who kills a beast will make it good: and he who kills man will be put to death.

22. You{+} will have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Yahweh your{+} God.

23. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel; and they brought forth him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the sons of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 25

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} come into the land which I give you{+}, then the land will keep a Sabbath to Yahweh.

3. Six years you will sow your field, and six years you will prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruits;

4. but in the seventh year will be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh: you will neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.

5. That which grows of itself of your harvest you will not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you will not gather: it will be a year of solemn rest for the land.

6. And the Sabbath of the land will be for food for you{+}; for you, and for your male slave and for your female slave, and for your hired worker and for your stranger, who sojourn with you.

7. And for your cattle, and for the beasts that are in your land, will all its increase be for food.

8. And you will number seven Sabbaths of years to yourself, seven times seven years; and there will be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.

9. Then you will send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement you{+} will send abroad the trumpet throughout all your{+} land.

10. And you{+} will hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants: it will be a jubilee to you{+}; and you{+} will return every man to his possession, and you{+} will return every man to his family.

11. A jubilee will that fiftieth year be to you{+}: you{+} will not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of the undressed vines.

12. For it is a jubilee; it will be holy to you{+}: you{+} will eat its increase out of the field.

13. In this year of jubilee you{+} will return every man to his possession.

14. And if you{+} sell anything to your associate, or buy from your associate, you{+} will not wrong one another.

15. According to the number of years after the jubilee you will buy of your associate, [and] according to the number of years of the crops he will sell to you.

16. According to the multitude of the years you will increase its price, and according to the fewness of the years you will diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops he sells to you.

17. And you{+} will not wrong, a man and his associate; but you will fear your God: for I am Yahweh your{+} God.

18. Therefore you{+} will do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you{+} will dwell in the land in safety.

19. And the land will yield its fruit, and you{+} will eat your{+} fill, and dwell in it in safety.

20. And if you{+} will say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Look, we will not sow, nor gather in our increase;

21. then I will command my blessing on you{+} in the sixth year, and it will bring forth fruit for the three years.

22. And you{+} will sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you{+} will eat the old store.

23. And the land will not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for you{+} are strangers and sojourners with me.

24. And in all the land of your{+} possession you{+} will grant a redemption for the land.

25. If your brother is waxed poor, and sells some of his possession, then his kinsman who is next to him will come, and will redeem that which his brother has sold.

26. And if a man has no one to redeem it, and he is waxed rich and finds enough to redeem it;

27. then let him reckon the years of its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he will return to his possession.

28. But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold will remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it will go out, and he will return to his possession.

29. And if a man sells a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year he will have the right of redemption.

30. And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city will be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations: it will not go out in the jubilee.

31. But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them will be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they will go out in the jubilee.

32. Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.

33. And when one of the Levites redeems, the house that was sold, in the the city of his possession, will go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.

34. But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.

35. And if your brother is waxed poor, and his hand fails with you; then you will uphold him: [as] a stranger [who is a] sojourner he will live with you.

36. Take no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.

37. You will not give him your money on interest, nor give him your victuals for increase.

38. I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you{+} the land of Canaan, [and] to be your{+} God.

39. And if your brother is waxed poor with you, and sells himself to you; you will not make him to serve as a slave.

40. As a hired worker, and as a sojourner, he will be with you; he will serve with you to the year of jubilee:

41. and then he will go out from you, he and his sons with him, and then will return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers he will return.

42. For they are my slaves, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they will not be sold as a slave.

43. You will not rule over him with rigor, but will fear your God.

44. And as for your male slave, and your female slave, whom you will have; of the nations that are round about you{+}, of them you{+} will buy a male slave and a female slave.

45. Moreover of the sons of the strangers who sojourn among you{+}, of them you{+} will buy, and of their families who are with you{+}, which they have begotten in your{+} land: and they will be your{+} possession.

46. And you{+} will make them an inheritance for your{+} sons after you{+}, to hold for a possession; of them you{+} will take your{+} slaves forever: but over your{+} brothers the sons of Israel you{+} will not rule, one over another, with rigor.

47. And if a stranger [who is a] sojourner with you is waxed rich, and your brother is waxed poor beside him, and sells himself to a stranger [who is a] sojourner with you, or to the stock of the stranger's family;

48. after he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brothers may redeem him;

49. or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any who is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he is waxed rich, he may redeem himself.

50. And he will reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale will be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired worker he will be with him.

51. If there are yet many years, according to them he will give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

52. And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he will reckon with him; according to his years he will give back the price of his redemption.

53. As a worker hired year by year he will be with him: he will not rule with rigor over him in your sight.

54. And if he is not redeemed by these [means], then he will go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his sons with him.

55. For to me the sons of Israel are slaves; they are my slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your{+} God.

## Leviticus 26

1. You{+} will not make yourselves idols, neither will you{+} rear yourselves up a graven image, or a pillar, neither will you{+} place any figured stone in your{+} land, to bow down to it: for I am Yahweh your{+} God.

2. You{+} will keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Yahweh.

3. If you{+} walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;

4. then I will give your{+} rains in their season, and the land will yield its increase, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit.

5. And your{+} threshing will reach to the vintage, and the vintage will reach to the sowing time; and you{+} will eat your{+} bread to the full, and dwell in your{+} land safely.

6. And I will give peace in the land, and you{+} will lie down, and none will make you{+} afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither will the sword go through your{+} land.

7. And you{+} will chase your{+} enemies, and they will fall before you{+} by the sword.

8. And five of you{+} will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you{+} will chase ten thousand; and your{+} enemies will fall before you{+} by the sword.

9. And I will have respect to you{+}, and make you{+} fruitful, and multiply you{+}, and will establish my covenant with you{+}.

10. And you{+} will eat old store long kept, and you{+} will bring forth the old because of the new.

11. And I will set my tabernacle among you{+}: and my soul will not abhor you{+}.

12. And I will walk among you{+}, and will be your{+} God, and you{+} will be my people.

13. I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} forth out of the land of Egypt, that you{+} should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your{+} yoke, and made you{+} go upright.

14. But if you{+} will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;

15. and if you{+} will reject my statutes, and if your{+} soul abhors my ordinances, so that you{+} will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;

16. I also will do this to you{+}: I will appoint terror over you{+}, even consumption and fever, that will consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you{+} will sow your{+} seed in vain, for your{+} enemies will eat it.

17. And I will set my face against you{+}, and you{+} will be struck before your{+} enemies: those who hate you{+} will rule over you{+}; and you{+} will flee when none pursues you{+}.

18. And if you{+} will not yet for these things listen to me, then I will chastise you{+} seven times more for your{+} sins.

19. And I will break the pride of your{+} power: and I will make your{+} heaven as iron, and your{+} earth as bronze;

20. and your{+} strength will be spent in vain; for your{+} land will not yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.

21. And if you{+} walk contrary to me, and will not listen to me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you{+} according to your{+} sins.

22. And I will send the beast of the field among you{+}, which will rob you{+} of your{+} children, and destroy your{+} cattle, and make you{+} few in number; and your{+} ways will become desolate.

23. And if by these things you{+} will not be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;

24. then I will also walk contrary to you{+}; and I will strike you{+}, even I, seven times for your{+} sins.

25. And I will bring a sword on you{+}, that will execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you{+} will be gathered together inside your{+} cities: and I will send the pestilence among you{+}; and you{+} will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

26. When I break your{+} staff of bread, ten women will bake your{+} bread in one oven, and they will deliver your{+} bread again by weight: and you{+} will eat, and not be satisfied.

27. And if you{+} will not for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;

28. then I will walk contrary to you{+} in wrath; and I also will chastise you{+} seven times for your{+} sins.

29. And you{+} will eat the flesh of your{+} sons, and the flesh of your{+} daughters you{+} will eat.

30. And I will destroy your{+} high places, and cut down your{+} sun-images, and cast your{+} dead bodies on the bodies of your{+} idols; and my soul will abhor you{+}.

31. And I will make your{+} cities a waste, and will bring your{+} sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your{+} sweet odors.

32. And I will bring the land into desolation; and your{+} enemies that dwell in it will be astonished at it.

33. And you{+} I will scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you{+}: and your{+} land will be a desolation, and your{+} cities will be a waste.

34. Then will the land enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you{+} are in your{+} enemies' land; even then will the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.

35. As long as it lies desolate it will have rest, even the rest which it did not have in your{+} Sabbaths, when you{+} dwelt on it.

36. And as for those who are left of you{+}, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf will chase them; and they will flee, as one flees from the sword; and they will fall when none pursues.

37. And they will stumble one on another, as it were before the sword, when none pursues: and you{+} will have no power to stand before your{+} enemies.

38. And you{+} will perish among the nations, and the land of your{+} enemies will eat you{+} up.

39. And those who are left of you{+} will pine away in their iniquity in your{+} enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they will pine away with them.

40. And they will confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,

41. I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;

42. then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham I will remember; and I will remember the land.

43. The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.

44. And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them completely, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;

45. but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.

46. These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the sons of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.

## Leviticus 27

1. And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man will accomplish a vow, the persons will be for Yahweh by your estimation.

3. And your estimation will be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation will be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

4. And if it is a female, then your estimation will be thirty shekels.

5. And if it is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation will be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

6. And if it is from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation will be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation will be three shekels of silver.

7. And if it is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your estimation will be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

8. But if he is poorer than your estimation, then he will be set before the priest, and the priest will value him; according to the ability of him who vowed will the priest value him.

9. And if it is a beast, of which men offer an oblation to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh will be holy.

10. He will not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he will at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy.

11. And if it is any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to Yahweh, then he will set the beast before the priest;

12. and the priest will value it, whether it is good or bad: as you the priest value it, so it will be.

13. But if he will indeed redeem it, then he will add the fifth part of it to your estimation.

14. And when a man will sanctify his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest will estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest will estimate it, so it will stand.

15. And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he will add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it will be his.

16. And if a man will sanctify to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your estimation will be according to its sowing: the sowing of a homer of barley [will be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.

17. If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it will stand.

18. But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest will reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee; and an abatement will be made from your estimation.

19. And if he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he will add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it will be assured to him.

20. And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it will not be redeemed anymore:

21. but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, will be holy to Yahweh, as a field devoted; its possession will be the priest's.

22. And if he sanctifies to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession;

23. then the priest will reckon to him the worth of your estimation to the year of jubilee: and he will give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.

24. In the year of jubilee the field will return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.

25. And all your estimations will be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs will be the shekel.

26. Only the firstborn among beasts, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man will sanctify it; whether it is ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's.

27. And if it is of an unclean beast, then he will ransom it according to your estimation, and will add to it the fifth part of it: or if it is not redeemed, then it will be sold according to your estimation.

28. Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man will devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, will be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.

29. No one devoted, that will be devoted from among man, will be ransomed; he will surely be put to death.

30. And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh's: it is holy to Yahweh.

31. And if a man will redeem anything of his tithe, he will add to it the fifth part of it.

32. And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth will be holy to Yahweh.

33. He will not search whether it is good or bad, neither will he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy; it will not be redeemed.

34. These are the commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sinai.
