# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

2. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Yahweh has spoken: I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.

3. The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib; [but] Israel does not know, my people do not consider.

4. Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Yahweh, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged backward.

5. Why will you{+} be still stricken, that you{+} revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

6. From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they haven't been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.

7. Your{+} country is desolate; your{+} cities are burned with fire; your{+} land, strangers devour it in your{+} presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

8. And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

9. Except Yahweh of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.

10. Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you{+} people of Gomorrah.

11. What to me is the multitude of your{+} sacrifices? says Yahweh: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.

12. When you{+} come to see my face, who has required this at your{+} hand, to trample my courts?

13. Bring no more vain oblations; incense is disgusting to me; new moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies--I can't endure evil and the solemn meeting.

14. Your{+} new moons and your{+} appointed feasts my soul hates; they are a trouble to me; I am weary of bearing them.

15. And when you{+} spread forth your{+} hands, I will hide my eyes from you{+}; yes, when you{+} make many prayers, I will not hear: your{+} hands are full of blood.

16. Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your{+} doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;

17. learn to do well; seek justice, correct oppression, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

18. Come now, and let us reason together, says Yahweh: though your{+} sins be as scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they will be as wool.

19. If you{+} are willing and obedient, you{+} will eat the good of the land:

20. but if you{+} refuse and rebel, you{+} will be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.

21. How has the faithful city become a prostitute! She that was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.

22. Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.

23. Your princes are rebellious, and partners of thieves; everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards: they do not judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.

24. Therefore says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies;

25. and I will turn my hand on you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all your tin;

26. and I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning: afterward you will be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.

27. Zion will be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.

28. But the destruction of transgressors and sinners will be together, and those who forsake Yahweh will be consumed.

29. For they will be ashamed of the oaks which you{+} have desired, and you{+} will be confounded for the gardens that you{+} have chosen.

30. For you{+} will be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.

31. And the strong will be as flax, and his work as a spark; and they will both burn together, and none will quench them.

## Isaiah 2

1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

2. And it will come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's house will be established on the top of the mountains, and will be exalted above the hills; and all nations will flow to it.

3. And many peoples will go and say, Come{+}, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.

4. And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.

5. O house of Jacob, come{+}, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.

6. For you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with customs] from the east, and [are] omen interpreters like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.

7. And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.

8. Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.

9. And man is bowed down, and a man is brought low: therefore don't forgive them.

10. Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty.

11. The lofty looks of man will be brought low, and the haughtiness of men will be bowed down, and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.

12. For there will be a day of Yahweh of hosts on all that is proud and haughty, and on all that is lifted up; and it will be brought low;

13. and on all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and on all the oaks of Bashan,

14. and on all the high mountains, and on all the hills that are lifted up,

15. and on every lofty tower, and on every fortified wall,

16. and on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasant imagery.

17. And the loftiness of man will be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men will be brought low; and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.

18. And the idols will completely pass away.

19. And men will go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to mightily shake the earth.

20. In that day man will cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;

21. to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to mightily shake the earth.

22. Cease yourselves from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for what is he to be accounted of?

## Isaiah 3

1. For, look, the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and means of support, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water;

2. the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the fortune-teller, and the elder;

3. the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the expert artificer, and the expert charmer.

4. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes will rule over them.

5. And the people will be oppressed, man against man, and a man by his fellow man: the child will behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.

6. When a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], You have clothing, be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand;

7. in that day he will lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: you{+} will not make me ruler of the people.

8. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

9. The expression of their face witnesses against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have done evil to themselves.

10. Say{+} of the righteous, that [it will be] well [with him]; for they will eat the fruit of their doings.

11. Woe to the wicked! [It will be] ill [with him]; for what his hands have done will be done to him.

12. As for my people, children are their oppressors, and usurers rule over them. O my people, those who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.

13. Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.

14. Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and its princes: It is you{+} who have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your{+} houses:

15. what do you{+} mean that you{+} crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.

16. Moreover Yahweh said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;

17. therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the top of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Yahweh will lay bare their secret parts.

18. In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;

19. the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;

20. the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;

21. the rings, and the nose-jewels;

22. the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;

23. the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.

24. And it will come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there will be rottenness; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.

25. Your men will fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.

26. And her gates will lament and mourn; and she will sit on the ground emptied.

## Isaiah 4

1. And seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach.

2. In that day the branch of Yahweh will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be excellent and comely for those who have escaped of Israel.

3. And it will come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, will be called holy, even everyone who is written to life in Jerusalem;

4. when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.

5. And Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory [will be spread] a covering.

6. And there will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.

## Isaiah 5

1. Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:

2. and he dug it, and gathered out its stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a wine press in it: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you{+}, between me and my vineyard.

4. What more could have been done to my vineyard, that I haven't done in it? Why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, did it bring forth wild grapes?

5. And now I will tell you{+} what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up; I will break down its wall, and it will be trodden down:

6. and I will lay it waste; it will not be pruned nor hoed; but there will come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.

7. For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, look, oppression; for righteousness, but, look, a cry.

8. Woe to those who join house to house, that lay field to field, until there is no room, and you{+} are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!

9. Yahweh of hosts [revealed] in my ears, Of a truth many houses will be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

10. For ten acres of vineyard will yield one bath, and a homer of seed will yield [but] an ephah.

11. Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, until wine inflames them!

12. And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Yahweh, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.

13. Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.

14. Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend [into it].

15. And man is bowed down, and a man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:

16. but Yahweh of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.

17. Then the lambs will be shepherded as in their pasture, and wanderers will eat the waste places of the fat ones.

18. Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;

19. that say, Let him make speed, let him hurry his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!

20. Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

21. Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

22. Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;

23. that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!

24. Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom will go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

25. Therefore is the anger of Yahweh kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has struck them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

26. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, look, they will come with speed swiftly.

27. None will be weary nor stumble among them; none will slumber nor sleep; neither will the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the strap of their sandals be broken:

28. whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs will be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:

29. their roaring will be like a lioness, they will roar like young lions; yes, they will roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there will be none to deliver.

30. And they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one looks to the land, look, darkness [and] distress; and the light is darkened in its clouds.

## Isaiah 6

1. In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.

2. Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

3. And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

4. And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

5. Then I said, Woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of hosts.

6. Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live charcoal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:

7. and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Look, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.

8. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here I am; send me.

9. And he said, Go, and tell this people, You{+} indeed hear, but don't understand; and you{+} indeed see, but don't perceive.

10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; or else they will see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.

11. Then I said, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes completely waste,

12. and Yahweh has removed man far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.

13. And if there is yet a tenth in it, it also will in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth or as an oak whose stump remains when it is felled; so the holy seed is its stump.

## Isaiah 7

1. And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

2. And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.

3. Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field;

4. and say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; don't be afraid, neither let your heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

5. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against you, saying,

6. Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach in it for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;

7. thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, It will not stand, neither will it come to pass.

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years will Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that it will not be a people:

9. and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you{+} will not believe, surely you{+} will not be established.

10. And Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,

11. Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I try Yahweh.

13. And he said, Hear{+} now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you{+} to weary men, that you{+} will weary my God also?

14. Therefore the Lord himself will give you{+} a sign: look, the young woman will be pregnant, and give birth to a son, and will call his name Immanuel.

15. Butter and honey he will eat, when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.

16. For before the child will know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor will be forsaken.

17. Yahweh will bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah--[even] the king of Assyria.

18. And it will come to pass in that day, that Yahweh will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

19. And they will come, and will rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all thorn-hedges, and on all pastures.

20. In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, [even] with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it will also consume the beard.

21. And it will come to pass in that day, that a man will keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;

22. and it will come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they will give he will eat butter: for butter and honey will every one eat who is left in the midst of the land.

23. And it will come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, will be for briers and thorns.

24. With arrows and with bow will one come there, because all the land will be briers and thorns.

25. And all the hills that were dug with the mattock, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it will be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.

## Isaiah 8

1. And Yahweh said to me, Take for yourself a great tablet, and write on it with the pen of common man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;

2. and I will take to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

3. And I went to the prophetess; and she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son. Then Yahweh said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

4. For before the child will have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.

5. And Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,

6. Since this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

7. now therefore, look, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the River, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks;

8. and it will sweep onward into Judah; it will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, O Immanuel.

9. Make an uproar, O you{+} peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all you{+} of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.

10. Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand: for God is with us.

11. For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and he turned me away [so as] not to walk in the way of this people, saying,

12. Don't say{+}, A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people will say, A conspiracy; neither be{+} afraid of their fear, nor be in dread [of it].

13. Yahweh of hosts, you{+} will sanctify him; and let him be your{+} fear, and let him be your{+} dread.

14. And he will be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15. And many will stumble on it, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

16. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

17. And I will wait for Yahweh, that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

18. Look, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, who stays in mount Zion.

19. And when they will say to you{+}, Seek to the spiritists and to the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? On behalf of the living [should they seek] to the dead?

20. To the law and to the testimony! If they don't speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.

21. And they will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will come to pass that, when they will be hungry, they will fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward:

22. and they will look to the earth, and see distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and into thick darkness [they will be] driven away.

## Isaiah 9

1. But there will be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

2. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light: those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, on them light has shined.

3. You have multiplied the nation, you have increased their joy: they joy before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

4. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.

5. For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, for fuel of fire.

6. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be on his shoulder: and his name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

7. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from now on even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will perform this.

8. The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has fallen on Israel.

9. And all the people will know, [even] Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart,

10. The bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stone; the sycamores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.

11. Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,

12. the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

13. Yet the people haven't turned to him who struck them, neither have they sought Yahweh of hosts.

14. Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.

15. The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teaches lies, he is the tail.

16. For those who lead this people cause them to err; and those who are led of them are destroyed.

17. Therefore the Lord will not show mercy over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

18. For wickedness burns as the fire; it devours the briers and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.

19. Through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts is the land darkened; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spares his brother.

20. And one will snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied: they will eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

21. Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together will be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

## Isaiah 10

1. Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write perverseness;

2. to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!

3. And what will you{+} do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from far? To whom will you{+} flee for help? And where will you{+} leave your{+} glory?

4. They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

5. Ho Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!

6. I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath I will give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

7. Nevertheless he does not mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.

8. For he says, Are not my princes all of them kings?

9. Isn't Calno as Carchemish? Isn't Hamath as Arpad? Isn't Samaria as Damascus?

10. As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

11. shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?

12. Therefore it will come to pass, that, when the Lord has performed his whole work on mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

13. For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and like a valiant man I have brought down those who sit [on thrones]:

14. and my hand has found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathers eggs that are forsaken, I have gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.

15. Will the ax boast itself against him who cuts with it? Will the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, [or] as if a staff should lift up [him who is] not wood.

16. Therefore will the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there will be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.

17. And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.

18. And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and it will be as when a standard-bearer faints.

19. And the remnant of the trees of his forest will be few, so that a child may write them.

20. And it will come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped of the house of Jacob, will no more again lean on him who struck them, but will lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

21. A remnant will return, [even] the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

22. For though your people, Israel, are as the sand of the sea, [only] a remnant of them will return: a destruction [is] determined, overflowing with righteousness.

23. For a full end, and that determined, will the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth.

24. Therefore thus says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, don't be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strikes you with the rod, and lifts up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.

25. For yet a very little while, and the indignation [against you] will be accomplished, and my anger [will be directed] to his destruction.

26. And Yahweh of hosts will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up after the manner of Egypt.

27. And it will come to pass in that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke will be destroyed by reason of fatness.

28. He has come to Aiath, he has passed through Migron; at Michmash he lays up his baggage;

29. they have gone over the pass; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled.

30. Cry aloud with your voice, O daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! O you poor Anathoth!

31. Madmenah is a fugitive; the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.

32. This very day he will halt at Nob: he shakes his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Look, the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, will lop the boughs with terror: and the high of stature will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.

34. And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by a mighty one.

## Isaiah 11

1. And there will come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.

2. And the Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.

3. And his delight will be in the fear of Yahweh; and he will not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither decide after the hearing of his ears;

4. but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.

5. And righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.

6. And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat; and the calf and the young lion will grow fat together; and a little child will lead them.

7. And the cow and the bear will be shepherded; their young ones will lie down together; and the lion will eat straw like the ox.

8. And the nursing child will play on the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child will put his hand on the adder's den.

9. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of knowledge of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.

10. And it will come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, that stands for an ensign of the peoples, to him will the nations seek; and his resting-place will be glorious.

11. And it will come to pass in that day, that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, that will remain, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

12. And he will set up an ensign for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

13. The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who vex Judah will be cut off: Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not vex Ephraim.

14. And they will fly down on the shoulder of the Philistines on the west; together they will despoil the sons of the east: they will put forth their hand on Edom and Moab; and the sons of Ammon will obey them.

15. And Yahweh will completely destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will strike it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals.

16. And there will be a highway for the remnant of his people, that will remain, from Assyria; like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

## Isaiah 12

1. And in that day you will say, I will give thanks to you, O Yahweh; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.

2. Look, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.

3. Therefore with joy you{+} will draw water out of the wells of salvation.

4. And in that day you{+} will say, Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name, declare his doings among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted.

5. Sing to Yahweh; for he has done excellent things: let this be known in all the earth.

6. Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 13

1. The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.

2. Set{+} up an ensign on the bare mountain, lift up the voice to them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

3. I have commanded my consecrated ones, yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.

4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people! The noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Yahweh of hosts is mustering the host for the battle.

5. They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

6. Wail{+}; for the day of Yahweh is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty it will come.

7. Therefore all hands will be feeble, and every heart of common man will melt:

8. and they will be dismayed; pangs and sorrows will take hold [of them]; they will be in pain as a woman in travail: they will look in amazement one at another; their faces [will be] faces of flame.

9. Look, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners out of it.

10. For the stars of heaven and its constellations will not give their light; the sun will be darkened in its going forth, and the moon will not cause its light to shine.

11. And I will punish the world for [their] evil, and the wicked for their iniquity: and I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

12. I will make common man more rare than fine gold, even man more than the pure gold of Ophir.

13. Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place, in the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

14. And it will come to pass, that as the chased roe, and as sheep that no man gathers, they will turn every man to his own people, and will flee every man to his own land.

15. Everyone who is found will be thrust through; and everyone who is taken will fall by the sword.

16. Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses will be rifled, and their wives raped.

17. Look, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not regard silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it.

18. And [their] bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye will not spare sons.

19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It will never be inhabited, neither will it be stayed in from generation to generation: neither will the Arabian pitch tent there; neither will shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.

21. But wild beasts of the desert will lie there; and their houses will be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches will stay there, and wild goats will dance there.

22. And wolves will cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.

## Isaiah 14

1. For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the sojourner will join himself with them, and they will be united to the house of Jacob.

2. And the peoples will take them, and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel will possess them in the land of Yahweh for male slaves and for female slaves: and they will take them captive whose captives they were; and they will rule over their oppressors.

3. And it will come to pass in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow, and from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to serve,

4. that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! The arrogance has ceased!

5. Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers;

6. that struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled the nations in anger with a persecution that none restrained.

7. The whole earth is at rest, [and] is quiet: they break forth into singing.

8. Yes, the fir-trees rejoice at you, [and] the cedars of Lebanon, [saying], Since you are laid low, no hewer has come up against us.

9. Sheol from beneath is moved for you to meet you at your coming; it stirs up the spirits of the dead for you, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

10. They will all answer and say to you, Have you also become weak as we? Have you become like us?

11. Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, [and] the noise of your viols: the worm is spread under you, and worms cover you.

12. How you have fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, that laid low the nations!

13. And you said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit on the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north;

14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.

15. Yet you will be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit.

16. Those who see you will gaze at you, they will consider you, [saying], Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms;

17. that made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew its cities; that did not let loose his prisoners to their home?

18. All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house.

19. But you are cast forth away from your tomb like a disgusting branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a dead body trodden under foot.

20. You will not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, you have slain your people; the seed of evildoers will not be named forever.

21. Prepare{+} slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers, that they do not rise up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.

22. And I will rise up against them, says Yahweh of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son's son, says Yahweh.

23. I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, says Yahweh of hosts.

24. Yahweh of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought, so it will come to pass; and as I have purposed, so it will stand:

25. that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains tread him under foot: then will his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder.

26. This is the purpose that is purposed on the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out on all the nations.

27. For Yahweh of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?

28. In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden.

29. Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent's root will come forth an adder, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.

30. And the firstborn of the poor will be shepherded, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and he will slay your remnant.

31. Howl, O gate; cry, O city; you are melted away, O Philistia, all of you; for there comes a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.

32. What then will one answer the messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her will the afflicted of his people take refuge.

## Isaiah 15

1. The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nothing; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nothing.

2. Ha-Bayith went up, and Dibon, to the high places to weep: Moab wails over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off.

3. In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one wails, weeping abundantly.

4. And Heshbon cries out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even to Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles inside him.

5. My heart cries out for Moab; her nobles [flee] to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.

6. For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.

7. Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, they will carry away over the brook of the willows.

8. For the cry has gone round about the borders of Moab; its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer-elim.

9. For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on them of Moab that escape, and on the remnant of the land.

## Isaiah 16

1. Send{+} the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.

2. For it will be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.

3. Give counsel, execute justice; make your shade as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; don't betray the fugitive.

4. Let my outcasts dwell with you; as for Moab, be a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nothing, destruction ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

5. And a throne will be established in loving-kindness; and one will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.

6. We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud; even of his arrogance, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nothing.

7. Therefore Moab will wail for Moab, everyone will wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth you{+} will mourn, completely stricken.

8. For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.

9. Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will soak you with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the [battle] shout is fallen.

10. And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise: no treader will tread out wine in the presses; I have made the [vintage] shout to cease.

11. Therefore my insides sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-heres.

12. And it will come to pass, when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and will come to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.

13. This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.

14. But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and of no account.

## Isaiah 17

1. The burden of Damascus. Look, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.

2. The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they will be for flocks, which will lie down, and none will make them afraid.

3. And the fortress will cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria; they will be as the glory of the sons of Israel, says Yahweh of hosts.

4. And it will come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will wax lean.

5. And it will be as when one gathers the harvest of standing grain, and his arm reaps the ears; yes, it will be as when one gleans ears in the valley of Rephaim.

6. Yet there will be left in it gleanings, as the shaking of an olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree, says Yahweh, the God of Israel.

7. In that day man will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

8. And they will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither will they have respect to that which their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images.

9. In that day their strong cities will be as the forsaken places in the forest and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the sons of Israel; and it will be a desolation.

10. For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and haven't been mindful of the rock of your strength; therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set it with strange slips.

11. In the day of your planting you hedge it in, and in the morning you make your seed to blossom; but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

12. Ah, the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!

13. The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.

14. At evening, look, terror; [and] before the morning they are not. This is the portion of those who despoil us, and the lot of those who rob us.

## Isaiah 18

1. Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;

2. that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters, [saying], Go, you{+} swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that metes out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide!

3. All you{+} inhabitants of the world, and you{+} who stay on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see{+}; and when the trumpet is blown, hear{+}.

4. For thus has Yahweh said to me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

5. For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches he will take away [and] cut down.

6. They will be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth will winter on them.

7. In that time will a present be brought to Yahweh of hosts from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that metes out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Yahweh of hosts, the mount Zion.

## Isaiah 19

1. The burden of Egypt. Look, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt in the midst of it.

2. And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they will fight a man against his brother, and a man against his fellow man; city against city, [and] kingdom against kingdom.

3. And the spirit of Egypt will fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy its counsel: and they will seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to the spiritists, and to the wizards.

4. And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king will rule over them, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.

5. And the waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.

6. And the rivers will become foul; the streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags will wither away.

7. The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.

8. And the fishers will lament, and all those who cast angle into the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.

9. Moreover those who work in combed flax will be confounded, and the weavers will grow pale.

10. And the weavers will be broken in pieces; all those who work for wages [will be] grieved in soul.

11. The princes of Zoan are completely foolish; the counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish: how do you{+} say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

12. Where then are your wise men? And let them tell you now if they know what Yahweh of hosts has purposed concerning Egypt.

13. The princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.

14. Yahweh has mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work of her, as a drunk man staggers in his vomit.

15. Neither will there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.

16. In that day the Egyptians will be like women; and they will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of hosts, which he shakes over them.

17. And the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt; everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the purpose of Yahweh of hosts, which he purposes against it.

18. In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of hosts; one will be called The City of the Sun.

19. In that day there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to Yahweh.

20. And it will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior, and a defender, and he will deliver them.

21. And Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day; yes, they will worship with sacrifice and oblation, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.

22. And Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing; and they will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.

23. In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.

24. In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;

25. for Yahweh of hosts has blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.

## Isaiah 20

1. In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;

2. at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put your sandal from off your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

3. And Yahweh said, Like my slave Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia;

4. so will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

5. And they will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

6. And the inhabitant of this coast-land will say in that day, Look, such is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and we, how shall we escape?

## Isaiah 21

1. The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.

2. A grievous vision is declared to me; the betrayer betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all her sighing I have made to cease.

3. Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold on me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I can't hear; I am dismayed so that I can't see.

4. My heart flutters, horror has frightened me; the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.

5. They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, you{+} princes, anoint the shield.

6. For thus has the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he sees:

7. and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he will listen diligently with much heed.

8. And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and am set in my ward whole nights;

9. and, look, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken to the ground.

10. O you my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you{+}.

11. The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

12. The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night: if you{+} will inquire, inquire{+}: turn{+}, come{+}.

13. The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you{+} will lodge, O you{+} caravans of Dedanites.

14. To him who was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.

15. For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

16. For thus has the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will fail;

17. and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.

## Isaiah 22

1. The burden of the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?

2. O you who are full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.

3. All your rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all who were found of you were bound together; they fled far off.

4. Therefore I said, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; don't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

5. For it is a day of discomfiture, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.

6. And Elam bore the quiver, with chariots of man [and] horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.

7. And it came to pass, that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.

8. And he took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.

9. And you{+} saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and you{+} gathered together the waters of the lower pool;

10. and you{+} numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you{+} broke down the houses to fortify the wall;

11. you{+} also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you{+} didn't look to him who had done this, neither had you{+} respect to him who purposed it long ago.

12. And in that day the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

13. but saw joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.

14. And Yahweh of hosts revealed himself in my ears, Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you{+} until you{+} die, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.

15. Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, [and say],

16. What do you have here? And whom do you have here, that you have hewed yourself out here a tomb? Hewing himself out a tomb on high, graving a habitation for himself in the rock!

17. Look, Yahweh will hurl you away violently, O [prominent] man, and he will wrap you up closely.

18. He will surely wind you round and round, [and toss you] like a ball into a large country; there you will die, and there will be the chariots of your glory, you shame of your lord's house.

19. And I will thrust you from your office; and from your station he will pull you down.

20. And it will come to pass in that day, that I will call my slave Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

21. and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt, and I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

22. And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; and he will open, and none will shut; and he will shut, and none will open.

23. And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.

24. And they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.

25. In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, will the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it will be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was on it will be cut off; for Yahweh has spoken it.

## Isaiah 23

1. The burden of Tyre. Howl, you{+} ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no access: from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.

2. Be still, you{+} inhabitants of the coast, O merchants of Sidon, your messengers passed over the sea.

3. And on great waters the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue; and she was the mart of nations.

4. Be ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I haven't travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.

5. When the report comes to Egypt, they will be very pained at the report of Tyre.

6. Pass{+} over to Tarshish; wail, you{+} inhabitants of the coast.

7. Is this your{+} joyous [city], whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far off to sojourn?

8. Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?

9. Yahweh of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.

10. Pass through your land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no restraint anymore.

11. He has stretched out his hand over the sea, he has shaken the kingdoms: Yahweh has given commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy its strongholds.

12. And he said, You will no more rejoice, O you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon: arise, pass over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest.

13. Look, the land of the Chaldeans: this people was not; the Assyrian founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness; they set up their towers; they overthrew its palaces; they made it a ruin.

14. Howl, you{+} ships of Tarshish; for your{+} stronghold is laid waste.

15. And it will come to pass in that day, that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute.

16. Take a harp, go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.

17. And it will come to pass after the end of seventy years, that Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she will return to her hire, and will prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.

18. And her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh: it will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

## Isaiah 24

1. Look, Yahweh makes the earth empty, and makes it waste, and turns it upside down, and scatters abroad its inhabitants.

2. And it will be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the male slave, so with his master; as with the female slave, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.

3. The earth will be completely emptied, and completely laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.

4. The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the lofty people of the earth languish.

5. The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.

6. Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell in it are found guilty: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few of common man are left.

7. The new wine mourns, the vine languishes, all the merry-hearted sigh.

8. The mirth of tabrets ceases, the noise of those who rejoice ends, the joy of the harp ceases.

9. They will not drink wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.

10. The waste city is broken down; every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

11. There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

12. In the city is left desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.

13. For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.

14. These will lift up their voice, they will shout; for the majesty of Yahweh they cry aloud from the sea.

15. Therefore glorify{+} Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.

16. From the uttermost part of the earth we have heard songs: Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! The betrayers have betrayed; yes, the betrayers have totally betrayed.

17. Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, O inhabitant of the earth.

18. And it will come to pass, that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.

19. The earth is completely broken, the earth is rent apart, the earth is shaken violently.

20. The earth will stagger like a drunk man, and will sway to and fro like a hammock; and its transgression will be heavy on it, and it will fall, and not rise again.

21. And it will come to pass in that day, that Yahweh will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.

22. And they will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.

23. Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of hosts will reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory.

## Isaiah 25

1. O Yahweh, you are my God; I will exalt you, I will praise your name; for you have done wonderful things, [even] counsels of old, in faithfulness [and] truth.

2. For you have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it will never be built.

3. Therefore will a strong people glorify you; a city of terrible nations will fear you.

4. For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

5. As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones will be brought low.

6. And in this mountain Yahweh of hosts will make to all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

7. And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.

8. He has swallowed up death forever; and the Sovereign Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people he will take away from off all the earth: for Yahweh has spoken it.

9. And it will be said in that day, Look, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Yahweh; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

10. For in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest; and Moab will be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.

11. And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of it, as he who swims spreads forth [his hands] to swim; but [Yahweh] will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.

12. And the high fortress of your walls he has brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.

## Isaiah 26

1. In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: we have a strong city; salvation he will appoint for walls and bulwarks.

2. Open{+} the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps faith may enter in.

3. You will keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] sustained [by you]; because he trusts in you.

4. Trust{+} in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting rock.

5. For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city: he lays it low, he lays it low even to the ground; he brings it even to the dust.

6. The foot will tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.

7. The way of the just is uprightness: you who are upright direct the path of the just.

8. Yes, in the way of your judgments, O Yahweh, we have waited for you; to your name, even to your memorial [name], is the desire of our soul.

9. With my soul I have desired you in the night; yes, with my spirit inside me I will seek you earnestly: for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

10. Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see the majesty of Yahweh.

11. Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don't see: but they will see [your] zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yes, fire will devour your adversaries.

12. Yahweh, you will appoint peace for us; for you have also wrought all our works for us.

13. O Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us; but by you only we will make mention of your name.

14. [They are] spirits of the dead, they will not live; [they are] deceased, they will not rise: therefore you have visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.

15. You have increased the nation, O Yahweh, you have increased the nation; you are glorified; you have enlarged all the borders of the land.

16. Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you; they poured out a prayer [when] your chastening was on them.

17. Like a woman pregnant, that draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so we have been before you, O Yahweh.

18. We have been pregnant, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we haven't wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

19. Your dead will live; my dead bodies will arise. Awake and sing, you{+} who stay in the dust; for your dew is [as] the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth the spirits of the dead.

20. Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself for a little moment, until the indignation has passed by.

21. For, look, Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also will disclose her blood, and will no more cover her slain.

## Isaiah 27

1. In that day Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea.

2. In that day: A pleasant vineyard, sing{+} to it.

3. I Yahweh am its keeper; I will water it every moment: or else any will hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

4. Wrath is not in me: Oh that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march on them, I would burn them together.

5. Otherwise let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; [yes], let him make peace with me.

6. In days to come Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and bud; and they will fill the face of the world with fruit.

7. Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they slain according to the slaughter of those who were slain by them?

8. In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them; he has removed [them] with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.

9. Therefore by this will the iniquity of Jacob be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, [so that] the Asherim and the sun-images will rise no more.

10. For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there the calf will feed, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.

11. When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off; the women will come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.

12. And it will come to pass in that day, that Yahweh will beat off [his fruit] from the flood of the River to the brook of Egypt; and you{+} will be gathered one by one, O you{+} sons of Israel.

13. And it will come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet will be blown; and they will come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 28

1. Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome with wine!

2. Look, the Lord has a mighty and strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast down to the earth with the hand.

3. The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot:

4. and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, will be as the first-ripe fig before the summer; which when he who looks on it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.

5. In that day will Yahweh of hosts become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people;

6. and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

7. And even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

8. For all tables are full of vomit [and] filthiness, [so that there is] no place [clean].

9. Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?

10. For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.

11. No, but by [men of] strange lips and with another tongue he will speak to this people;

12. to whom he said, This is the rest, give{+} rest to him who is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.

13. Therefore will the word of Yahweh be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

14. Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} scoffers, that rule this people who is in Jerusalem:

15. Because you{+} have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we are at agreement with Sheol; when the overflowing scourge will pass through, it will not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood we have hid ourselves:

16. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-[stone] of sure foundation: he who believes will not be caused to flee.

17. And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding-place.

18. And your{+} covenant with death will be annulled, and your{+} agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overflowing scourge will pass through, then you{+} will be trodden down by it.

19. As often as it passes through, it will take you{+}; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night: and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.

20. For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.

21. For Yahweh will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

22. Now therefore don't be{+} scoffers, or else your{+} bonds will be made strong; for a decree of destruction I have heard from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, on the whole earth.

23. Give{+} ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.

24. Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he [continually] open and harrow his ground?

25. When he has leveled its face, does he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cumin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its border?

26. For his God instructs him aright, [and] teaches him.

27. For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp [threshing] instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about on the cumin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cumin with a rod.

28. Bread [grain] is ground; for he will not always be threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he does not grind it.

29. This also comes forth from Yahweh of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.

## Isaiah 29

1. Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add{+} year to year; let the feasts come round:

2. then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation; and she will be to me as Ariel.

3. And I will encamp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against you.

4. And you will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground, and your speech will be low out of the dust; and your voice will be as a spirit out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.

5. But the multitude of your strangers will be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passes away: yes, it will be suddenly in an instant.

6. She will be visited of Yahweh of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.

7. And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, will be as a dream, a vision of the night.

8. And it will be as when a hungry man dreams, and, look, he eats; but he awakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, look, he drinks; but he awakes, and, look, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so will the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.

9. Tarry{+} and wonder; take your{+} pleasure and be blind: they are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

10. For Yahweh has poured out on you{+} the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your{+} eyes, the prophets; and your{+} heads, the seers, he has covered.

11. And all vision has become to you{+} as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you; and he says, I can't, for it is sealed:

12. and the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you; and he says, I am not learned.

13. And the Lord said, Since this people draw near [to me], and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught [to them];

14. therefore, look, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hid.

15. Woe to those who hide deep their counsel from Yahweh, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who sees us? And who knows us?

16. You{+} turn things upside down! Will the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him who made it, He didn't make me; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?

17. Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be esteemed as a forest?

18. And in that day the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.

19. The meek also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among man will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

20. For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who watch for iniquity are cut off;

21. who make man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.

22. Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob will not now be ashamed, neither will his face now wax pale.

23. But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name; yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

24. They also that err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will receive instruction.

## Isaiah 30

1. Woe to the rebellious sons, says Yahweh, that take counsel, but not of me; and that make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,

2. that set out to go down into Egypt, and haven't asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!

3. Therefore will the strength of Pharaoh be your{+} shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your{+} confusion.

4. For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.

5. They will all be ashamed because of a people who can't profit them, who are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

6. The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who will not profit [them].

7. For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose: therefore I have called her Rahab that sits still.

8. Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.

9. For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the law of Yahweh;

10. that say to the seers, Don't see; and to the prophets, Don't prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits,

11. get{+} out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

12. Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you{+} despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on them;

13. therefore this iniquity will be to you{+} as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.

14. And he will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there will not be found among its pieces a sherd with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.

15. For thus said the Sovereign Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest you{+} will be saved; in quietness and in confidence will be your{+} strength. And you{+} would not:

16. but you{+} said, No, for we will flee on horses; therefore you{+} will flee: and, We will ride on the swift; therefore those who pursue you{+} will be swift.

17. A thousand together [will flee] at the threat of one; at the threat of five you{+} will flee: until you{+} are left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.

18. And therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you{+}; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you{+}: for Yahweh is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.

19. For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; you will weep no more; he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry; when he will hear, he will answer you.

20. And though the Lord gives you{+} the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers will not be hidden anymore, but your eyes will see your teachers;

21. and your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk{+} in it; when you{+} turn to the right hand, and when you{+} turn to the left.

22. And you{+} will defile the overlaying of your graven images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold: you will cast them away as a menstrual cloth; you will say to it, Get away from here.

23. And he will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it will be fat and plenteous. In that day your cattle will be shepherded in large pastures;

24. the oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory fodder, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.

25. And there will be on every lofty mountain, and on every high hill, brooks [and] streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

26. Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds up the hurt of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.

27. Look, the name of Yahweh comes from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;

28. and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causes to err [will be] in the jaws of the peoples.

29. You{+} will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come to the mountain of Yahweh, to the Rock of Israel.

30. And Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the coming down of his arm, with the indignation of [his] anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.

31. For through the voice of Yahweh will the Assyrian be dismayed; with his rod he will strike [him].

32. And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Yahweh will lay on him, will be with [the sound of] tabrets and harps; and in battles with the brandishing [of his arm] he will fight with them.

33. For a Topheth is prepared of old; yes, for the king it is made ready; he has made it deep and large; its pile is fire and much wood; the breath of Yahweh, like a stream of brimstone, kindles it.

## Isaiah 31

1. Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they don't look to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Yahweh!

2. Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of those who work iniquity.

3. Now Egypt is man, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Yahweh will stretch out his hand, both he who helps will stumble, and he who is helped will fall, and all of them will be consumed together.

4. For thus says Yahweh to me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds are called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Yahweh of hosts come down to fight on mount Zion, and on its hill.

5. As birds hovering, so will Yahweh of hosts protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver [it], he will pass over and preserve [it].

6. Turn{+} to him from whom you{+} have deeply revolted, O sons of Israel.

7. For in that day they will cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your{+} own hands have made to you{+} for a sin.

8. And the Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of a man; and the sword, not of man, will devour him; and he will flee from the sword, and his young men will become subject to slave labor.

9. And his rock will pass away by reason of terror, and his princes will be dismayed at the ensign, says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 32

1. Look, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule in justice.

2. And a man will be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.

3. And the eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who hear will listen.

4. And the heart of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.

5. The fool will no more be called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.

6. For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to do profaneness, and to utter error against Yahweh, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

7. And the instruments of the churl are evil: he devises wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaks right.

8. But the noble devises noble things; and in noble things he will continue.

9. Rise up, you{+} women who are at ease, [and] hear my voice; you{+} careless daughters, give ear to my speech.

10. For days beyond a year you{+} will be troubled, you{+} careless women; for the vintage will fail, the ingathering will not come.

11. Tremble, you{+} women who are at ease; be troubled, you{+} careless ones; strip{+}, and make yourselves bare, and gird [sackcloth] on your{+} loins.

12. They will strike on the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

13. On the land of my people thorns and briers will come up; yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city.

14. For the palace will be forsaken; the populous city will be deserted; the hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever, a joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;

15. until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is esteemed as a forest.

16. Then justice will stay in the wilderness; and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.

17. And the work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.

18. And my people will remain in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.

19. But it will hail in the downfall of the forest; and the city will be completely laid low.

20. Blessed are you{+} who sow beside all waters, who send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.

## Isaiah 33

1. Woe to you who destroy, and you were not destroyed; and who betray, and they did not betray you! When you have ceased to destroy, you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of betraying, they will betray you.

2. O Yahweh, be gracious to us; we have waited for you: be the arm [which attacks] them every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

3. At the noise of the tumult the peoples have fled; at the lifting up of yourself the nations have scattered.

4. And your{+} spoil will be gathered [as] the caterpillar gathers: as locusts leap will men leap on it.

5. Yahweh is exalted; for he stays on high: he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

6. And there will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Yahweh is his treasure.

7. Look, I will appear to them; they cry out in the streets; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

8. The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: [the enemy] has broken the covenant, he has despised the witnesses, he does not regard common man.

9. The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their leaves].

10. Now I will arise, says Yahweh; now I will lift up myself; now I will be exalted.

11. You{+} will be pregnant with chaff, you{+} will give birth to stubble: your{+} breath is a fire that will devour you{+}.

12. And the peoples will be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.

13. Hear, you{+} who are far off, what I have done; and, you{+} who are near, acknowledge my might.

14. The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?

15. He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from taking a bribe, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking on evil:

16. He will stay on high; his place of defense will be the munitions of rocks; his bread will be given [him]; his waters will be sure.

17. Your eyes will see the king in his beauty: they will look at a land that reaches far.

18. Your heart will muse on the terror: Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed [the tribute]? Where is he who counted the towers?

19. You will not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that you can't comprehend, of a strange tongue that you can't understand.

20. Look at Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes will see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that will not be removed, the stakes of which will never be plucked up, neither will any of its cords be broken.

21. But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, in which will go no galley with oars, neither will gallant ship pass by it.

22. For Yahweh is our judge, Yahweh is our lawgiver, Yahweh is our king; he will save us.

23. Your tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then the prey of a great spoil was divided; the lame took the prey.

24. And the neighbor will not say, I am sick: the people who dwell in it will be forgiven their iniquity.

## Isaiah 34

1. Come near, you{+} nations, to hear; and listen, you{+} peoples: let the earth hear, and the fullness of it; the world, and all things that come forth from it.

2. For Yahweh has indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he has completely destroyed them, he has delivered them to the slaughter.

3. Their slain also will be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies will come up; and the mountains will be melted with their blood.

4. And all the host of heaven will be dissolved, and the heavens will be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host will fade away, as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as a fading [leaf] from the fig-tree.

5. For my sword has drank its fill in heaven: look, it will come down on Edom, and on the people of my curse, to judgment.

6. The sword of Yahweh is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

7. And the wild-oxen will come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land will be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

8. For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.

9. And the streams of [Edom] will be turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land will become burning pitch.

10. It will not be quenched night nor day; its smoke will go up forever; from generation to generation it will lie waste; none will pass through it forever and ever.

11. But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it; and the owl and the raven will stay in it: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.

12. They will call its nobles to the kingdom, but none will be there; and all its princes will be nothing.

13. And thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it will be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.

14. And the wild beasts of the desert will meet with the wolves, and the wild goat will cry to his companion; yes, the night-monster will settle there, and will find her a place of rest.

15. There will the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yes, there will the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.

16. Seek{+} out of the Book of Yahweh, and read: no one of these will be missing, none will want her mate; for my mouth, it has commanded, and his Spirit, it has gathered them.

17. And he has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it to them by line: they will possess it forever; from generation to generation they will stay in it.

## Isaiah 35

1. The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; and the desert will rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

2. It will blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they will see the glory of Yahweh, the excellency of our God.

3. Strengthen{+} the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

4. Say to those who are of a fearful heart, Be strong, don't be afraid: look, your{+} God will come [with] vengeance, [with] the recompense of God; he will come and save you{+}.

5. Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

6. Then will the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the mute will sing; for in the wilderness will waters break out, and streams in the desert.

7. And the glowing sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of the jackals' resting place, will be grass with reeds and rushes.

8. And a highway will be there, and a way, and it will be called The Way of Holiness; the unclean will not pass over it; but it will be for [the redeemed]: the wayfaring men, yes fools, will not err [in it].

9. No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous beast go up on it; they will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk [there]:

10. and the ransomed of Yahweh will return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy will be on their heads: they will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.

## Isaiah 36

1. Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.

2. And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.

3. Then came forth to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.

4. And Rabshakeh said to them, Say{+} now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?

5. I say, [your] counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?

6. Look, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.

7. But if you say to me, We trust in Yahweh our God: isn't that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You{+} will worship before this altar?

8. Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.

9. How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's slaves, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

10. And have I now come up without Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

11. Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your slaves in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don't speak to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.

12. But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? [Has he] not [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own feces, and to drink their own urine with you{+}.

13. Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear{+} the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

14. Thus says the king, Don't let Hezekiah deceive you{+}; for he will not be able to deliver you{+}:

15. neither let Hezekiah make you{+} trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

16. Don't listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your{+} peace with me, and come out to me; and eat{+} every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink{+} every one the waters of his own cistern;

17. until I come and take you{+} away to a land like your{+} own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

18. Beware that you don't let Hezekiah persuade you{+}, saying, Yahweh will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

19. Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

20. Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

21. But they held their peace, and did not answer him a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, Don't answer him.

22. Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

## Isaiah 37

1. And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.

2. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

3. And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of disgrace; for the sons have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

4. It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard: therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant who is left.

5. So the slaves of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said to them, Thus you{+} will say to your{+} master, Thus says Yahweh, Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the attendants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

7. Look, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear [some] news, and will return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

8. So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.

9. And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to fight against you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus you{+} will speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11. Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them completely: and will you be delivered?

12. Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

13. Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,

16. O Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, who sits [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.

17. Incline your ear, O Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, O Yahweh, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.

18. Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries,

19. and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of man's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.

20. Now therefore, O Yahweh our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.

21. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

22. this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.

23. Whom have you defied and blasphemed? And against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? [Even] against the Holy One of Israel.

24. By your slaves you have defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir-trees; and I will enter into its farthest height, its forest park;

25. I have dug and drank water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.

26. Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.

27. Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, which is blighted before the east wind.

28. But I know your rising up and your sitting down, and your going out and your coming in, and your raging against me.

29. Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.

30. And this will be the sign to you: you{+} will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow{+}, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

31. And the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

32. For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who will escape. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will perform this.

33. Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.

34. By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city, says Yahweh.

35. For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my slave David's sake.

36. And the angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000; and when men arose early in the morning, look, these were all dead bodies.

37. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

38. And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

## Isaiah 38

1. In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order; for you will die, and not live.

2. Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh,

3. and said, Remember now, O Yahweh, I urge you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept intensely.

4. Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: look, I will add to your days fifteen years.

6. And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.

7. And this will be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken:

8. Look, I will move back the shadow of the steps, which has gone down on the steps from the Upper House of Ahaz - [I will move back] the sun backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the steps on which it had gone down.

9. The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.

10. I said, In the noontide of my days I will go into the gates of Sheol: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

11. I said, I will not see Yah, Yah in the land of the living: I will not see man anymore with the inhabitants of this world.

12. My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd's tent: I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the loom: From day even to night you will make an end of me.

13. I quieted [myself] until morning; as a lion, so he breaks all my bones: From day even to night you will make an end of me.

14. Like a swallow [or] a crane, so I chattered; I moaned as a dove; my eyes fail [with looking] upward: O Lord, I am oppressed, be my surety.

15. What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it: I will go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.

16. O Lord, by these things men live; And wholly in them is the life of my spirit: Therefore you recover me, and make me to live.

17. Look, [it was] for [my] peace [that] I had great bitterness: But you have in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; For you have cast all my sins behind your back.

18. For Sheol can't praise you, death can't celebrate you: Those who go down into the pit can't hope for your truth.

19. The living, the living, he will praise you, as I do this day: The father to the sons will make known your truth.

20. Yahweh is [ready] to save me: Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments All the days of our life in the house of Yahweh.

## Isaiah 39

1. At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.

2. And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.

3. Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And where did they come to you from? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.

4. Then he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house they have seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I haven't shown them.

5. Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh of hosts:

6. Look, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, will be carried to Babylon: nothing will be left, says Yahweh.

7. And of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, they will take away; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

8. Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good. He said moreover, For there will be peace and truth in my days.

## Isaiah 40

1. Comfort{+}, comfort{+} my people, says your{+} God.

2. Speak{+} comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Yahweh's hand double for all her sins.

3. The voice of one who cries, Prepare{+} in the wilderness the way of Yahweh; make level in the desert a highway for our God.

4. Every valley will be exalted, and every mountain and hill will be made low; and the uneven will be made level, and the rough places a plain:

5. and the glory of Yahweh will be revealed, and all flesh will see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.

6. The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field.

7. The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of Yahweh blows on it; surely the people are grass.

8. The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand forever.

9. O you who tell good news to Zion, get yourself up on a high mountain; O you who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, don't be afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Look, your{+} God!

10. Look, the Sovereign Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Look, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.

11. Like a shepherd, he will shepherd his flock; he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom; [and] will gently lead those that have their young.

12. Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

13. Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, or being his counselor has taught him?

14. With whom did he take counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?

15. Look, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Look, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.

16. And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering.

17. All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.

18. To whom then will you{+} liken God? Or what likeness will you{+} compare to him?

19. The image, a workman has cast [it], and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts [for it] silver chains.

20. He who is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks to him a skillful workman to set up a graven image, that will not be moved.

21. Have you{+} not known? Have you{+} not heard? Has it not been told to you{+} from the beginning? Have you{+} not understood from the foundations of the earth?

22. [It is] he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are as grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in;

23. who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the earth as vanity.

24. Yes, they have not been planted; yes, they have not been sown; yes, their stock has not taken root in the earth: moreover he blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.

25. To whom then will you{+} liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? says the Holy One.

26. Lift up your{+} eyes on high, and see who has created these, that brings out their host by number; he calls them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.

27. Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from Yahweh, and the justice [due] to me has passed away from my God?

28. Haven't you known? Haven't you heard? The everlasting God, Yahweh, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.

29. He gives power to the faint; and to him who has no might he increases strength.

30. Even the youths will faint and be weary, and the young men will completely fall:

31. but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength; they will mount up with wings as eagles; they will run, and not be weary; they will walk, and not faint.

## Isaiah 41

1. Keep silent before me, O islands; and let the peoples renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment.

2. Who has raised up one from the east, whom he calls in righteousness to his foot? He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; he gives them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.

3. He pursues them, and passes on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.

4. Who has wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last, I am he.

5. The isles have seen, and fear; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.

6. A man helps his fellow man; and says to his brother, Be of good courage.

7. So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, [and] he who smoothes with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fastens it with nails, that it should not be moved.

8. But you, Israel, my slave, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,

9. you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from its corners, and said to you, You are my slave, I have chosen you and not cast you away;

10. Don't be afraid, for I am with you; don't be dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.

11. Look, all those who are incensed against you will be put to shame and confounded: those who strive with you will be as nothing, and will perish.

12. You will seek them, and will not find them, even those who contend with you: those who war against you will be as nothing, and as a thing of nothing.

13. For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, Don't be afraid; I will help you.

14. Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you{+} vermin Israel; I will help you, says Yahweh, and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

15. Look, I have made you [to be] a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; you will thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and will make the hills as chaff.

16. You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, and the whirlwind will scatter them; and you will rejoice in Yahweh, you will glory in the Holy One of Israel.

17. The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst; I, Yahweh, will answer them, I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

18. I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

19. I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:

20. that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.

21. Produce your{+} cause, says Yahweh; bring forth your{+} strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.

22. Let them bring forth, and declare to us what will happen: declare{+} the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.

23. Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you{+} are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed and watch it together.

24. Look, you{+} are of nothing, and your{+} work is of nothing; he who chooses you{+} is disgusting.

25. I have raised up one from the north, and he has come; from the rising of the sun one who calls on my name: and he will trample rulers as mortar, and as the potter treads clay.

26. Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know? And formerly, that we may say, [He is] right? Yes, there is none who declares, yes, there is none who shows, yes, there is none who hears your{+} words.

27. [I am the] first [who says] to Zion, Look, look at them; and I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good news.

28. And when I look, there is no man: even among them there is no counselor, who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.

29. Look, all of them, their works are vanity [and] nothing; their molten images are wind and confusion.

## Isaiah 42

1. Look, my slave, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delights: I have put my Spirit on him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.

2. He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.

3. A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench: he will bring forth justice in truth.

4. He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set justice in the earth; and the isles will wait for his instructions.

5. Thus says God Yahweh, he who created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he who spread abroad the earth and that which comes out of it; he who gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to those who walk in it:

6. I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

7. to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.

8. I am Yahweh, that is my name; and my glory I will not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

9. Look, the former things have come to pass, and I declare new things; before they spring forth I tell you{+} of them.

10. Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; you{+} who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, the isles, and its inhabitants.

11. Let the wilderness and its cities lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

12. Let them give glory to Yahweh, and declare his praise in the islands.

13. Yahweh will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up [his] zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yes, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies.

14. I have held my peace for a long time; I have been still, and refrained myself: [now] I will cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.

15. I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.

16. And I will bring the blind by a way that they don't know; in paths that they don't know I will lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things I will do, and I will not forsake them.

17. They will be turned back, they will be completely put to shame, who trust in graven images, who say to molten images, You{+} are our gods.

18. Hear, you{+} deaf; and look, you{+} blind, that you{+} may see.

19. Who is blind, but my slave? Or deaf, as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace [with me], and blind as Yahweh's slave?

20. You have seen many things, but you don't retain; his ears are open, but he doesn't hear.

21. It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.

22. But this is a people robbed and plundered; all of them are snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none says, Restore.

23. Who is there among you{+} who will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?

24. Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not Yahweh? He against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient to his law.

25. Therefore he poured on him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he didn't know; and it burned him, yet he didn't lay it to heart.

## Isaiah 43

1. But now thus says Yahweh who created you, O Jacob, and he who formed you, O Israel: Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name, you are mine.

2. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overflow you: when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, neither will the flame kindle on you.

3. For I am Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in your stead.

4. Since you have been precious in my sight, [and] honorable, and I have loved you; therefore I will give man in your stead, and peoples instead of your life.

5. Don't be afraid; for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;

6. I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Don't keep back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;

7. everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made.

8. Bring forth the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.

9. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

10. You{+} are my witnesses, says Yahweh, and my slave whom I have chosen; that you{+} may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither will there be after me.

11. I, even I, am Yahweh; and besides me there is no savior.

12. I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shown; and there was no strange [god] among you{+}: therefore you{+} are my witnesses, says Yahweh, and I am God.

13. Yes, since the day was, I am he; and there is none who can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it?

14. Thus says Yahweh, your{+} Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your{+} sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.

15. I am Yahweh, your{+} Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your{+} King.

16. Thus says Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;

17. who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they will not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick):

18. Don't remember{+} the former things, neither consider the things of old.

19. Look, I will do a new thing; now it will spring forth; will you{+} not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and paths in the desert.

20. The beasts of the field will honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,

21. the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.

22. Yet you haven't called on me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel.

23. You haven't brought me of your sheep for burnt-offerings; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices. I haven't burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense.

24. You have bought me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened me with your sins, you have wearied me with your iniquities.

25. I, I am he, who blots out your transgressions for my own sake; and I will not remember your sins.

26. Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set you forth [your cause], that you may be justified.

27. Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed against me.

28. Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will give Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.

## Isaiah 44

1. Yet hear now, O Jacob my slave, and Israel, who I have chosen:

2. Thus says Yahweh who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you: Don't be afraid, O Jacob my slave; and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

3. For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:

4. and they will spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.

5. One will say, I am Yahweh's; and another will call the name of Jacob; and another will write with his hand, For Yahweh, and will name the name of Israel.

6. Thus says Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God.

7. And who is like me? Let him call and declare it, and set it in order for me, since my establishing the ancient people. And let them declare the things that are coming, and that will come to pass, to [those among] them.

8. Don't be{+} afraid, neither be scared: Have I not declared to you of old, and shown it? And you{+} are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Yes, there is no Rock; I don't know any.

9. Those who fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and the things that they delight in will not profit; and their own witnesses don't see, nor know: that they may be put to shame.

10. Who has fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?

11. Look, all his partners will be put to shame; and the workmen, they are of man: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they will fear, they will be put to shame together.

12. The blacksmith [makes] an ax, and works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm: yes, he is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.

13. The carpenter stretches out a line; he marks it out with a pencil; he shapes it with planes, and he marks it out with the compasses, and shapes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of man, to dwell in a house.

14. He cuts down cedars, and takes the holm-tree and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest: he plants a fir-tree, and the rain nourishes it.

15. Then it will be for man to burn; and he takes of it, and warms himself; yes, he kindles it, and bakes bread: yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it a graven image, and falls down to it.

16. He burns part of it in the fire; with part of it he eats flesh; he roasts roast, and is satisfied; yes, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.

17. And its residue he makes a god, even his graven image; he falls down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me; for you are my god.

18. They don't know, neither do they consider: for he has shut their eyes, that they can't see; and their hearts, that they can't understand.

19. And none calls to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yes, I have also baked bread on its coals; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make its residue [into] a disgusting thing? Shall I fall down to a piece of wood?

20. He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside; and he can't deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?

21. Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel; for you are my slave: I have formed you; you are my slave: O Israel, you will not be forgotten of me.

22. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins: return to me; for I have redeemed you.

23. Sing, O you{+} heavens, for Yahweh has done it; shout, you{+} lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, you{+} mountains, O forest, and every tree in it: for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.

24. Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb: I am Yahweh, who makes all things; who stretches forth the heavens alone; who spreads abroad the earth (who is with me?);

25. who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes fortune-tellers insane; who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;

26. who confirms the word of his slave, and performs the counsel of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem, She will be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They will be built, and I will raise up their waste places;

27. who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;

28. who says of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and will perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She will be built; and of the temple, Your foundation will be laid.

## Isaiah 45

1. Thus says Yahweh to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and the gates will not be shut:

2. I will go before you, and make the rough places smooth; I will break in pieces the doors of bronze, and cut in sunder the bars of iron;

3. and I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that it is I, Yahweh, who call you by your name, even the God of Israel.

4. For Jacob my slave's sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you haven't known me.

5. I am Yahweh, and there is no other; besides me there is no God. I will gird you, though you haven't known me;

6. that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me: I am Yahweh, and there is no other.

7. I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I am Yahweh, that does all these things.

8. Trickle, you{+} heavens, from above, and the skies will pour down righteousness; the earth will open, and salvation will bud and righteousness will spring up together; I, Yahweh, have created it.

9. Woe to him who strives with his Maker! A potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Will the clay say to him who fashions it, What do you make? Or your work, He has no hands?

10. Woe to him who says to a father, What do you beget? Or to a woman, With what do you travail?

11. Thus says Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things that are to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command{+} me.

12. I have made the earth, and created man on it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host I have commanded.

13. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he will build my city, and he will let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, says Yahweh of hosts.

14. Thus says Yahweh, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you, and they will be yours: they will go after you, in chains they will come over; and they will fall down to you, they will make supplication to you, [saying], Surely God is in you; and there is no other, no [other] God.

15. Truly you are a God who hides yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

16. They will be put to shame, yes, confounded, all of them; they will go into confusion together who are makers of idols.

17. [But] Israel will be saved by Yahweh with an eternal salvation: you{+} will not be put to shame nor confounded forever without end.

18. For thus says Yahweh who created the heavens, the God who formed the earth and made it, who established it and did not create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited: I am Yahweh; and there is no other.

19. I haven't spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I didn't say to the seed of Jacob, Seek{+} me in vain: I, Yahweh, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

20. Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you{+} who have escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god that can't save.

21. Declare{+}, and bring [it] forth; yes, let them take counsel together: who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Haven't I, Yahweh? And there is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior; there is none besides me.

22. Look to me, and be{+} saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.

23. By myself I have sworn, the word has gone forth from my mouth [in] righteousness, and will not return, that to me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear.

24. Only in Yahweh, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength. One will come to him; and all those who were incensed against him will be put to shame.

25. In Yahweh will all the seed of Israel be justified, and will glory.

## Isaiah 46

1. Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the beasts, and on the cattle: the things that you{+} carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary [beast].

2. They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into captivity.

3. Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne [by me] from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;

4. and even to old age, I am he, and even to hoar hairs I will carry [you{+}]; I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry, and will deliver.

5. To whom will you{+} liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?

6. Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god; they fall down, yes, they worship.

7. They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it will not remove: yes, one may cry to it, yet it can't answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

8. Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O you{+} transgressors.

9. Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is no other; [I am] God, and there is none like me;

10. declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel will stand, and I will do all my pleasure;

11. calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.

12. Listen to me, you{+} stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:

13. I bring near my righteousness, it will not be far off, and my salvation will not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.

## Isaiah 47

1. Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you will no more be called tender and delicate.

2. Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.

3. Your nakedness will be uncovered, yes, your shame will be seen: I will take vengeance, and will not spare man.

4. Our Redeemer, Yahweh of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.

5. Sit silent, and get into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you will no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.

6. I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no mercy; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke.

7. And you said, I will be mistress forever; so that you did not lay these things to your heart, neither remembered the latter end of them.

8. Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, that sit securely, that say in your heart, I am, and there is no other besides me; I will not sit as a widow, neither will I know the loss of children:

9. but these two things will come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure they will come upon you, in the multitude of your witchcraft, and the great abundance of your magic words.

10. For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, None sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no other besides me.

11. Therefore will evil come upon you; you will not know its dawning: and mischief will fall on you; you will not be able to put it away: and desolation will come upon you suddenly, which you do not know.

12. Stand now with your magic words, and with the multitude of your witchcraft, in which you have labored from your youth; perhaps you will be able to profit, perhaps you may prevail.

13. You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let the astrologers stand up now and save you, those observing the stars for determining your horoscopes.

14. Look, they will be as stubble; the fire will burn them; they will not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it will not be charcoal for their bread, nor a fire to sit before.

15. Thus will the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth will wander every one to his quarter; there will be none to save you.

## Isaiah 48

1. Hear you{+} this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Yahweh, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness

2. (for they call themselves of the holy city, and lean on the God of Israel; Yahweh of hosts is his name):

3. I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.

4. Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow bronze;

5. therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it came to pass I showed it you; or else you will say, My idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.

6. You have heard it; look at all this; and you{+}, will you{+} not declare it? I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, which you haven't known.

7. They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day you did not hear them; or else you will say, Look, I knew them.

8. Yes, you didn't hear; yes, you didn't know; yes, from of old your ear wasn't opened: for I knew that you would be totally betraying, and were called a transgressor from the womb.

9. For my name's sake I will defer my anger, and for my praise I will refrain for you, that I don't cut you off.

10. Look, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.

11. For my own sake, for my own sake, I will do it; for how should I be profaned? And my glory I will not give to another.

12. Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I am also the last.

13. Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.

14. Assemble yourselves, all you{+}, and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom Yahweh loves will perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [will be on] the Chaldeans.

15. I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he will make his way prosperous.

16. Come{+} near to me, hear{+} this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there I am: and now the Sovereign Yahweh has sent me, and his Spirit.

17. Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.

18. Oh that you would have listened to my commandments! Then your peace would have been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:

19. your seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring from inside you like its grains: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.

20. Go{+} forth from Babylon, flee{+} from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare{+}, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say{+}, Yahweh has redeemed his slave Jacob.

21. And they didn't thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

22. There is no peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 49

1. Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you{+} peoples, from far: Yahweh has called me from the womb; from inside my mother he has made mention of my name:

2. and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he has hid me: and he has made me a polished shaft; in his quiver he has kept me close:

3. and he said to me, You are my slave; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.

4. But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely the justice [due] to me is with Yahweh, and my recompense with my God.

5. And now says Yahweh who formed me from the womb to be his slave, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered to him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God has become my strength);

6. yes, he says, It is too light a thing that you should be my slave to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.

7. Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, its Holy One, to a despised soul, to one who the nations are disgusted by, to a slave of rulers: Kings will see and arise; princes, and they will worship; because of Yahweh who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.

8. Thus says Yahweh, In an acceptable time I have answered you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you; and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages:

9. saying to those who are bound, Go forth; to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves. They will be shepherded in the ways, and on all bare heights will be their pasture.

10. They will not hunger nor thirst; neither will the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water he will guide them.

11. And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways will be exalted.

12. Look, these will come from far; and, look, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Syene.

13. Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for Yahweh has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted.

14. But Zion said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.

15. Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you.

16. Look, I have graven you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.

17. Your builders hurry more than your destroyers, and those who made you waste will go forth from you.

18. Lift up your eyes round about, and look at all these who gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says Yahweh, you will surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and gird yourself with them, like a bride.

19. For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you will be too strait for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.

20. The sons of your bereavement will yet say in your ears, The place is too strait for me; give a place to me that I may dwell.

21. Then you will say in your heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? And who has brought these up? Look, I was left alone; these, where were they?

22. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples; and they will bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.

23. And kings will be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they will bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you will know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me will not be put to shame.

24. Will the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be delivered?

25. But thus says Yahweh, Even the captives of the mighty will be taken away, and the prey of the terrible will be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your sons.

26. And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they will be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

## Isaiah 50

1. Thus says Yahweh, Where is the bill of your{+} mother's divorce, with which I have put her away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you{+}? Look, for your{+} iniquities you{+} were sold, and for your{+} transgressions your{+} mother was put away.

2. Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it can't redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Look, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.

3. I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

4. The Sovereign Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.

5. The Sovereign Yahweh has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.

6. I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.

7. For the Sovereign Yahweh will help me; therefore I have not been confounded: therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I will not be put to shame.

8. He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? Let us stand up together: who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.

9. Look, the Sovereign Yahweh will help me; who is he who will condemn me? Look, they will all wax old as a garment, the moth will eat them up.

10. Who is among you{+} that fears Yahweh, that obeys the voice of his slave? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of Yahweh, and rely on his God.

11. Look, all you{+} who kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk{+} in the flame of your{+} fire, and among the brands that you{+} have kindled. This you{+} will have of my hand: you{+} will lie down in a place of pain.

## Isaiah 51

1. Listen to me, you{+} who follow after righteousness, you{+} who seek Yahweh: look to the rock from where you{+} were cut, and to the hole of the pit from where you{+} were dug.

2. Look to Abraham your{+} father, and to Sarah that bore you{+}; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.

3. For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

4. Attend to me, O my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law will go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.

5. My righteousness is near, my salvation has gone forth, and my arms will judge the peoples; the isles will wait for me, and on my arm they will trust.

6. Lift up your{+} eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens will vanish away like smoke, and the earth will wax old like a garment; and those who dwell in it will die in like manner: but my salvation will be forever, and my righteousness will not be abolished.

7. Listen to me, you{+} who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; don't be{+} afraid of the reproach of common man, neither be{+} dismayed at their revilings.

8. For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations.

9. Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Yahweh; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is it not you who cut Rahab in pieces, that pierced the monster?

10. Is it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?

11. And the ransomed of Yahweh will return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy will be on their heads: they will obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and sighing will flee away.

12. I, even I, am he who comforts you{+}: who are you, that you are afraid of common man who will die, and of the son of man who will be made as grass;

13. and have forgotten Yahweh your Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?

14. The captive exile will speedily be loosed; and he will not die [and go down] into the pit, neither will his bread fail.

15. For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar: Yahweh of hosts is his name.

16. And I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are my people.

17. Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that have drank at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you have drank the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.

18. There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.

19. These two things have befallen you, who will bemoan you? Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; [with] whom shall I comfort you?

20. Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh, the rebuke of your God.

21. Therefore now hear this, you afflicted, and drunk, but now with wine:

22. Thus says your Sovereign Yahweh, and your God who pleads the cause of his people, Look, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; you will no more drink it again:

23. and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you and those who oppress you, that have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street, to those who go over.

## Isaiah 52

1. Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there will no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.

2. Shake yourself from the dust; arise, sit [on your throne], O Jerusalem: the bonds of your neck became loosened, O captive daughter of Zion.

3. For thus says Yahweh, You{+} were sold for nothing; and you{+} will be redeemed without money.

4. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there: and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.

5. Now therefore, what do I have here, says Yahweh, seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them howl, says Yahweh, and my name is blasphemed continually all the day.

6. Therefore my people will know my name: therefore [they will know] in that day that I am he who speaks; look, it is I.

7. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good [things], who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns!

8. The voice of your watchmen! They lift up the voice, together they sing; for they will see eye to eye, when Yahweh returns to Zion.

9. Break forth into joy, sing together, you{+} waste places of Jerusalem; for Yahweh has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.

10. Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

11. Depart{+}, depart{+}, go{+} out from there, touch no unclean thing; go{+} out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves, you{+} who bear the vessels of Yahweh.

12. For you{+} will not go out in a hurry, neither will you{+} go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you{+}; and the God of Israel will be your{+} rearward.

13. Look, my slave will deal wisely, he will be exalted and lifted up, and will be very high.

14. Just as many were astonished at you, so [is his] anointing more than a man, his appearance and form more than sons of man.

15. So he will sprinkle many nations; kings will shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told to them they will see; and that which they had not heard they will understand.

## Isaiah 53

1. Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?

2. For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor majesty; and when we see him, there is no appearance that we should desire him.

3. He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we did not esteem him.

4. Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck of God, and afflicted.

5. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.

6. All of us like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

7. He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute, so he didn't open his mouth.

8. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and who considered his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; because of the transgression of my people he was stricken to death.

9. And they made his grave with the wicked, and his tomb with the rich; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.

10. Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him who was made sick. If his soul makes an offering for sin, [then] he will see [his] seed, he will prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh will prosper in his hand.

11. He will see the light of the travail of his soul, [and] will be satisfied: by his knowledge will my righteous slave justify many; and he will bear their iniquities.

12. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he will divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for their sins.

## Isaiah 54

1. Sing, O barren, you who did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail: for more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married wife, says Yahweh.

2. Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations; do not spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.

3. For you will spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and your seed will possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

4. Don't be afraid; for you will not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you will not be put to shame: for you will forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.

5. For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he will be called the God of the whole earth.

6. For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, says your God.

7. For a small moment I have forsaken you; but with great mercies I will gather you.

8. In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving-kindness I will have mercy on you, says Yahweh your Redeemer.

9. For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah will no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.

10. For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my loving-kindness will not depart from you, neither will my covenant of peace be removed, says Yahweh who has mercy on you.

11. O you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, look, I will set your stones in fair colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.

12. And I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your border of precious stones.

13. And all your sons will be taught of Yahweh; and great will be the peace of your sons.

14. In righteousness you will be established: you will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; and from terror, for it will not come near you.

15. Look, they may gather together, but not by me: whoever will gather together against you will fall because of you.

16. Look, I have created the blacksmith that blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

17. No weapon that is formed against you will prosper; and every tongue that will rise against you in judgment you will condemn. This is the heritage of the slaves of Yahweh, and their righteousness which is of me, says Yahweh.

## Isaiah 55

1. Ho, everyone who thirsts, come{+} to the waters, and he who has no money; come{+}, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

2. Why do you{+} spend money for that which is not bread? And your{+} labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat{+} that which is good, and let your{+} soul delight itself in fatness.

3. Incline your{+} ear, and come to me; hear, and your{+} soul will live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you{+}, even the sure mercies of David.

4. Look, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.

5. Look, you will call a nation that you don't know; and a nation that didn't know you will run to you, because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.

6. Seek{+} Yahweh while he may be found; call{+} on him while he is near:

7. let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

8. For my thoughts are not your{+} thoughts, neither are your{+} ways my ways, says Yahweh.

9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your{+} ways, and my thoughts than your{+} thoughts.

10. For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;

11. so will my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it will not return to me void, but it will accomplish that which I please, and it will prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

12. For you{+} will go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills will break forth before you{+} into singing; and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands.

13. Instead of the thorn will come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier will come up the myrtle-tree: and it will be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.

## Isaiah 56

1. Thus says Yahweh, Keep{+} justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.

2. Blessed is [the] common man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast; that keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.

3. Neither let the foreigner, that has joined himself to Yahweh, speak, saying, Yahweh will surely separate me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Look, I am a dry tree.

4. For thus says Yahweh of the eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:

5. To him I will give in my house and inside my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that will not be cut off.

6. Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister to him, and to love the name of Yahweh, to be his slaves, everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant;

7. even them I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.

8. The Sovereign Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet I will gather [others] to him, besides his own who are gathered.

9. All you{+} beasts of the field, come to devour, [yes], all you{+} beasts in the forest.

10. His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they can't bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.

11. Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that can't understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.

12. Come{+}, [they say], I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow will be as this day, [a day] great beyond measure.

## Isaiah 57

1. The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come].

2. He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.

3. But draw near here, you{+} sons of the psychic, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute.

4. Against whom do you{+} sport yourselves? Against whom do you{+} make a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? Are you{+} not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,

5. you{+} who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?

6. Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; even to them you have poured a drink-offering, you have offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?

7. On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to offer sacrifice.

8. And behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial: for you have uncovered [yourself] to other than me, and have gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and you made a covenant with them: you have loved their bed, you have looked at the hand.

9. And you went to the king with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off, and debased yourself even to Sheol.

10. You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn't say, It is in vain: you found a quickening of your strength; therefore you were not faint.

11. And of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and haven't remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven't I held my peace even of long time, and you don't fear me?

12. I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they will not profit you.

13. When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind will take them, a breath will carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me will possess the land, and will inherit my holy mountain.

14. And he will say, Cast{+} up, cast{+} up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.

15. For thus says the high and lofty One who stays eternally, whose name is Holy: I stay in the high and holy place, and with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.

16. For I will not contend forever, neither will I always be angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made.

17. For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and struck him; I hid [my face] and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.

18. I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.

19. I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.

20. But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can't rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.

21. There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 58

1. Cry aloud, do not spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.

2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and did not forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.

3. Why have we fasted, [they say], and you don't see? [Why] have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge? Look, in the day of your{+} fast you{+} find [your{+} own] pleasure, and exact all your{+} labors.

4. Look, you{+} fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you{+} do not fast this day so as to make your{+} voice to be heard on high.

5. Is such the fast that I have chosen? The day for man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?

6. Isn't this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you{+} break every yoke?

7. Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you don't hide yourself from your own flesh?

8. Then will your light break forth as the morning, and your healing will spring forth speedily; and your righteousness will go before you; the glory of Yahweh will be your rearward.

9. Then you will call, and Yahweh will answer; you will cry, and he will say, Here I am. If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;

10. and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light will rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;

11. and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones strong; and you will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.

12. And those who will be of you will build the old waste places; you will raise up the foundations of many generations; and you will be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

13. If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, [and] the holy of Yahweh honorable; and will honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking [your own] words:

14. then you will delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.

## Isaiah 59

1. Look, Yahweh's hand is not shortened, that it can't save; neither his ear heavy, that it can't hear:

2. but your{+} iniquities have separated between you{+} and your{+} God, and your{+} sins have hid his face from you{+}, so that he will not hear.

3. For your{+} hands are defiled with blood, and your{+} fingers with iniquity; your{+} lips have spoken lies, your{+} tongue mutters wickedness.

4. None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they are pregnant with mischief, and give birth to iniquity.

5. They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.

6. Their webs will not become garments, neither will they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

7. Their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.

8. The way of peace they don't know; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them does not know peace.

9. Therefore justice is far from us, neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but see darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.

10. We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men.

11. We roar all like bears, and moan intensely like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.

12. For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:

13. transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, being pregnant with, and uttering from the heart, words of falsehood.

14. And justice has turned away backward, and righteousness stands far off; for truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness can't enter.

15. Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And Yahweh saw it, and it was evil in his eyes that there was no justice.

16. And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.

17. And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.

18. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.

19. So they will fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.

20. And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Yahweh.

21. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh: my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, says Yahweh, from now on and forever.

## Isaiah 60

1. Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of Yahweh has risen on you.

2. For, look, darkness will cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you, and his glory will be seen on you.

3. And nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.

4. Lift up your eyes round about, and see: all of them gather themselves together, they come to you; your sons will come from far, and your daughters will be carried in the arms.

5. Then you will see and be radiant, and your heart will thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you, the wealth of the nations will come to you.

6. The multitude of camels will cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba will come; they will bring gold and frankincense, and will proclaim the good news of the praises of Yahweh.

7. All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth will minister to you; they will come up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house of my glory.

8. Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?

9. Surely the isles will wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.

10. And foreigners will build up your walls, and their kings will minister to you: for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.

11. Your gates will also be open continually; they will not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.

12. For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish; yes, those nations will be completely wasted.

13. The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

14. And the sons of those who afflicted you will come bending to you; and all those who despised you will bow themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they will call you The city of Yahweh, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

15. Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.

16. You will also be nursed with the milk of the nations, and will be nursed with the breast of kings; and you will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

17. For bronze I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood bronze, and for stones iron. I will also make your officers peace, and your exactors righteousness.

18. Violence will no more be heard in your land, desolation nor destruction inside your borders; but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.

19. The sun will no more be your light by day; neither will the moon give light to you for brightness: but Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.

20. Your sun will no more go down, neither will your moon withdraw itself; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be ended.

21. Your people also will all be righteous; they will inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

22. The little one will become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will hurry it in its time.

## Isaiah 61

1. The Spirit of the Sovereign Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening [of the prison] to those who are bound;

2. to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;

3. to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh, that he may be glorified.

4. And they will build the old wastes, they will raise up the former desolations, and they will repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.

5. And strangers will stand and shepherd your{+} flocks, and foreigners will be your{+} plowmen and your{+} vine-dressers.

6. But you{+} will be named the priests of Yahweh; men will call you{+} the ministers of our God: you{+} will eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you{+} will boast yourselves.

7. Instead of your{+} shame [you{+} will have] double; and instead of dishonor they will rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they will possess double; everlasting joy will be to them.

8. For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with burnt-offerings; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

9. And their seed will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them will acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.

10. I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul will be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

11. For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Sovereign Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

## Isaiah 62

1. For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burns.

2. And the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you will be called by a new name, which the mouth of Yahweh will name.

3. You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.

4. You will no more be termed Forsaken; neither will your land anymore be termed Desolate: but you will be called Hephzi-bah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your land will be married.

5. For as a young man takes possession of a virgin, so will your sons take possession of you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so will your God rejoice over you.

6. I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never hold their peace day nor night: you{+} who are Yahweh's remembrancers, take{+} no rest,

7. and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

8. Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies; and foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored:

9. but those who have garnered it will eat it, and praise Yahweh; and those who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.

10. Go through, go through the gates; prepare{+} the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples.

11. Look, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say{+} to the daughter of Zion, Look, your salvation comes; look, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.

12. And they will call them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh: and you will be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.

## Isaiah 63

1. Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? This who is glorious in his apparel, striding in the greatness of his strength? I who speak in righteousness, with full resources to save.

2. Why are you red in your apparel, and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?

3. I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.

4. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.

5. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my wrath, it upheld me.

6. And I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.

7. I will make mention of the loving-kindnesses of Yahweh, [and] the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.

8. For he said, Surely, they are my people, sons who will not deal falsely: so he was their Savior.

9. In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.

10. But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself fought against them.

11. Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people, [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?

12. That caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? That divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?

13. That led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they didn't stumble?

14. As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest; so you led your people, to make yourself a glorious name.

15. Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where are your zeal and your mighty acts? The yearning of your insides and your compassions are restrained toward me.

16. For you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you, O Yahweh, are our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.

17. O Yahweh, why do you make us to err from your ways, and harden our heart from your fear? Return for your slaves' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.

18. Your holy people possessed [it] but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.

19. We have become as they over whom you never bore rule, as those who were not called by your name.

## Isaiah 64

1. Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,

2. as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!

3. When you did awesome things which we didn't look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.

4. For from of old men haven't heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him.

5. You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways: look, you were angry, and we sinned: in them [we have been] of long time; and shall we be saved?

6. For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and all of us fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.

7. And there is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you; for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.

8. But now, O Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and all of us are the work of your hand.

9. Don't be angry very intensely, O Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever: see, look, we urge you, we are all your people.

10. Your holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

11. Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.

12. Will you refrain yourself for these things, O Yahweh? Will you hold your peace, and afflict us very intensely?

## Isaiah 65

1. I am inquired of by those who didn't ask [for me]; I am found of those who didn't seek me: I said, Look at me, look at me, to a nation that did not call on my name.

2. I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;

3. a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;

4. that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of contaminated things is in their vessels;

5. that say, Stand by yourself, don't come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.

6. Look, it is written before me: I will not keep silent, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,

7. your{+} own iniquities, and the iniquities of your{+} fathers together, says Yahweh, that have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.

8. Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is in it: so I will do for my slaves' sake, that I may not destroy them all.

9. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen will inherit it, and my slaves will stay there.

10. And Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.

11. But you{+} who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny;

12. I will destine you{+} to the sword, and you{+} will all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you{+} did not answer; when I spoke, you{+} did not hear; but you{+} did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.

13. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, my slaves will eat, but you{+} will be hungry; look, my slaves will drink, but you{+} will be thirsty; look, my slaves will rejoice, but you{+} will be put to shame;

14. look, my slaves will sing for joy of heart, but you{+} will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for vexation of spirit.

15. And you{+} will leave your{+} name for a curse to my chosen; and the Sovereign Yahweh will slay you; and he will call his slaves by another name:

16. so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.

17. For, look, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be remembered, nor come into mind.

18. But be{+} glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, look, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

19. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there will be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.

20. There will be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child will die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old will be accursed.

21. And they will build houses, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

22. They will not build, and another inhabit; they will not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree will be the days of my people, and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.

23. They will not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their offspring with them.

24. And it will come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

25. The wolf and the lamb will be shepherded together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent's food. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says Yahweh.

## Isaiah 66

1. Thus says Yahweh, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will you{+} build to me? And what place will be my rest?

2. For all these things my hand has made, and [so] all these things had come to be, says Yahweh: but to this man I will look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.

3. He who kills an ox is as he who slays a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an oblation, [as he who offers] swine's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their detestable things:

4. I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none answered; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.

5. Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} who tremble at his word: Your{+} brothers who hate you{+}, who cast you{+} out for my name's sake, have said, Let Yahweh be glorious, that we may see your{+} joy; but it is those who will be put to shame.

6. A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Yahweh who renders recompense to his enemies.

7. Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.

8. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Will a land be born in one day? Will a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.

9. Will I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Yahweh: will I who cause to bring forth shut [the womb]? says your God.

10. Rejoice{+} with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you{+} who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you{+} who mourn over her;

11. that you{+} may be nursed and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you{+} may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

12. For thus says Yahweh, Look, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you{+} will be nursed and be borne on the side; and will be cuddled on the knees.

13. As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you{+}; and you{+} will be comforted in Jerusalem.

14. And you{+} will see [it], and your{+} heart will rejoice, and your{+} bones will flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Yahweh will be known toward his slaves; and he will have indignation against his enemies.

15. For, look, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

16. For by fire Yahweh will execute judgment, and by his sword, on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh will be many.

17. Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the detestable, and the mouse, they will come to an end together, says Yahweh.

18. As for me, given their works and their thoughts: [the time] comes that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they will come, and will see my glory.

19. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles far off, that haven't heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they will declare my glory among the nations.

20. And they will bring all your{+} brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the sons of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.

21. And of them I will also take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.

22. For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will remain before me, says Yahweh, so will your{+} seed and your{+} name remain.

23. And it will come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me, says Yahweh.

24. And they will go forth, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their worm will not die, neither will their fire be quenched; and they will be an abhorring to all flesh.
