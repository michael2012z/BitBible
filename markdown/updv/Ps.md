## Psalms 1

1. BOOK I. Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked; and in the way of sinners, does not stand, and in the seat of scoffers, does not sit.

2. But rather in the law of Yahweh, does he delight; and in his law does he meditate, day and night.

3. And he is like a tree planted by streams of water: its fruit it yields in season, and its leaf does not wither, and in all that he does, he prospers.

4. Not so are the wicked: but rather they are like chaff, which is blown away by the wind.

5. Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment; nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6. For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked, will perish.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?

2. The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Yahweh, and against his anointed, [saying],

3. Let us break apart their bonds, And cast away from us their cords.

4. He who sits in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.

5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, And in his intense displeasure, he will vex them:

6. Yet I have set my king On Zion my holy hill.

7. I will tell of the decree: Yahweh said to me, You are my son; This day I have begotten you.

8. Ask of me, and I will give [you] the nations for your inheritance; And for your possession, the uttermost parts of the earth.

9. You will shepherd them with a rod of iron; Like a potter's vessel, you will dash them in pieces.

10. Now therefore you{+} kings, be wise; Be instructed, you{+} judges of the earth.

11. Serve Yahweh with fear, And rejoice with trembling.

12. Embrace purity, or else he will be angry, and you{+} will perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

## Psalms 3

1. A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Yahweh, how are my adversaries increased! Many are those who rise up against me.

2. Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.

3. But you, O Yahweh, are a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.

4. I cry to Yahweh with my voice, And he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.

5. I laid myself down and slept; I awakened; For Yahweh sustains me.

6. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.

7. Arise, O Yahweh; save me, O my God: For you have struck all my enemies on the cheek bone; You have broken the teeth of the wicked.

8. Salvation belongs to Yahweh: Your blessing be on your people. Selah.

## Psalms 4

1. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; You have set me at large [when I was] in distress: Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.

2. O you{+} sons of a man, how long will my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you{+} love vanity? Will you{+} seek after falsehood? Selah.

3. But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.

4. Stand in awe, and don't sin: Commune with your{+} own heart on your{+} bed, and be still. Selah.

5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your{+} trust in Yahweh.

6. Many there are that say, Who will show us [any] good? Yahweh, lift up the light of your countenance on us.

7. You have put gladness in my heart, More than [they have] when their grain and their new wine are increased.

8. In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep; For you, Yahweh, alone make me dwell in safety.

## Psalms 5

1. For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Yahweh, consider my meditation.

2. Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for to you I will pray.

3. O Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice; In the morning I will order [my prayer] to you, and will keep watch.

4. For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness: Evil will not sojourn with you.

5. The arrogant will not stand in your sight: You hate all workers of iniquity.

6. You will destroy those who speak lies: Yahweh is disgusted by the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.

7. But as for me, in the abundance of your loving-kindness I will come into your house: In your fear I will worship toward your holy temple.

8. Lead me, O Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies; Make your way straight before my face.

9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is much wickedness; Their throat is an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue.

10. Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against you.

11. But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, Because you defend them: Let them also that love your name be joyful in you.

12. For you will bless the righteous; O Yahweh, you will circle him with favor as with a shield.

## Psalms 6

1. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your anger, Neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

2. Have mercy on me, O Yahweh; for I am withered away: Heal me, O Yahweh; for my bones are troubled.

3. My soul also is intensely troubled: And you, O Yahweh, how long?

4. Return, O Yahweh, deliver my soul: Save me for your loving-kindness' sake.

5. For in death there is no remembrance of you: In Sheol who will give you thanks?

6. I am weary with my groaning; Every night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

7. My eye wastes away because of grief; It waxes old because of all my adversaries.

8. Depart from me, all you{+} workers of iniquity; For Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.

9. Yahweh has heard my supplication; Yahweh will receive my prayer.

10. All my enemies will be put to shame and intensely troubled: They will turn back, they will be put to shame suddenly.

## Psalms 7

1. Shiggaion of David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Yahweh my God, in you I take refuge: Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,

2. Or else they will tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

3. O Yahweh my God, if I have done this; If there is iniquity in my hands;

4. If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me; (Yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary;)

5. Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, And cause my glory to stay in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O Yahweh, in your anger; Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries, And awake for me; you have commanded judgment.

7. And let the congregation of the peoples circle you about; And over them you return on high.

8. Yahweh will judge the peoples: Judge me, O Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.

9. O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but you establish the righteous: For the righteous God tries the minds and hearts.

10. My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.

11. God is a righteous judge, Yes, a God who has indignation every day.

12. If a man doesn't turn, he will whet his sword; He has bent his bow, and made it ready.

13. He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; He makes his arrows fiery [shafts].

14. Look, he travails with iniquity; Yes, he has become pregnant with mischief, and given birth to falsehood.

15. He has made a pit, and dug it, And has fallen into the ditch which he made.

16. His mischief will return on his own head, And his violence will come down on the top of his own head.

17. I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.

## Psalms 8

1. For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O Yahweh, our Lord, How excellent is your name in all the earth, Who has set your glory on the heavens!

2. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have established strength, Because of your adversaries, That you might still the enemy and the avenger.

3. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, The moon and the stars, which you have appointed;

4. What is common man, that you are mindful of him? And the son of man, that you visit him?

5. For you have made him but little lower than God, And crown him with glory and honor.

6. You make him to have dominion over the works of your hands; You have put all things under his feet:

7. All sheep and oxen, Yes, and the beasts of the field,

8. The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.

9. O Yahweh, our Lord, How excellent is your name in all the earth!

## Psalms 9

1. For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart; I will show forth all your marvelous works.

2. I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O you Most High.

3. When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at your presence.

4. For you have maintained my right and my cause; You sit in the throne judging righteously.

5. You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked; You have blotted out their name forever and ever.

6. The enemy have come to an end, they are desolate forever; And the cities which you have overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.

7. But Yahweh sits [as king] forever: He has prepared his throne for judgment;

8. And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will judge the peoples in uprightness.

9. Yahweh also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;

10. And those who know your name will put their trust in you; For you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.

11. Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.

12. For he who makes inquisition for blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the poor.

13. Have mercy on me, O Yahweh; Look at my affliction [which I suffer] of those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death;

14. That I may show forth all your praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in your salvation.

15. The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

16. Yahweh has made himself known, he has executed judgment: The wicked stumbles in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

17. The wicked will be turned back to Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.

18. For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish forever.

19. Arise, O Yahweh; Don't let common man prevail: Let the nations be judged in your sight.

20. Put them in fear, O Yahweh: Let the nations know themselves to be but common man. Selah.

## Psalms 10

1. Why do you stand far off, O Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

2. In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.

3. For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, And the covetous curses, [yes], scorns Yahweh.

4. The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, [says], He will not require [it]. All his thoughts are, There is no God.

5. His ways are firm at all times; Your judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffs at them.

6. He says in his heart, I will not be moved; To all generations I will not be in adversity.

7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

8. He sits in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places he murders the innocent; His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.

9. He lurks in secret as a lion in his covert; He lies in wait to catch the poor: He catches the poor, when he draws him in his net.

10. He crouches, he bows down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones.

11. He says in his heart, God has forgotten; He hides his face; he will never see it.

12. Arise, O Yahweh; O God, lift up your hand: Do not forget the poor.

13. Why does the wicked despise God, And say in his heart, You will not require [it]?

14. You have seen [it]; for you behold mischief and spite, to requite it with your hand: The helpless commits [himself] to you; You have been the helper of the fatherless.

15. Break the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.

16. Yahweh is King forever and ever: The nations have perished out of his land.

17. Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the meek: You will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to hear;

18. To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That common man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.

## Psalms 11

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. In Yahweh I take refuge: How do you{+} say to my soul, Flee to your{+} mountain, birds;

2. For, look, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow on the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;

3. If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?

4. Yahweh is in his holy temple; Yahweh, his throne is in heaven; His eyes look at, his eyelids try, the sons of man.

5. Yahweh tries the righteous; But the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.

6. On the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup.

7. For Yahweh is righteous; he loves righteousness: The upright will see his face.

## Psalms 12

1. For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases; For the faithful fail from among the sons of man.

2. They speak falsehood every man with his fellow man: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, they speak.

3. Yahweh will cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things;

4. Who have said, With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?

5. Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, Now I will arise, says Yahweh; I will set him in the safety he pants for.

6. The words of Yahweh are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times.

7. You will keep them, O Yahweh, You will preserve him from this generation forever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of man.

## Psalms 13

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

3. Consider [and] answer me, O Yahweh my God: Lighten my eyes, or else I will sleep the [sleep of] death;

4. Or else my enemy will say, I have prevailed against him; [and] my adversaries will rejoice when I am moved.

5. But I have trusted in your loving-kindness; My heart will rejoice in your salvation.

6. I will sing to Yahweh, Because he has dealt bountifully with me.

## Psalms 14

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done disgusting works; There is none who does good.

2. Yahweh looked down from heaven on the sons of man, To see if there were any who understood, That sought after God.

3. They have all gone aside; they have together become filthy; There is none who does good, no, not one.

4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And do not call on Yahweh?

5. There they were in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.

6. You{+} put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Yahweh is his refuge.

7. Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh brings back the captivity of his people, Then will Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel will be glad.

## Psalms 15

1. A Psalm of David. Yahweh, who will sojourn in your tabernacle? Who will stay in your holy hill?

2. He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart;

3. He who does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his friend, Nor takes up a reproach against his fellow man;

4. In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear Yahweh; He who swears to his own hurt, and does not change;

5. He who does not put out his money to interest, Nor takes reward against the innocent. He who does these things will never be moved.

## Psalms 16

1. Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God; for in you I take refuge.

2. I have said to Yahweh, You are my Lord: I have no good beyond you.

3. As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.

4. Their sorrows will be multiplied that hurry for another [god]: Their drink-offerings of blood I will not offer, Nor take their names on my lips.

5. Yahweh is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: You maintain my lot.

6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Yes, I have a goodly heritage.

7. I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel; Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.

8. I have set Yahweh always before me: Because he is at my right hand, I will not be moved.

9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will stay in safety.

10. For you will not leave my soul to Sheol; Neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.

11. You will show me the path of life: In your presence is fullness of joy; In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.

## Psalms 17

1. A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O Yahweh, attend to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, that does not go out of feigned lips.

2. Let my sentence come forth from your presence; Let your eyes look at equity.

3. You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; You have tried me, and find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.

4. As for the works of man, by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.

5. My steps have held fast to your paths, My feet have not slipped.

6. I have called on you, for you will answer me, O God: Incline your ear to me, [and] hear my speech.

7. Show your marvelous loving-kindness, O you who save by your right hand those who take refuge [in you] From those who rise up [against them].

8. Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of your wings,

9. From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, who circle me about.

10. They are enclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly.

11. They advance against me, now they surround me; They set their eyes to cast [me] down to the earth.

12. He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

13. Arise, O Yahweh, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;

14. From men by your hand, O Yahweh, From men of this world, whose portion is in [this] life, And whose belly you fill with your treasure: They are satisfied with sons, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

15. As for me, I will see your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with [seeing] your form.

## Psalms 18

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David the slave of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, and he said: I love you, O Yahweh, my strength.

2. Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.

3. I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So I will be saved from my enemies.

4. The cords of death surrounded me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.

5. The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.

6. In my distress I called on Yahweh, And cried to my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.

7. Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was angry.

8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.

9. He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.

10. And he rode on a cherub, and flew; Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.

11. He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of water, thick clouds of the skies.

12. At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.

13. Yahweh also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.

14. And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.

15. Then the channels of water appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At your rebuke, O Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

16. He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.

18. They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Yahweh was my support.

19. He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.

20. Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.

21. For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all his ordinances were before me, And I do not put away his statutes from me.

23. I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from my iniquity.

24. Therefore Yahweh has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyes.

25. With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; With the perfect [noble] man you will show yourself perfect;

26. With the pure you will show yourself pure; And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.

27. For you will save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes you will bring down.

28. For you will light my lamp: Yahweh my God will lighten my darkness.

29. For by you I run on a troop; And by my God I leap over a wall.

30. As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Yahweh is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.

31. For who is God, but Yahweh? And who is a rock, besides our God,

32. The God who girds me with strength, And makes my way perfect?

33. He makes my feet like hinds' [feet]: And sets me on my high places.

34. He teaches my hands to war; So that my arms bend a bow of bronze.

35. You have also given me the shield of your salvation; And your right hand has held me up, And your response made me great.

36. You have enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.

37. I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.

38. I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise: They will fall under my feet.

39. For you have girded me with strength to the battle: You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.

40. You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, That I might cut off those who hate me.

41. They cried, but there was none to save; Even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them.

42. Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I cast them out as the mire of the streets.

43. You have delivered me from the strivings of a people; You have made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known will serve me.

44. As soon as they hear of me they will obey me; The foreigners will submit themselves to me.

45. The foreigners will fade away, And will come trembling out of their close places.

46. Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,

47. Even the God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me.

48. He rescues me from my enemies; Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me; You deliver me from the violent man.

49. Therefore I will give thanks to you, O Yahweh, among the nations, And will sing praises to your name.

50. Great deliverance he gives to his king, And shows loving-kindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, forevermore.

## Psalms 19

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows his handiwork.

2. Day to day gushes out speech, And night to night shows knowledge.

3. There is no speech nor language; Where their voice is not heard.

4. Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tabernacle for the sun,

5. Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoices as a strong man to run his course.

6. His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit to the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from its heat.

7. The law of Yahweh is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Yahweh is sure, making wise the simple.

8. The precepts of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.

9. The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever: The ordinances of Yahweh are true, [and] righteous altogether.

10. More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.

11. Moreover by them is your slave warned: In keeping them there is great reward.

12. Who can discern [his] errors? Acquit me from hidden [faults].

13. Keep back your slave also from presumptuous [sins]; Don't let them have dominion over me: Then I will be upright, And I will be innocent from great transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in your sight, O Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.

## Psalms 20

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set you up on high;

2. Send you help from the sanctuary, And strengthen you out of Zion;

3. Remember all your offerings, And accept your burnt-sacrifice; Selah.

4. Grant you your heart's desire, And fulfill all your counsel.

5. We will triumph in your salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Yahweh fulfill all your petitions.

6. Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand.

7. Some [trust] in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Yahweh our God.

8. They are bowed down and fallen; But we have risen, and stand upright.

9. Save, Yahweh: Let the King answer us when we call.

## Psalms 21

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The king will joy in your strength, O Yahweh; And in your salvation how greatly he will rejoice!

2. You have given him his heart's desire, And have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

3. For you meet him with the blessings of goodness: You set a crown of fine gold on his head.

4. He asked life of you, you gave it him, Even length of days forever and ever.

5. His glory is great in your salvation: Honor and majesty you lay on him.

6. For you make him most blessed forever: You make him glad with joy in your presence.

7. For the king trusts in Yahweh; And through the loving-kindness of the Most High he will not be moved.

8. Your hand will find out all your enemies; Your right hand will find out those who hate you.

9. You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger: Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire will devour them.

10. Their fruit you will destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the sons of man.

11. For they intended evil against you; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.

12. For you will make them turn their back; You will make ready with your bowstrings against their face.

13. Be exalted, O Yahweh, in your strength: So we will sing and praise your power.

## Psalms 22

1. For the Chief Musician; set to Aijeleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? [Why are you so] far from helping me, [and from] the words of my groaning?

2. O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you don't answer; And in the night season, and am not silent.

3. But you are holy, O you who inhabit the praises of Israel.

4. Our fathers trusted in you: They trusted, and you delivered them.

5. They cried to you, and were delivered: They trusted in you, and were not put to shame.

6. But I am a worm, and not a man; A reproach of man, and despised of the people.

7. All those who see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying],

8. Commit [yourself] to Yahweh; Let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delights in him.

9. But you are he who took me out of the womb; You made me trust [when I was] on my mother's breasts.

10. I was cast on you from the womb; You are my God since my mother bore me.

11. Don't be far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help.

12. Many bulls have surrounded me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.

13. They gape on me with their mouth, [As] a ravening and a roaring lion.

14. I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted inside me.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue is sticking to my jaws; And you have brought me into the dust of death.

16. For dogs have surrounded me: A company of evildoers have enclosed me; They surrounded me like a lion [threatening] to tear me to pieces.

17. I may count all my bones; They look and stare on me.

18. They part my garments among them, And on my vesture they cast lots.

19. But don't be far off, O Yahweh: O you my succor, hurry to help me.

20. Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog.

21. Save me from the lion's mouth; Yes, from the horns of the wild-oxen you have answered me.

22. I will declare your name to my brothers: In the midst of the assembly I will praise you.

23. You{+} who fear Yahweh, praise him; All you{+} the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all you{+} the seed of Israel.

24. For he has not despised nor detested the affliction of the afflicted; Neither has he hid his face from him; But when he cried to him, he heard.

25. Of you comes my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before those who fear him.

26. The meek will eat and be satisfied; They will praise Yahweh who seek after him: Let your{+} heart live forever.

27. All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to Yahweh; And all the kindreds of the nations will worship before you.

28. For the kingdom is Yahweh's; And he is the ruler over the nations.

29. All the fat ones of the earth will eat and worship: All those who go down to the dust will bow before him, Even he who can't keep his soul alive.

30. A seed will serve him; It will be told of the Lord to the [next] generation.

31. They will come and will declare his righteousness To a people who will be born, that he has done it.

6. This is the generation of those who seek after him, That seek your face, Jacob. Selah.

8. Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, And the place where your glory dwells.

9. Don't gather my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood;

10. In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes.

5. For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me; He will lift me up on a rock.

6. And now will my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.

11. Teach me your way, O Yahweh; And lead me in a plain path, Because of my enemies.

12. Don't deliver me over to the will of my adversaries: For false witnesses have risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.

5. For his anger is but for a moment; His favor is for a lifetime: Weeping may spend the night, But joy [comes] in the morning.

6. As for me, I said in my prosperity, I will not be moved--forever.

7. You, Yahweh, of your favor had made my mountain to stand strong: You hid your face; I was troubled.

8. To you, O Yahweh, I will cry; And to the Lord I will plead for mercy:

9. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it declare your truth?

10. Hear, O Yahweh, and have mercy on me: Yahweh, be my helper.

11. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

12. So that glory will sing praise to you, and not be silent. O Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you--forever.

## Psalms 31

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. In you, O Yahweh, I take refuge; Let me never be put to shame: Deliver me in your righteousness.

3. For you are my rock and my fortress; Therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me.

4. Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me; For you are my stronghold.

5. Into your hand I commend my spirit: You have redeemed me, O Yahweh, you God of truth.

6. I hate those who regard lying vanities; But I trust in Yahweh.

7. I will be glad and rejoice in your loving-kindness; For you have seen my affliction: You have known my soul in adversities;

8. And you have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a large place.

9. Have mercy on me, O Yahweh, for I am in distress: My eye wastes away with grief, [yes], my soul and my body.

10. For my life is spent with sorrow, And my years with sighing: My strength fails because of my iniquity, And my bones are wasted away.

11. Because of all my adversaries I have become a reproach, Yes, to my neighbors exceedingly, And a fear to my acquaintance: Those who saw me outside fled from me.

12. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.

13. For I have heard the defaming of many, Terror on every side: While they took counsel together against me, They devised to take away my life.

14. But I trusted in you, O Yahweh: I said, You are my God.

15. My times are in your hand: Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.

16. Make your face to shine on your slave: Save me in your loving-kindness.

17. Don't let me be put to shame, O Yahweh; for I have called on you: Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.

18. Let the lying lips be mute, Which speak against the righteous insolently, With pride and contempt.

19. Oh how great is your goodness, Which you have laid up for those who fear you, Which you have wrought for those who take refuge in you, Before the sons of man!

20. In the covert of your presence you will hide them from the plottings of man: You will keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

21. Blessed be Yahweh; For he has shown me his marvelous loving-kindness in a strong city.

22. As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before your eyes: Nevertheless you heard the voice of my supplications When I cried to you.

23. Oh love Yahweh, all you{+} his saints: Yahweh preserves the faithful, And plentifully rewards him who deals proudly.

24. Be strong, and let your{+} heart take courage, All you{+} who hope in Yahweh.

## Psalms 32

6. For this let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they will not reach to him.

7. You are my hiding-place; you will preserve me from trouble; You will circle me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

8. I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you will go: I will counsel you with my eye on you.

13. Yahweh looks from heaven; He beholds all the sons of man;

14. From the place of his habitation he looks forth On all the inhabitants of the earth,

15. He who fashions the hearts of them all, That considers all their works.

16. There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.

17. A horse is a vain thing for safety; Neither does he deliver any by his great power.

18. Look, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, On those who hope in his loving-kindness;

19. To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.

20. Our soul has waited for Yahweh: He is our help and our shield.

10. The young lions lack, and suffer hunger; But those who seek Yahweh will not want any good thing.

11. Come, you{+} sons, listen to me: I will teach you{+} the fear of Yahweh.

12. What man is he who desires life, And loves [many] days, that he may see good?

2. Take hold of shield and buckler, And stand up for my help.

3. Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against those who pursue me: Say to my soul, I am your salvation.

4. Let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor that seek after my soul: Let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt.

5. Let them be as chaff before the wind, And the angel of Yahweh driving [them] on.

6. Let their way be dark and slippery, And the angel of Yahweh pursuing them.

7. For without cause they have hid for me the pit of their net; Without cause they have dug [it] for my soul.

8. Let destruction come upon him unawares; And let his net that he has hid catch himself: With destruction let him fall in it.

9. And my soul will be joyful in Yahweh: It will rejoice in his salvation.

10. All my bones will say, Yahweh, who is like you, Who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him, Yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?

11. Unrighteous witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I don't know.

12. They reward me evil for good, [To] the bereaving of my soul.

13. But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting; And my prayer returned into my own bosom.

14. I behaved myself as though it had been my companion or my brother: I bowed down mourning, as one who bewails his mother.

15. But in my adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I didn't know [it]; They tore me, and did not cease:

16. Among the wicked, the godless fools Who gnashed on me with their teeth.

17. Lord, how long will you watch? Rescue my soul from their destructions, My darling from the lions.

18. I will give you thanks in the great assembly: I will praise you among many people.

19. Don't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

20. For they don't speak peace; But they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.

21. Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye has seen it.

22. You have seen it, O Yahweh; don't keep silent: O Lord, don't be far from me.

23. Stir up yourself, and awake to the justice [due] to me, [Even] to my cause, my God and my Lord.

24. Judge me, O Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness; And don't let them rejoice over me.

25. Don't let them say in their heart, Aha, so we would have it: Don't let them say, We have swallowed him up.

26. Let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt: Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.

27. Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause: Yes, let them say continually, Yahweh be magnified, Who has pleasure in the prosperity of his slave.

28. And my tongue will talk of your righteousness [And] of your praise all the day long.

## Psalms 36

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David the slave of Yahweh. The transgression of the wicked says inside his heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.

2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes, That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.

3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: He has ceased to be wise [and] to do good.

4. He devises iniquity on his bed; He sets himself in a way that is not good; He does not abhor evil.

5. Your loving-kindness, O Yahweh, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness [reaches] to the skies.

6. Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your judgments are a great deep: O Yahweh, you preserve man and beast.

7. How precious is your loving-kindness, O God! And the sons of man take refuge under the shadow of your wings.

8. They will be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; And you will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.

9. For with you is the fountain of life: In your light we will see light.

10. Oh continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, And your righteousness to the upright in heart.

11. Don't let the foot of pride come against me, And don't let the hand of the wicked drive me away.

12. There the workers of iniquity have fallen: They are thrust down, and will not be able to rise.

## Psalms 37

1. [A Psalm] of David. Don't fret yourself because of evildoers, Neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.

4. Delight yourself also in Yahweh; And he will give you the desires of your heart.

5. Commit your way to Yahweh; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.

6. And he will make your righteousness to go forth as the light, And your justice as the noonday.

7. Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him: Don't fret yourself because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.

8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Don't fret yourself, [it tends] only to evildoing.

9. For evildoers will be cut off; But those who wait for Yahweh, they will inherit the land.

10. For yet a little while, and the wicked will not be: Yes, you will diligently consider his place, and he will not be.

11. But the meek will inherit the land, And will delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

12. The wicked plots against the just, And gnashes on him with his teeth.

13. The Lord will laugh at him; For he sees that his day is coming.

14. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.

15. Their sword will enter into their own heart, And their bows will be broken.

16. Better is a little that the righteous has Than the abundance of many wicked.

17. For the arms of the wicked will be broken; But Yahweh upholds the righteous.

18. Yahweh knows the days of the perfect; And their inheritance will be forever.

19. They will not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they will be satisfied.

20. But the wicked will perish, And the enemies of Yahweh will be as the fat of lambs: They will consume; in smoke they will consume away.

21. The wicked borrows, and does not pay again; But the righteous deals graciously, and gives.

22. For such as are blessed of him will inherit the land; And those who are cursed of him will be cut off.

23. A [noble] man's goings are established of Yahweh; And he delights in his way.

24. Though he falls, he will not be completely cast down; For Yahweh upholds him with his hand.

25. I have been young, and now am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.

26. All the day long he deals graciously, and lends; And his seed is blessed.

27. Depart from evil, and do good; And stay forevermore.

28. For Yahweh loves justice, And does not forsake his saints; They are preserved forever: But the seed of the wicked will be cut off.

29. The righteous will inherit the land, And stay in it forever.

30. The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom, And his tongue speaks justice.

31. The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps will slide.

32. The wicked watches the righteous, And seeks to slay him.

33. Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.

34. Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, And he will exalt you to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.

35. I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.

36. But one passed by, and, look, he was not: Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.

37. Mark the perfect man, and look at the upright; For there is a [happy] end to the man of peace.

38. As for transgressors, they will be destroyed together; The end of the wicked will be cut off.

39. But the salvation of the righteous is of Yahweh; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.

40. And Yahweh helps them, and rescues them; He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.

## Psalms 38

1. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath; Neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

2. For your arrows pierce into me, And your hand presses me intensely.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.

4. For my iniquities have gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

5. My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness.

6. I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

7. For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am faint and very bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

9. Lord, all my desire is before you; And my groaning is not hid from you.

10. My heart throbs, my strength fails me: As for the light of my eyes, it also has gone from me.

11. My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand far off.

12. Those also that seek after my life lay snares [for me]; And those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long.

13. But I, as a deaf man, don't hear; And I am as a mute man who does not open his mouth.

14. Yes, I am as a man who does not hear, And in whose mouth are no reproofs.

15. For in you, O Yahweh, I hope: You will answer, O Lord my God.

16. For I said, Or else they will rejoice over me: When my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.

17. For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me.

18. For I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19. But my enemies are lively, [and] are strong; And those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

20. They also that render evil for good Are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good.

21. Don't forsake me, O Yahweh: O my God, don't be far from me.

22. Hurry to help me, O Lord, my salvation.

## Psalms 39

1. For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I don't sin with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.

2. I was mute with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.

3. My heart was hot inside me; While I was musing the fire burned: [Then] I spoke with my tongue:

4. Yahweh, make me to know my end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.

5. Look, you have made my days [as] handbreadths; And my lifetime is as nothing before you: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah.

6. Surely everyone among man walks in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heaps up [riches], and does not know who will gather them.

7. And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions: Don't make me the reproach of the foolish.

9. I was mute, I did not open my mouth; Because you did it.

10. Remove your stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of your hand.

11. When you with rebukes correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely everyone among man is vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, and give ear to my cry; Don't hold your peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with you, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.

13. Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go from here, and be no more.

## Psalms 40

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for Yahweh; And he inclined to me, and heard my cry.

2. He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet on a rock, and established my goings.

3. And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God: Many will see it, and fear, And will trust in Yahweh.

4. Blessed is the [noble] man who makes Yahweh his trust, And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

5. Many, O Yahweh my God, are the wonderful works which you have done, And your thoughts which are toward us; They can't be set in order to you; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.

6. Sacrifice and offering you have no delight in; My ears you have opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required.

7. Then I said, Look, I have come; In the roll of the book it is written of me:

8. I delight to do your will, O my God; Yes, your law is inside me.

9. I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness in the great assembly; Look, I will not refrain my lips, O Yahweh, you know.

10. I have not hid your righteousness inside my heart; I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your loving-kindness and your truth from the great assembly.

11. Don't withhold your tender mercies from me, O Yahweh; Let your loving-kindness and your truth continually preserve me.

12. For innumerable evils have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart has failed me.

13. Be pleased, O Yahweh, to deliver me: Hurry to help me, O Yahweh.

14. Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.

15. Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say to me, Aha, aha.

16. Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you: Let such as love your salvation say continually, Yahweh be magnified.

17. But I am poor and needy; [Yet] the Lord thinks on me: You are my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God.

## Psalms 41

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he who considers the poor: Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.

2. Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive, And he will be called blessed on the earth; And you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.

3. Yahweh will support him on the couch of languishing: You make all his bed in his sickness.

4. I said, O Yahweh, have mercy on me: Heal my soul; for I have sinned against you.

5. My enemies speak evil against me, [saying], When will he die, and his name perish?

6. And if he comes to see [me], he speaks falsehood; His heart gathers iniquity to itself: When he goes abroad, he tells it.

7. All who hate me whisper together against me; Against me they devise my hurt.

8. An evil disease, [they say], is poured out on him; And now that he lies he will rise up no more.

9. Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who ate of my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.

10. But you, O Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, That I may requite them.

11. By this I know that you delight in me, Because my enemy does not triumph over me.

12. And as for me, you uphold me in my integrity, And set me before your face forever.

13. Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

## Psalms 42

1. BOOK II. For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the sons of Korah. As a doe pants after the water brooks, So my soul pants after you, O God.

2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: When shall I come and see the face of God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say to me, Where is your God?

4. These things I remember, and pour out my soul inside me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And [why] are you disquieted inside me? Hope in God; for I will yet praise him, My salvation

6. and my God. My soul is cast down inside me: Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

7. Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls: All your waves and your billows have gone over me.

8. [Yet] Yahweh will command his loving-kindness in the daytime; And in the night his song will be with me, [Even] a prayer to the God of my life.

9. I will say to God my rock, Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

10. With a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, While they continually say to me, Where is your God?

11. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted inside me? Hope in God; for I will yet praise him, My salvation and my God.

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2. For you are the God of my strength; why have you cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3. Oh send out your light and your truth; let them lead me: Let them bring me to your holy hill, And to your tabernacles.

4. Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And on the harp I will praise you, O God, my God.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted inside me? Hope in God; for I will yet praise him, My salvation and my God.

## Psalms 44

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work you did in their days, In the days of old.

2. You drove out the nations with your hand; But you planted them: You afflicted the peoples; But you spread them abroad.

3. For they did not get the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, Because you were favorable to them.

4. You are my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.

5. Through you we will push down our adversaries: Through your name we will tread them under that rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, Neither will my sword save me.

7. But you have saved us from our adversaries, And have put them to shame that hate us.

8. In God we have made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.

9. But now you have cast [us] off, and brought us to dishonor, And don't go forth with our hosts.

10. You make us to turn back from the adversary; And those who hate us take spoil for themselves.

11. You have made us like sheep [appointed] for food, And have scattered us among the nations.

12. You sell your people for nothing, And have not increased [your wealth] by their price.

13. You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to those who are round about us.

14. You make us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.

15. All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face has covered me,

16. For the voice of him who reproaches and blasphemes, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.

17. All this has come upon us; Yet we have not forgotten you, Neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.

18. Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from your way,

19. That you have intensely broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;

21. Will not God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.

22. Yes, for your sake we are killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

23. Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord? Arise, don't cast [us] off forever.

24. Why do you hide your face, And forget our affliction and our oppression?

25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body sticks to the earth.

26. Rise up for our help, And redeem us for your loving-kindness' sake.

## Psalms 45

1. For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves. My heart overflows with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made concerning the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

2. You are fairer than the sons of man; Grace is poured into your lips: Therefore God has blessed you forever.

3. Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, Your glory and your majesty.

4. And in your majesty ride on prosperously, Because of truth and meekness [and] righteousness: And your right hand will teach you awesome things.

5. Your arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under you; [They are] in the heart of the king's enemies.

6. Your throne, O God, is forever and ever: A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.

7. You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: Therefore God, your God, has anointed you With the oil of gladness above your peers.

8. All your garments [smell of] myrrh, and aloes, [and] cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.

9. Kings' daughters are among your honorable women: At your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

10. Listen, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; Forget also your own people, and your father's house:

11. So will the king desire your beauty; For he is your lord; and you will reverence him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre [will be there] with a gift; The rich among the people will entreat your favor.

13. The king's daughter inside [the palace] is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold.

14. She will be led to the king in embroidered work: The virgins her companions that follow her will be brought to you.

15. With gladness and rejoicing they will be led: They will enter into the king's palace.

16. Instead of your fathers will be your sons, Whom you will make princes in all the earth.

17. I will make your name to be remembered in all generations: Therefore will the peoples give you thanks forever and ever.

## Psalms 46

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.

2. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth changes, And though the mountains shake into the heart of the seas;

3. Though its waters roar and are troubled, Though the mountains tremble with its swelling. Selah.

4. There is a river, the streams of which make glad the city of God, The holy of the tabernacles of the Most High.

5. God is in the midst of her; she will not be moved: God will help her, and that right early.

6. The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted.

7. Yahweh of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

8. Come, look at the works of Yahweh, What desolations he has made in the earth.

9. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in sunder; He burns the shields in the fire.

10. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.

11. Yahweh of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

## Psalms 47

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Oh clap your{+} hands, all you{+} peoples; Shout to God with the voice of triumph.

2. For Yahweh Most High is awesome; He is a great King over all the earth.

3. He subdues peoples under us, And nations under our feet.

4. He chooses our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

5. God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.

6. Sing Praise to God, sing praises: Sing praises to our King, sing praises.

7. For God is the King of all the earth: Sing{+} praises with understanding.

8. God reigns over the nations: God sits on his holy throne.

9. The princes of the peoples are gathered together [To be] the people of the God of Abraham: For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.

## Psalms 48

1. A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.

2. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is mount Zion, [on] the sides of the north, The city of the great King.

3. God has made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.

4. For, look, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.

5. They saw it, then they were amazed; They were dismayed, they hurried away.

6. Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail.

7. With the east wind You break the ships of Tarshish.

8. As we have heard, so we have seen In the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it forever. Selah.

9. We have thought on your loving-kindness, O God, In the midst of your temple.

10. As is your name, O God, So is your praise to the ends of the earth: Your right hand is full of righteousness.

11. Let mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of your judgments.

12. Walk about Zion, and go round about her; Number its towers;

13. Mark{+} well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces: That you{+} may tell it to the generation following.

14. For this God is our God forever and ever: He will be our guide [even] to death.

## Psalms 49

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all you{+} peoples; Give ear, all you{+} inhabitants of this world,

2. Both sons of man and sons of a man Together, rich and poor.

3. My mouth will speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart will be of understanding.

4. I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying on the harp.

5. Why should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels circles me about?

6. Those who trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

7. None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him;

8. (For the redemption of their life is costly, And it fails forever;)

9. That he should still live always, That he should not see corruption.

10. For he will see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.

11. Their graves are their houses forever, [And] their dwelling-places to all generations; [Even though] they call lands after their own names.

12. But man [being] in honor does not reside: He is like the beasts that perish.

13. This way of theirs is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah.

14. They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death will be their shepherd; And the upright will have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty will be for Sheol to consume, Far away from their lofty home.

15. But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah.

16. Don't be afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.

17. For when he dies he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him.

18. Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise you, when you do well to yourself,)

19. He will go to the generation of his fathers; They will never see the light.

20. Man who is in honor, and does not understand, Is like the beasts that perish.

## Psalms 50

1. A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, has spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun to the going down of it.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined forth.

3. Our God comes, and does not keep silent: A fire devours before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him.

4. He calls to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people:

5. Gather my saints together to me, Those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

6. And the heavens will declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. Selah.

7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify to you: I am God, [even] your God.

8. I will not reprove you for your sacrifices; And your burnt-offerings are continually before me.

9. I will take no bull out of your house, Nor he-goats out of your folds.

10. For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle on a thousand hills.

11. I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you; For the world is mine, and the fullness of it.

13. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?

14. Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay your vows to the Most High:

15. And call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will glorify me.

16. But to the wicked God says, What have you to do to declare my statutes, And that you have taken my covenant in your mouth,

17. Seeing you hate instruction, And cast my words behind you?

18. When you saw a thief, you consented with him, And have been a partaker with adulterers.

19. You give your mouth to evil, And your tongue frames deceit.

20. You sit and speak against your brother; You slander your own mother's son.

21. These things you have done, and I kept silent; You thought that I was altogether such a one as yourself: [But] I will reprove you, and set [them] in order before your eyes.

22. Now consider this, you{+} who forget God, Or else I will tear you{+} in pieces, and there will be none to deliver:

23. Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me; And to him who orders his way [aright] I will show the salvation of God.

## Psalms 51

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness: According to the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.

3. For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me.

4. Against you, you only, I have sinned, And done that which is evil in your sight; That you may be justified when you speak, And be clear when you judge.

5. Look, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin did my mother conceive me.

6. Look, you desire truth in the inward parts; And in the hidden part you will make me to know wisdom.

7. Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean: Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

8. Make me to hear joy and gladness, That the bones which you have broken may rejoice.

9. Hide your face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities.

10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit inside me.

11. Don't cast me away from your presence; And don't take your holy Spirit from me.

12. Restore to me the joy of your salvation; And uphold me with a willing spirit.

13. Then I will teach transgressors your ways; And sinners will be converted to you.

14. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, God of my salvation; [And] my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.

15. O Lord, open you my lips; And my mouth will show forth your praise.

16. For you do not delight in sacrifice; or else I would give it: You have no pleasure in burnt-offering.

17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

18. Do good in your good pleasure to Zion: Build the walls of Jerusalem.

19. Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, In burnt-offering and in whole burnt-offering: Then they will offer bullocks on your altar.

## Psalms 52

1. For the Chief Musician. Maschil of David; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast yourself in mischief, O mighty man? The loving-kindness of God [endures] continually.

2. Your tongue devises much wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

3. You love evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

4. You love all devouring words, O you deceitful tongue.

5. God will likewise destroy you forever; He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, And root you out of the land of the living. Selah.

6. The righteous also will see [it], and fear, And will laugh at him, [saying],

7. Look, this is the [prominent] man who did not make God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his plunder.

8. But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the loving-kindness of God forever and ever.

9. I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it; And I will proclaim your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.

## Psalms 53

1. For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and have done disgusting iniquity; There is none who does good.

2. God looked down from heaven on the sons of man, To see if there were any who understood, That sought after God.

3. Every one of them has gone back; they have together become filthy; There is none who does good, no, not one.

4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And do not call on God?

5. There they were in great fear, where no fear was; For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you: You have put [them] to shame, because God has rejected them.

6. Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, Then Jacob will rejoice, [and] Israel will be glad.

## Psalms 54

1. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by your name, And judge me in your might.

2. Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.

3. For strangers have risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them. Selah.

4. Look, God is my helper: The Lord is of those who uphold my soul.

5. He will bring back the evil to my enemies: Destroy them in your truth.

6. With a freewill-offering I will sacrifice to you: I will give thanks to your name, O Yahweh, for it is good.

7. For he has delivered me out of all trouble; And my eye has seen [my desire] on my enemies.

## Psalms 55

1. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; And don't hide yourself from my supplication.

2. Attend to me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan,

3. Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast iniquity on me, And in anger they persecute me.

4. My heart is very pained inside me: And the terrors of death have fallen on me.

5. Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, And horror has overwhelmed me.

6. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and stay at rest.

7. Look, then I would wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.

8. I would hurry myself to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest.

9. Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.

10. Day and night they go about it on its walls: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.

11. Wickedness is in the midst of it: Oppression and guile do not depart from its streets.

12. For it is not an enemy that reproached me; Or I could have borne it: It is not one who hated me that magnified himself against me; Or I would have hid myself from him:

13. But it was you, [a] common man like me, My best friend who I knew well.

14. We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.

15. Let death come suddenly on them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.

16. As for me, I will call on God; And Yahweh will save me.

17. Evening, and morning, and at noonday, I will complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.

18. He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many [that strove] with me.

19. God will hear, and answer them, Even he who remains of old. Selah. [The men] who have no changes, And who don't fear God.

20. He has put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He has profaned his covenant.

21. His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords.

22. Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you: He will never allow the righteous to be moved.

23. But you, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days; But I will trust in you.

## Psalms 56

1. For the Chief Musician; set to The Silent Dove - Those Far Away. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam: when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God; for common man would swallow me up: All the day long those fighting oppress me.

2. My enemies would swallow me up all the day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me.

3. When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.

4. In God (I will praise his word) In God I have put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do to me?

5. All the day long they wrest my words: All their thoughts are against me for evil.

6. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my soul.

7. Will they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.

8. You number my wanderings: Put my tears into your bottle; Are they not in your book?

9. Then my enemies will turn back in the day that I call: This I know, that God is for me.

10. In God, I will praise [his] word; In Yahweh, I will praise [his] word;

11. In God I have put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can man do to me?

12. Your vows are on me, O God: I will render thank-offerings to you.

13. For you have delivered my soul from death: [Have you] not [delivered] my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?

## Psalms 57

1. For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me; For my soul takes refuge in you: Yes, in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, Until [these] calamities have passed by.

2. I will cry to God Most High, To God who performs [all things] for me.

3. He will send from heaven, and save me, [When] he who would swallow me up reproaches; Selah. God will send forth his loving-kindness and his truth.

4. My soul is among lions; I lie among those who are set on fire, Even the sons of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.

5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] your glory [be] above all the earth.

6. They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have dug a pit before me; They have fallen into the midst of it themselves. Selah.

7. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.

8. Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake the dawn.

9. I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises to you among the nations.

10. For your loving-kindness is great to the heavens, And your truth to the skies.

11. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] your glory [be] above all the earth.

## Psalms 58

1. For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam. Do you{+} indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do you{+} judge uprightly, O you{+} sons of man?

2. No, in heart you{+} work wickedness; You{+} weigh out the violence of your{+} hands in the earth.

3. The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: [They are] like the deaf cobra that stops her ear,

5. Which does not harken to the voice of charmers Using magic words with mastery.

6. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Yahweh.

7. Let them melt away as water that runs apace: When he aims his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.

8. [Let them be] as a snail which melts and passes away, [Like] the untimely birth of a woman, that has not seen the sun.

9. Before your{+} pots can feel the thorns, He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.

10. The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance: He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;

11. So that man will say, Truly there is a reward for the righteous: Truly there is a God who judges in the earth.

## Psalms 59

1. For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: Set me on high from those who rise up against me.

2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men.

3. For, look, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Yahweh.

4. They run and prepare themselves without [my] fault: Awake to help me, and behold.

5. Even you, O Yahweh God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Don't be merciful to any wicked betrayers. Selah.

6. They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city.

7. Look, they gush out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: [They say,] For who hears?

8. But you, O Yahweh, will laugh at them; You will have all the nations in derision.

9. My strength, I will give heed to you; For God is my high tower.

10. My God with his loving-kindness will meet me: God will let me see [my desire] on my enemies.

11. Don't slay them, or else my people will forget: Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

12. [For] the sin of their mouth, [and] the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak.

13. Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they will be no more: And let them know that God rules in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.

14. And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city.

15. They will wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they are not satisfied.

16. But I will sing of your strength; Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving-kindness in the morning: For you have been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.

17. To you, O my strength, I will sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.

## Psalms 60

1. For the Chief Musician; set to Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and struck of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. O God you have cast us off, you have broken us down; You have been angry; oh restore us again.

2. You have made the land to tremble; you have rent it: Heal its breaches; for it shakes.

3. You have shown your people hard things: You have made us to drink the wine of staggering.

4. You have given a banner to those who fear you, That it may be displayed because of the bow. Selah.

5. That your beloved may be delivered, Save with your right hand, and answer us.

6. God has spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defense of my head; Judah is my scepter.

8. Moab is my washpot; On Edom I will cast my sandal: Philistia, shout because of me.

9. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom?

10. Have not you, O God, cast us off? And you don't go forth, O God, with our hosts.

11. Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.

12. Through God we will do valiantly; For it is he who will tread down our adversaries.

## Psalms 61

1. For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. [A Psalm] of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend to my prayer.

2. From the end of the earth I will call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed: You will lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

3. For you have been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy.

4. I will dwell in your tabernacle forever: I will take refuge in the covert of your wings. Selah.

5. For you, O God, have heard my vows: You have given [me] the heritage of those who fear your name.

6. You will prolong the king's life; His years will be as many generations.

7. He will remain before God forever: Oh prepare loving-kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.

8. So I will sing praise to your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows.

## Psalms 62

1. For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. My soul waits in silence for God only: From him [comes] my salvation.

2. He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I will not be greatly moved.

3. How long will you{+} set on a man, That you{+} may slay [him], all of you{+} Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?

4. They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

5. My soul, wait in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him.

6. He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I will not be moved.

7. With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

8. Trust in him at all times, you{+} people; Pour out your{+} heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

9. Surely sons of man are vanity, and sons of a man are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.

10. Don't trust in oppression, And don't become vain in robbery: If riches increase, don't set your{+} heart [on them].

11. God has spoken once, Twice I have heard this, That power belongs to God.

12. Also to you, O Lord, belongs loving-kindness; For you render to every man according to his work.

## Psalms 63

1. A Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, you are my God; earnestly I will seek you: My soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you, In a dry and weary land, where there is no water.

2. So I have looked on you in the sanctuary, To see your power and your glory.

3. Because your loving-kindness is better than life, My lips will praise you.

4. So I will bless you while I live: I will lift up my hands in your name.

5. My soul will be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth will praise you with joyful lips;

6. When I remember you on my bed, [And] meditate on you in the night-watches.

7. For you have been my help, And in the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.

8. My soul sticks [closely] after you: Your right hand upholds me.

9. But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, Will go into the lower parts of the earth.

10. They will be given over to the power of the sword: They will be a portion for foxes.

11. But the king will rejoice in God: Everyone who swears by him will glory; For the mouth of those who speak lies will be stopped.

## Psalms 64

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

2. Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;

3. Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,

4. That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly they shoot at him, and aren't afraid.

5. They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares secretly; They say, Who will see them?

6. They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, [they say], a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of a man is deep.

7. But God will shoot at them; With an arrow they will suddenly be wounded.

8. And they made their own tongue stumble against themselves: All who see them will wag the head.

9. And all of man will fear; And they will declare the work of God, And will wisely consider of his doing.

10. The righteous will be glad in Yahweh, and will take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart will glory.

## Psalms 65

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A song of David. Praise is due to you, O God, in Zion; And to you will the vow be performed.

2. O you who hear prayer, To you will all flesh come.

3. Iniquities prevail against me: As for our transgressions, you will forgive them.

4. Blessed is the man whom you choose, and cause to approach [to you] That he may stay in your courts: We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, Your holy temple.

5. By awesome things you will answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, You who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of those who are far off on the sea:

6. Who by his strength sets fast the mountains, Being girded about with might;

7. Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.

8. They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at your tokens: You make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

9. You visit the earth, and water it, You greatly enrich it; The river of God is full of water: You provide them grain, when you have so prepared the earth.

10. You soak its furrows; You settle its ridges: You make it soft with showers; You bless the springing of it.

11. You crown the year with your goodness; And your paths drop fatness.

12. They drop on the pastures of the wilderness; And the hills are girded with joy.

13. The pastures are clothed with flocks; The valleys also are covered over with grain; They shout for joy, they also sing.

## Psalms 66

1. For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth:

2. Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.

3. Say to God, How awesome are your works! Through the greatness of your power will your enemies submit themselves to you.

4. All the earth will worship you, And will sing to you; They will sing to your name. Selah.

5. Come, and see the works of God; [He is] awesome in his doing toward the sons of man.

6. He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There we rejoiced in him.

7. He rules by his might forever; His eyes observe the nations: Don't let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

8. Oh bless our God, you{+} peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard;

9. Who holds our soul in life, And does not allow our feet to be moved.

10. For you, O God, have proved us: You have tried us, as silver is tried.

11. You brought us into the net; You laid an intense burden on our loins.

12. You caused common man to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But you brought us out into abundance.

13. I will come into your house with burnt-offerings; I will pay you my vows,

14. Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.

15. I will offer to you burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

16. Come, and hear, all you{+} who fear God, And I will declare what he has done for my soul.

17. I cried to him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue.

18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear:

19. But truly God has heard; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.

20. Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor his loving-kindness from me.

6. The earth has yielded its increase: God, even our own God, will bless us.

7. God will bless us; And all the ends of the earth will fear him.

## Psalms 68

1. For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of David, a song. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; And let those who hate him flee before him.

2. As smoke is driven away, you will drive them away: As wax melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

3. But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God: Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.

4. Sing to God, sing praises to his name: Cast up a highway for him who rides through the deserts; His name is Yah; and exult{+} before him.

5. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, Is God in his holy habitation.

6. God sets the solitary in families: He brings out the prisoners into prosperity; But the rebellious stay in a parched land.

7. O God, when you went forth before your people, When you marched through the wilderness; Selah.

8. The earth trembled, The heavens also dropped [rain] at the presence of God: This Sinai [trembled] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

9. You, O God, sent a plentiful rain, You confirmed your inheritance, when it was weary.

10. Your congregation dwelt in it: You, O God, prepared of your goodness for the poor.

11. The Lord gives the word: The women who publish the good news are a great host.

12. Kings of armies flee, they flee; And she who tarries at home divides the spoil.

13. When you{+} lie among the sheepfolds, [It is as] the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.

14. When the Almighty scattered kings there, [It was as when] it snows in Zalmon.

15. A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.

16. Why do you{+} look askance, you{+} high mountains, At the mountain which God has desired for his dwelling place? Yes, Yahweh will stay [in it] forever.

17. The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands on thousands; The Lord is among them, [as in] Sinai, in the sanctuary.

18. You have ascended on high, you have led away captives; You have received gifts among man, Yes, [among] the rebellious also, that Yah God might stay [with them].

19. Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. Selah.

20. God is to us a God of deliverances; And to Yahweh the Lord belongs escape from death.

21. But God will strike through the head of his enemies, The hairy top of the head of such a one as goes on still in his guiltiness.

22. The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring [them] again from the depths of the sea;

23. That you may crush [them], [dipping] your foot in blood, That the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from [your] enemies.

24. They have seen your goings, O God, Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.

25. The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, In the midst of the young women playing with timbrels.

26. Bless{+} God in the congregations, Even the Lord, [you{+} who are] of the fountain of Israel.

27. There is little Benjamin their ruler, The princes of Judah [and] their council, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.

28. Your God has commanded your strength: Strengthen, O God, that which you have wrought for us.

29. Because of your temple at Jerusalem Kings will bring presents to you.

30. Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver: He has scattered the peoples who delight in war.

31. Bronze will come out of Egypt; Ethiopia will bring her hands [with tribute] in a hurry to God.

32. Sing to God, you{+} kingdoms of the earth; Oh sing praises to the Lord; Selah.

33. To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old; Look, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.

34. Ascribe{+} strength to God: His excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies.

35. O God, [you are] awesome out of your holy places: The God of Israel, he gives strength and power to [his] people. Blessed be God.

## Psalms 69

1. For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David. Save me, O God; For the waters have come in to my soul.

2. I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

3. I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: My eyes fail while I wait for my God.

4. Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: Those who would cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I did not take away I have to restore.

5. O God, you know my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from you.

6. Don't let those who wait for you be put to shame through me, O Sovereign Yahweh of hosts: Don't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.

7. Because for your sake I have borne reproach; Shame has covered my face.

8. I have become a stranger to my brothers, And an alien to my mother's sons.

9. For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; And the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.

10. When I wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.

11. When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.

12. Those who sit in the gate talk of me; And [I am] the song of the drunkards.

13. But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Yahweh, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of your loving-kindness, Answer me in the truth of your salvation.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink: Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Don't let the floodwater overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up; And don't let the pit shut its mouth on me.

16. Answer me, O Yahweh; for your loving-kindness is good: According to the multitude of your tender mercies turn to me.

17. And don't hide your face from your slave; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.

18. Draw near to my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of my enemies.

19. You know my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: My adversaries are all before you.

20. Reproach has broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.

21. They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

22. Let their table before them become a snare; And for the secure ones, [let it become] a trap.

23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see; And make their loins continually to shake.

24. Pour out your indignation on them, And let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.

25. Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.

26. For they persecute him whom you have struck; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom you have wounded.

27. Add iniquity to their iniquity; And don't let them come into your righteousness.

28. Let them be blotted out of the Book of Life, And not be written with the righteous.

29. But I am poor and sorrowful: Let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.

30. I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.

31. And it will please Yahweh better than an ox, [Or] a bull that has horns and hoofs.

32. The meek have seen it, and are glad: You{+} who seek after God, let your{+} heart live.

33. For Yahweh hears the needy, And does not despise his prisoners.

34. Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moves in them.

35. For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they will remain there, and have it in possession.

36. The seed also of his slaves will inherit it; And those who love his name will stay there.

## Psalms 70

1. For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David; to bring to remembrance. [Hurry], O God, to deliver me; Hurry to help me, O Yahweh.

2. Let them be put to shame and confounded That seek after my soul: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.

3. Let them be turned back by reason of their shame That say, Aha, aha.

4. Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; And let such as love your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

5. But I am poor and needy; Hurry to me, O God: You are my help and my deliverer; O Yahweh, make no tarrying.

## Psalms 71

1. In you, O Yahweh, I take refuge: Let me never be put to shame.

2. Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me: Bow down your ear to me, and save me.

3. Be to me a rock for my dwelling, to where I may continually resort: You have given commandment to save me; For you are my rock and my fortress.

4. Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

5. For you are my hope, O Sovereign Yahweh: [You are] my trust from my youth.

6. By you I have been held up from the womb; You are he who took me out of my mother's bowels: My praise will be continually of you.

7. I am as a wonder to many; But you are my strong refuge.

8. My mouth will be filled with your praise, And with your honor all the day.

9. Don't cast me off in the time of old age; Don't forsake me when my strength fails.

10. For my enemies speak concerning me; And those who watch for my soul take counsel together,

11. Saying, God has forsaken him: Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.

12. O God, don't be far from me; O my God, hurry to help me.

13. Let them be put to shame [and] consumed who are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope continually, And will praise you yet more and more.

15. My mouth will tell of your righteousness, [And] of your salvation all the day; For I don't know the numbers [of it].

16. I will come with the mighty acts of the Sovereign Yahweh: I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours only.

17. O God, you have taught me from my youth; And until now I have declared your wondrous works.

18. Yes, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, don't forsake me, Until I have declared your strength to [the next] generation, Your might to everyone who is to come.

19. Your righteousness also, O God, is very high; You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?

20. You, who have shown us many and intense troubles, Will quicken us again, And will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.

21. You will increase my greatness, And turn again and comfort me.

22. I will also praise you with the psaltery, [Even] your truth, O my God: To you I will sing praises with the harp, O you Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you; And my soul, which you have redeemed.

24. My tongue also will talk of your righteousness all the day long; For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.

## Psalms 72

1. [A Psalm] of Solomon. Give the king your judgments, O God, And your righteousness to the king's son.

2. He will judge your people with righteousness, And your poor with justice.

3. The mountains will bring peace to the people, And the hills, in righteousness.

4. He will judge the poor of the people, He will save the sons of the needy, And will break in pieces the oppressor.

5. May he endure as long as the sun, And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.

6. He will come down like rain on the mown grass, As showers that water the earth.

7. In his days will righteousness flourish, And abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.

8. He will have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.

9. Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before him; And his enemies will lick the dust.

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles will render tribute: The kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts.

11. Yes, all kings will fall down before him; All nations will serve him.

12. For he will deliver the needy when he cries, And the poor, that has no helper.

13. He will have pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he will save.

14. He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence; And precious will their blood be in his eyes:

15. And they will live; and to him will be given of the gold of Sheba: And men will pray for him continually; They will bless him all the day long.

16. There will be abundance of grain in the earth on the top of the mountains; The fruit of it will shake like Lebanon: And they of the city will flourish like grass of the earth.

17. His name will endure forever; His name will increase as long as the sun: And men will be blessed in him; All nations will call him happy.

18. Blessed be Yahweh God, the God of Israel, Who alone does wondrous things:

19. And blessed be his glorious name forever; And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.

20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse have ended.

## Psalms 73

1. BOOK III. A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, [Even] to such as are pure in heart.

2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well near slipped.

3. For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

4. For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.

5. They are not in trouble as common man; Neither are they plagued like man.

6. Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covers them as a garment.

7. Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.

8. They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.

9. They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth.

10. Therefore his people return here: And waters of a full [cup] are drained by them.

11. And they say, How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?

12. Look, these are the wicked; And, being always at ease, they increase in riches.

13. Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocence;

14. For all the day long I have been plagued, And chastened every morning.

15. If I had said, I will speak thus; Look, I would have betrayed the generation of your sons.

16. When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;

17. Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.

18. Surely you set them in slippery places: You cast them down to destruction.

19. How they have become a desolation in a moment! They are completely consumed with terrors.

20. As a dream when one awakes, So, O Lord, when you awake, you will despise their image.

21. For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:

22. So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was [as] a beast before you.

23. Nevertheless I am continually with you: You have held my right hand.

24. You will guide me with your counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.

25. Whom have I in heaven [but you] And there is none on earth that I desire besides you.

26. My flesh and my heart fails; [But] God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

27. For, look, those who are far from you will perish: You have destroyed all those prostituting from you.

28. But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have made the Sovereign Yahweh my refuge, That I may tell of all your works.

## Psalms 74

1. Maschil of Asaph. O God, why have you cast [us] off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?

2. Remember your congregation, which you have gotten of old, Which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance; [And] mount Zion, in which you have stayed.

3. Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.

4. Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.

5. They seemed as men who lifted up Axes on a thicket of trees.

6. And now all its carved work They break down with hatchet and hammers.

7. They have set your sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of your name [by casting it] to the ground.

8. They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

9. We don't see our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any who knows how long.

10. How long, O God, will the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?

11. Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? [Pluck it] out of your bosom [and] consume [them].

12. Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.

13. You divided the sea by your strength: You broke the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

14. You broke the heads of leviathan in pieces; You gave him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

15. You split fountain and flood: You dried up mighty rivers.

16. The day is yours, the night also is yours: You have prepared the light and the sun.

17. You have set all the borders of the earth: You have made summer and winter.

18. Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Yahweh, And that a foolish people has blasphemed your name.

19. Oh don't deliver the soul of your turtledove to the wild beast: Don't forget the life of your poor forever.

20. Have respect to the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.

21. Oh don't let the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise your name.

22. Arise, O God, plead your own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproaches you all the day.

23. Do not forget the voice of your adversaries: The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.

## Psalms 75

1. For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song. We give thanks to you, O God; We give thanks and call on your name: Men tell of your wondrous works.

2. When I will find the set time, I will judge uprightly.

3. The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah.

4. I said to the arrogant, Do not deal arrogantly; And to the wicked, Don't lift up the horn:

5. Don't lift up your{+} horn on high; Don't speak with a stiff neck.

6. For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, [comes] lifting up.

7. But God is the judge: He puts down one, and lifts up another.

8. For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, and the wine foams; It is an undiluted mixture, and he pours out of the same: Surely its dregs, all the wicked of the earth will drain them, and drink them.

9. But I will declare forever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. All the horns of the wicked also I will cut off; But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.

## Psalms 76

1. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.

2. In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.

3. There he broke the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

4. Glorious are you [and] excellent, From the everlasting mountains.

5. The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.

6. At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.

7. You, even you, are to be awed; And who may stand in your sight when once you are angry?

8. You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,

9. When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

10. Surely the wrath of man will praise you: The residue of wrath you will gird on you.

11. Vow, and pay to Yahweh your{+} God: Let all who are round about him bring presents to him who ought to be feared.

12. He will cut off the spirit of leaders: He is awesome to the kings of the earth.

## Psalms 77

1. For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry to God with my voice, Even to God with my voice; and he will give ear to me.

2. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand during the night [was] before him, and did not slack; My soul refused to be comforted.

3. I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.

4. You hold my eyes watching: I am so troubled that I can't speak.

5. I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.

6. I call to remembrance my song in the night: I sing with my own heart; And my spirit makes diligent search.

7. Will the Lord cast off forever? And will he be favorable no more?

8. Is his loving-kindness clean gone forever? Does his promise fail forevermore?

9. Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

10. And I said, This is my infirmity; [But I will remember] the years of the right hand of the Most High.

11. I will make mention of the deeds of Yah; For I will remember your wonders of old.

12. I will meditate also on all your work, And muse on your doings.

13. Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like God?

14. You are the God who does wonders: You have made known your strength among the peoples.

15. You have with your arm redeemed your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

16. The waters saw you, O God; The waters saw you, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.

17. The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Your arrows also went abroad.

18. The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.

19. Your way was in the sea, And your paths in the great waters, And your footsteps were not known.

20. You led your people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

1. Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your{+} ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will gush out dark sayings of old,

3. Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.

4. We will not hide them from their sons, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.

5. For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their sons;

6. That the generation to come might know [them], even the sons who should be born; Who should arise and tell [them] to their sons,

7. That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,

8. And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not set their heart aright, And whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

9. The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.

10. They did not keep the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;

11. And they forgot his doings, And his wondrous works that he had shown them.

12. He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13. He split the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.

14. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.

15. He split rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.

16. He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.

17. Yet they still went on to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.

18. And they tried God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.

19. Yes, they spoke against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

20. Look, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?

21. Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;

22. Because they did not believe in God, And did not trust in his salvation.

23. Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;

24. And he rained down manna on them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.

25. Man ate the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.

26. He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.

27. He rained flesh also on them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:

28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.

29. So they ate, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.

30. They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,

31. When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And struck down the young men of Israel.

32. For all this they sinned still, And did not believe in his wondrous works.

33. Therefore their days he consumed in vanity, And their years in terror.

34. When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.

35. And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.

36. But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied to him with their tongue.

37. For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.

38. But he, being merciful, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: Yes, many a time he turned his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.

39. And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passes away, and does not come again.

40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, And grieved him in the desert!

41. And they turned again and tried God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.

42. They did not remember his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;

43. How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,

44. And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.

45. He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.

46. He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust.

47. He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore-trees with frost.

48. He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

49. He cast on them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.

50. He made a path for his anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,

51. And struck all the firstborn in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.

52. But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

53. And he led them safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

54. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.

55. He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And caused the tribes of Israel to stay in their tents.

56. Yet they tried and rebelled against the Most High God, And did not keep his testimonies;

57. But turned back, and betrayed [him] like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

59. When God heard [this], he was angry, And greatly abhorred Israel;

60. So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he made a place to stay among man;

61. And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary's hand.

62. He gave his people over also to the sword, And was angry with his inheritance.

63. Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.

64. Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.

65. Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.

66. And he struck his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.

67. Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

68. But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.

69. And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he has established forever.

70. He chose David also his slave, And took him from the sheepfolds:

71. From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

72. So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

## Psalms 79

1. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; Your holy temple they have defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

2. The dead bodies of your slaves they have given to be food to the birds of the heavens, The flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.

3. Their blood they have shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.

4. We have become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to those who are round about us.

5. How long, O Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you, And on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.

7. For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.

8. Don't remember against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let your tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.

10. Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of your slaves which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight.

11. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you: According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are appointed to death;

12. And render to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, with which they have reproached you, O Lord.

13. So we your people and sheep of your pasture Will give you thanks forever: We will show forth your praise to all generations.

## Psalms 80

1. For the Chief Musician, set to Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who sit [above] the cherubim, shine forth.

2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might, And come to save us.

3. Turn us again, O God; And cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

4. O Yahweh God of hosts, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?

5. You have fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.

6. You make us a strife to our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.

7. Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

8. You brought a vine out of Egypt: You drove out the nations, and planted it.

9. You prepared [room] before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.

10. The mountains were covered with its shadow, And its boughs were [like] cedars of God.

11. It sent out its branches to the sea, And its shoots to the River.

12. Why have you broken down its walls, So that all those who pass by the way pluck it?

13. The boar out of the forest ravages it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.

14. Turn again, we urge you, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and look, and visit this vine,

15. And the stock which your right hand planted, And the son who you made strong for yourself.

16. It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of your countenance.

17. Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, On the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.

18. So we will not go back from you: Quicken us, and we will call on your name.

19. Turn us again, O Yahweh God of hosts; Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

## Psalms 81

1. For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength: Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.

2. Raise a song, and bring here the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery.

3. Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day.

4. For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.

5. He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, [Where] I heard a language that I did not know.

6. I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket.

7. You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

8. Hear, O my people, and I will testify to you: O Israel, if you would listen to me!

9. There will be no strange god in you; Neither will you worship any foreign god.

10. I am Yahweh your God, Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt: Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But my people did not listen to my voice; And Israel did not want me.

12. So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.

13. Oh that my people would listen to me, That Israel would walk in my ways!

14. I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries.

15. The haters of Yahweh should submit themselves to him: But their time should endure forever.

16. He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock I would satisfy you.

## Psalms 82

1. A Psalm of Asaph. God stands in the congregation of God; He judges among the gods.

2. How long will you{+} judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? Selah.

3. Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.

4. Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.

5. They don't know, neither do they understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6. I said, You{+} are gods, And all of you{+} are sons of the Most High.

7. Nevertheless you{+} will die like man, And fall like one of the princes.

8. Arise, O God, judge the earth; For you will inherit all the nations.

## Psalms 83

1. A song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, don't keep your silence: Don't hold your peace, and don't be still, O God.

2. For, look, your enemies make a tumult; And those who hate you have lifted up the head.

3. They take crafty counsel against your people, And consult together against your hidden ones.

4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

5. For they have consulted together with one consent; Against you they make a covenant:

6. The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;

7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:

8. Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the sons of Lot. Selah.

9. Do to them as to Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;

10. Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.

11. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;

12. Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.

13. O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.

14. As the fire that burns the forest, And as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,

15. So pursue them with your tempest, And terrify them with your storm.

16. Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek your name, O Yahweh.

17. Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; Yes, let them be confounded and perish;

18. That they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, Are the Most High over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

1. For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable are your tabernacles, O Yahweh of hosts!

2. My soul longs, yes, even faints for the courts of Yahweh; My heart and my flesh cry out to the living God.

3. Yes, the sparrow has found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even your altars, O Yahweh of hosts, My King, and my God.

4. Blessed are those who dwell in your house: They will still be praising you. Selah.

5. Blessed is [the] man whose strength is in you; In whose heart are the highways [to Zion].

6. Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yes, the early rain covers it with blessings.

7. They go from strength to strength; The God of gods will be seen in Zion.

8. O Yahweh God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

9. Look, O God our shield, And look at the face of your anointed.

10. For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield: Yahweh will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from those who walk uprightly.

12. O Yahweh of hosts, Blessed is [the] man who trusts in you.

## Psalms 85

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land; You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.

2. You have forgiven the iniquity of your people; You have covered all their sin. Selah.

3. You have taken away all your wrath; You have turned [yourself] from the fierceness of your anger.

4. Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause your indignation toward us to cease.

5. Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?

6. Will you not quicken us again, That your people may rejoice in you?

7. Show us your loving-kindness, O Yahweh, And grant us your salvation.

8. I will hear what God Yahweh will speak; For he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints: But don't let them turn again to folly.

9. Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, That glory may stay in our land.

10. Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

11. Truth springs out of the earth; And righteousness has looked down from heaven.

12. Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good; And our land will yield its increase.

13. Righteousness will go before him, And will make his footsteps a way [to walk in].

## Psalms 86

1. A Prayer of David Bow down your ear, O Yahweh, and answer me; For I am poor and needy.

2. Preserve my soul; for I am godly: O you my God, save your slave who trusts in you.

3. Be merciful to me, O Lord; For to you I cry all the day long.

4. Rejoice the soul of your slave; For to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

5. For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in loving-kindness to all those who call on you.

6. Give ear, O Yahweh, to my prayer; And listen to the voice of my supplications.

7. In the day of my trouble I will call on you; For you will answer me.

8. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; Neither [are there any works] like your works.

9. All nations whom you have made will come and worship before you, O Lord; And they will glorify your name.

10. For you are great, and do wondrous things: You alone are God.

11. Teach me your way, O Yahweh; I will walk in your truth: Unite my heart to fear your name.

12. I will praise you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; And I will glorify your name forevermore.

13. For great is your loving-kindness toward me; And you have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

14. O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, And have not set you before them.

15. But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.

16. Oh turn to me, and have mercy on me; Give your strength to your male slave, And save the son of your female slave.

17. Show me a token for good, That those who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, Because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.

## Psalms 87

1. A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2. Yahweh loves the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.

4. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among those who know me: Look, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This [man] was born there.

5. Yes, of Zion it will be said, This man and that man were born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her.

6. Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, This [man] was born there. Selah.

7. Those who sing as well as those who dance [will say] All my fountains are in you.

## Psalms 88

1. A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you.

2. Let my prayer enter into your presence; Incline your ear to my cry.

3. For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draws near to Sheol.

4. I am reckoned with those who go down into the pit; I am as an [able-bodied] man without strength,

5. Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom you remember no more, And they are cut off from your hand.

6. You have laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps.

7. Your wrath lies hard on me, And you have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.

8. You have put my acquaintances far from me; You have made me disgusting to them: I am shut up, and I can't come forth.

9. My eye wastes away by reason of affliction: I have called daily on you, O Yahweh; I have spread forth my hands to you.

10. Will you show wonders to the dead? Will the spirits of the dead arise and praise you? Selah.

11. Will your loving-kindness be declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?

12. Will your wonders be known in the dark? And your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

13. But to you, O Yahweh, I have cried; And in the morning my prayer will come before you.

14. Yahweh, why do you cast off my soul? Why do you hide your face from me?

15. I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: While I suffer your terrors I am distracted.

16. Your fierce wrath has gone over me; Your terrors have cut me off.

17. They came round about me like water all the day long; They surrounded me together.

18. Lover and companion you have put far from me, My acquaintances into darkness.

## Psalms 89

1. Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the loving-kindness of Yahweh forever: With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.

2. For I have said, Mercy will be built up forever; Your faithfulness you will establish in the very heavens.

3. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn to David my slave:

4. Your seed I will establish forever, And build up your throne to all generations. Selah.

5. And the heavens will praise your wonders, O Yahweh; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

6. For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? Who among the sons of the mighty is like Yahweh,

7. A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be awed above all those who are round about him?

8. O Yahweh God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like you, O Yah? And your faithfulness is round about you.

9. You rule the pride of the sea: When its waves arise, you still them.

10. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered your enemies with the arm of your strength.

11. The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours: The world and the fullness of it, you have founded them.

12. The north and the south, you have created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.

13. You have a mighty arm; Strong is your hand, and high is your right hand.

14. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne: Loving-kindness and truth go before your face.

15. Blessed is the people who know the joyful sound: They walk, O Yahweh, in the light of your countenance.

16. In your name they rejoice all the day; And in your righteousness they stand.

17. For you are the glory of their strength; And in your favor our horn will be exalted.

18. For our shield belongs to Yahweh; And our king to the Holy One of Israel.

19. Then you spoke in vision to your saints, And said, I have laid help on one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.

20. I have found David my slave; With my holy oil I have anointed him:

21. With whom my hand will be established; My arm also will strengthen him.

22. The enemy will not exact from him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

23. And I will beat down his adversaries before him, And strike those who hate him.

24. But my faithfulness and my loving-kindness will be with him; And in my name will his horn be exalted.

25. I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.

26. He will cry to me, You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.

27. I also will make him [my] firstborn, The highest of the kings of the earth.

28. My loving-kindness I will keep for him forevermore; And my covenant will stand fast with him.

29. His seed also I will make to endure forever, And his throne as the days of heaven.

30. If his sons forsake my law, And don't walk in my ordinances;

31. If they break my statutes, And don't keep my commandments;

32. Then I will visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.

33. But my loving-kindness I will not completely take from him, Nor allow my faithfulness to fail.

34. My covenant I will not break, Nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips.

35. Once I have sworn by my holiness: I will not lie to David:

36. His seed will endure forever, And his throne as the sun before me.

37. It will be established forever as the moon, And [as] the faithful witness in the sky. Selah.

38. But you have cast off and rejected, You have been angry with your anointed.

39. You have abhorred the covenant of your slave: You have profaned his crown [by casting it] to the ground.

40. You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

41. All who pass by the way rob him: He has become a reproach to his neighbors.

42. You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; You have made all his enemies to rejoice.

43. Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, And have not made him to stand in the battle.

44. You have made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.

45. The days of his youth you have shortened: You have covered him with shame. Selah.

46. How long, O Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? [How long] will your wrath burn like fire?

47. Remember me: How short is my lifetime? For what vanity have you created all the sons of man?

48. What [prominent] man is he who will live and not see death, That will deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.

49. Lord, where are your former loving-kindnesses, Which you swore to David in your faithfulness?

50. Remember, Lord, the reproach of your slaves, That I bear in my bosom from all the numerous peoples,

51. With which your enemies have reproached, O Yahweh, With which they have reproached the footsteps of your anointed.

52. Blessed be Yahweh forevermore. Amen, and Amen.

## Psalms 90

1. BOOK IV. A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, you have been our dwelling-place In all generations.

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, Or you had ever formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.

3. You turn common man to destruction, And say, Return, you{+} sons of man.

4. For a thousand years in your sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.

5. You carry them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which grows up.

6. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up; In the evening it is cut down, and withers.

7. For we are consumed in your anger, And in your wrath are we troubled.

8. You have set our iniquities before you, Our secret sins in the light of your countenance.

9. For all our days are passed away in your wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh.

10. The days of our years are seventy years, Or even by reason of strength eighty years; Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away.

11. Who knows the power of your anger, And your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?

12. So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom.

13. Return, O Yahweh; how long? And let it repent you concerning your slaves.

14. Oh satisfy us in the morning with your loving-kindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

15. Make us glad according to the days in which you have afflicted us, And the years in which we have seen evil.

16. Let your work appear to your slaves, And your glory on their sons.

17. And let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; And establish the work of our hands on us; Yes, the work of our hands establish it.

## Psalms 91

1. He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Will reside under the shadow of the Almighty.

2. I will say of Yahweh, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.

3. For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, And from the word of calamity.

4. He will cover you with his pinions, And under his wings you will take refuge: His truth is a shield and a buckler.

5. You will not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flies by day;

6. For the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.

7. A thousand will fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; [But] it will not come near you.

8. Only with your eyes you will look, And see the reward of the wicked.

9. For you, O Yahweh, are my refuge! You have made the Most High your habitation;

10. No evil will befall you, Neither will any plague come near your tent.

11. For he will give his angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways.

12. They will bear you up in their hands, Or else you would dash your foot against a stone.

13. You will tread on the lion and cobra: The young lion and the serpent you will trample under foot.

14. Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him: I will set him on high, because he has known my name.

15. He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him.

16. With long life I will satisfy him, And show him my salvation.

## Psalms 92

1. A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, And to sing praises to your name, O Most High;

2. To show forth your loving-kindness in the morning, And your faithfulness every night,

3. With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound on the harp.

4. For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work: I will triumph in the works of your hands.

5. How great are your works, O Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep.

6. A brutish man does not know; Neither does a fool understand this:

7. When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity flourish; It is that they will be destroyed forever.

8. But you, O Yahweh, are on high forevermore.

9. For, look, your enemies, O Yahweh, For, look, your enemies will perish; All the workers of iniquity will be scattered.

10. But my horn you have exalted like [the horn of] the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.

11. My eye also has seen my enemies, My ears have heard the evildoers that rise up against me.

12. The righteous will flourish like the palm-tree: He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13. They are planted in the house of Yahweh; They will flourish in the courts of our God.

14. They will still bring forth fruit in old age; They will be full of sap and green:

15. To show that Yahweh is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

## Psalms 93

1. Yahweh reigns; he is clothed with majesty; Yahweh is clothed with strength; he has girded himself with it: Indeed, the world will be established, it will not be moved.

2. Your throne is established of old: You are from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up, O Yahweh, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.

4. Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty.

5. Your testimonies are very sure: Holiness becomes your house, O Yahweh, forevermore.

## Psalms 94

1. O Yahweh, God to whom vengeance belongs, God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.

2. Lift up yourself, Judge of the earth: Render to the proud [their] desert.

3. Yahweh, how long will the wicked, How long will the wicked triumph?

4. They gush out, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.

5. They break in pieces your people, O Yahweh, And afflict your heritage.

6. They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless.

7. And they say, Yah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider.

8. Consider, you{+} brutish among the people; And you{+} fools, when will you{+} be wise?

9. He who planted the ear, will he not hear? He who formed the eye, will he not see?

10. He who chastises the nations, will not he correct, [Even] he who teaches man knowledge?

11. Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.

12. Blessed is the [noble] man whom you chasten, O Yah, And teach out of your law;

13. That you may give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit is dug for the wicked.

14. For Yahweh will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.

15. For judgment will return to righteousness; And all the upright in heart will follow it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

17. Unless Yahweh had been my help, My soul would have soon stayed in silence.

18. When I said, My foot slips; Your loving-kindness, O Yahweh, held me up.

19. In the multitude of my thoughts inside me Your comforts delight my soul.

20. Will the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, Which frames mischief by statute?

21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.

22. But Yahweh has been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.

23. And he has brought on them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Yahweh our God will cut them off.

## Psalms 95

1. Oh come, let us sing to Yahweh; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise to him with psalms.

3. For Yahweh is a great God, And a great King above all gods.

4. In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.

5. The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land.

6. Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Yahweh our Maker:

7. For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, oh that you{+} would hear his voice!

8. Do not harden your{+} heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;

9. When your{+} fathers tried me, Proved me, and saw my work.

10. Forty years long I was grieved with [that] generation, And said, It is a people who errs in their heart, And they have not known my ways:

11. Therefore I swore in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.

## Psalms 96

1. Oh sing to Yahweh a new song: Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.

2. Sing to Yahweh, bless his name; Proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.

3. Declare his glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples.

4. For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised: He is to be awed above all gods.

5. For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Yahweh made the heavens.

6. Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

7. Ascribe to Yahweh, you{+} kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.

8. Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts.

9. Oh worship Yahweh in holy array: Tremble before him, all the earth.

10. Say among the nations, Yahweh reigns: Indeed, the world will be established, it will not be moved: He will judge the peoples with equity.

11. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it;

12. Let the field exult, and all that is in it; Then will all the trees of the forest sing for joy

13. Before Yahweh; for he comes, For he comes to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth.

## Psalms 97

1. Yahweh reigns; let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad.

2. Clouds and darkness are round about him: Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

3. A fire goes before him, And burns up his adversaries round about.

4. His lightnings lightened the world: The earth saw, and trembled.

5. The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Yahweh, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

6. The heavens declare his righteousness, And all the peoples have seen his glory.

7. Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all you{+} gods.

8. Zion heard and was glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoiced, Because of your judgments, O Yahweh.

9. For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth: You are exalted far above all gods.

10. O you{+} who love Yahweh, hate evil: He preserves the souls of his saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.

12. Be glad in Yahweh, you{+} righteous; And give thanks to his holy memorial [name].

## Psalms 98

1. A Psalm. Oh sing to Yahweh a new song; For he has done marvelous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, has wrought salvation for him.

2. Yahweh has made known his salvation: His righteousness he has openly shown in the sight of the nations.

3. He has remembered his loving-kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

4. Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yes, sing praises.

5. Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody.

6. With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh.

7. Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it; The world, and those who dwell in it;

8. Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together

9. Before Yahweh; for he comes to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.

## Psalms 99

1. Yahweh reigns; let the peoples tremble: He sits [above] the cherubim; let the earth be moved.

2. Yahweh is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples.

3. Let them praise your great and awesome name: He is holy.

4. The king's strength also loves justice; You establish equity; You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.

5. Exalt{+} Yahweh our God, And worship at his footstool: He is holy.

6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among those who call on his name; They called on Yahweh, and he answered them.

7. He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them.

8. You answered them, O Yahweh our God: You were a God who forgave them, Though you took vengeance of their doings.

9. Exalt{+} Yahweh our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Yahweh our God is holy.

## Psalms 100

1. A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all you{+} lands.

2. Serve Yahweh with gladness: Come before his presence with singing.

## Psalms 101

1. A Psalm of David. I will sing of loving-kindness and justice: To you, O Yahweh, I will sing praises.

2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when will you come to me? I will walk inside my house with a perfect heart.

3. I will set no base thing before my eyes: I hate the work of those who turn aside; It will not stick to me.

4. A perverse heart will depart from me: I will know no evil thing.

5. Whoever secretly slanders his fellow man, I will destroy him: I will not allow him who has a high look and a proud heart.

6. My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He who walks in a perfect way, he will minister to me.

7. He who works deceit will not dwell inside my house: He who speaks falsehood will not be established before my eyes.

8. Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Yahweh.

## Psalms 102

1. A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before Yahweh. Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, And let my cry come to you.

2. Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress: Incline your ear to me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.

3. For my days consume away in smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand.

4. My heart is struck like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread.

5. By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones stick to my flesh.

6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I have become as an owl of the waste places.

7. I watch, and have become like a sparrow That is alone on the housetop.

8. My enemies reproach me all the day; Those who are insane against me curse by me.

9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,

10. Because of your indignation and your wrath: For you have taken me up, and cast me away.

11. My days are like a shadow that declines; And I am withered like grass.

12. But you, O Yahweh, will remain forever; And your memorial [name] to all generations.

13. You will arise, and have mercy on Zion; For it is time to have pity on her, Yes, the set time has come.

14. For your slaves take pleasure in her stones, And have pity on her dust.

15. So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh, And all the kings of the earth your glory.

16. For Yahweh has built up Zion; He has appeared in his glory.

17. He has regarded the prayer of the destitute, And has not despised their prayer.

18. This will be written for the generation to come; And a people which will be created will praise Yah.

19. For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven Yahweh looked at the earth;

20. To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those who are appointed to death;

21. That men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;

22. When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.

23. He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.

24. I said, O my God, don't take me away in the midst of my days: Your years are throughout all generations.

25. Of old did you lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of your hands.

26. They will perish, but you will endure; Yes, all of them will wax old like a garment; As a vesture you will change them, and they will be changed:

27. But you are the same, And your years will have no end.

28. The sons of your slaves will stay, And their seed will be established before you.

## Psalms 103

1. [A Psalm] of David. Bless Yahweh, O my soul; And all that is inside me, [bless] his holy name.

2. Bless Yahweh, O my soul, And do not forget all his benefits:

3. Who forgives all your iniquities; Who heals all your diseases;

4. Who redeems your life from destruction; Who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies;

5. Who satisfies your desire with good things, [So that] your vitality is renewed like the eagle.

6. Yahweh executes righteous acts, And judgments for all who are oppressed.

7. He made known his ways to Moses, His doings to the sons of Israel.

8. Yahweh is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness.

9. He will not always chide; Neither will he keep [his anger] forever.

10. He has not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.

11. For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his loving-kindness toward those who fear him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, So far has he removed our transgressions from us.

13. Like a father pities his sons, So Yahweh pities those who fear him.

14. For he knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.

15. As for common man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; And its place will know it no more.

17. But the loving-kindness of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, And his righteousness to sons of sons;

18. To such as keep his covenant, And to those who remember his precepts to do them.

19. Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom rules over all.

20. Bless Yahweh, you{+} his angels, Who are mighty in strength, that fulfill his word, Listening to the voice of his word.

21. Bless Yahweh, all you{+} his hosts, You{+} ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

22. Bless Yahweh, all you{+} his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Yahweh, O my soul.

## Psalms 104

1. Bless Yahweh, O my soul. O Yahweh my God, you are very great; You are clothed with honor and majesty:

2. Covering yourself with light as with a garment; Stretching out the heavens like a curtain;

3. Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who makes the clouds his chariot; Who walks on the wings of the wind;

4. Who makes winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;

5. Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved forever.

6. You covered it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.

7. At your rebuke they fled; At the voice of your thunder they hurried away

8. (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) To the place which you had founded for them.

9. You have set a bound that they may not pass over; That they don't turn again to cover the earth.

10. He sends forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;

11. They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst.

12. By them the birds of the heavens stay; They sing among the branches.

13. He waters the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.

14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,

15. And wine that makes glad the heart of common man, [And] oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengthens common man's heart.

16. The trees of Yahweh are filled [with moisture] The cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;

17. Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, on their top are her house.

18. The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.

19. He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knows his going down.

20. You make darkness, and it is night, In which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

21. The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.

22. The sun rises, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.

23. Man goes forth to his work And to his labor until the evening.

24. O Yahweh, how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all: The earth is full of your riches.

25. Yonder is the sea, great and wide, In which are innumerable creeping things, Both small and great beasts.

26. There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom you have formed to play in it.

27. These all wait for you, That you may give them their food in due season.

28. You give to them, they gather; You open your hand, they are satisfied with good.

29. You hide your face, they are troubled; You take away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.

30. You send forth your Spirit, they are created; And you renew the face of the ground.

31. Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever; Let Yahweh rejoice in his works:

32. Who looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.

33. I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.

34. Let your meditation be sweet to him: I will rejoice in Yahweh.

35. Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Yahweh, O my soul. Hallelujah.

## Psalms 105

1. Oh give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.

2. Sing to him, sing praises to him; Talk{+} of all his marvelous works.

3. Glory{+} in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Yahweh.

4. Seek{+} Yahweh and his strength; Seek his face evermore.

5. Remember his marvelous works that he has done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

6. O you{+} seed of Abraham his slave, You{+} sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.

7. He is Yahweh our God: His judgments are in all the earth.

8. He has remembered his covenant forever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

9. [The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath to Isaac,

10. And confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,

11. Saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, The lot of your{+} inheritance;

12. When they were but a few men in number, Yes, very few, and sojourners in it.

13. And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.

14. He did not allow man to do them wrong; Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,

15. [Saying,] Don't touch my anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.

16. And he called for a famine on the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.

17. He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave:

18. His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in [chains of] iron,

19. Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Yahweh tried him.

20. The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.

21. He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;

22. To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.

23. Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.

25. He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his slaves.

26. He sent Moses his slave, [And] Aaron whom he had chosen.

27. They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they did not rebel against his words.

29. He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.

30. Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.

32. He gave them hail for rain, [And] flaming fire in their land.

33. He struck their vines also and their fig-trees, And broke the trees of their borders.

34. He spoke, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,

35. And ate up every herb in their land, And ate up the fruit of their ground.

36. He struck also all the firstborn in their land, The chief of all their strength.

37. And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen on them.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.

40. They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

41. He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places [like] a river.

42. For he remembered his holy word, [And] Abraham his slave.

43. And he brought forth his people with joy, [And] his chosen with singing.

44. And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:

45. That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Hallelujah.

## Psalms 106

1. Hallelujah. Oh give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

2. Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, Or show forth all his praise?

3. Blessed are those who keep justice, And he who does righteousness at all times.

4. Remember me, O Yahweh, with the favor that you bear to your people; Oh visit me with your salvation,

5. That I may see the prosperity of your chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, That I may glory with your inheritance.

6. We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers did not understand your wonders in Egypt; They did not remember the multitude of your loving-kindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

8. Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.

9. He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.

10. And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11. And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.

12. Then they believed his words; They sang his praise.

13. They soon forgot his works; They did not wait for his counsel,

14. But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tried God in the desert.

15. And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.

16. They envied Moses also in the camp, [And] Aaron the saint of Yahweh.

17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.

18. And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, And worshiped a molten image.

20. Thus they exchanged their glory For the likeness of an ox that eats grass.

21. They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,

22. Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [And] awesome works by the Red Sea.

23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].

24. Yes, they despised the pleasant land, They did not believe his word,

25. But murmured in their tents, And did not listen to the voice of Yahweh.

26. Therefore he swore to them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,

27. And that he would cast down their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.

28. They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.

29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague broke in on them.

30. Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stopped.

31. And that was reckoned to him for righteousness, To all generations forevermore.

32. They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;

33. Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.

34. They did not destroy the peoples, As Yahweh commanded them,

35. But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,

36. And served their idols, Which became a snare to them.

37. Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,

38. And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.

39. Thus they were defiled with their works, And prostituted in their doings.

40. Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was kindled against his people, And he was disgusted with his inheritance.

41. And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And those who hated them ruled over them.

42. Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.

43. Many times he delivered them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.

44. Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:

45. And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.

46. He made them also to be pitied Of all those who carried them captive.

47. Save us, O Yahweh our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to your holy name, And to triumph in your praise.

48. Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah.

## Psalms 107

1. BOOK V. O give thanks to Yahweh; For he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

2. Let the redeemed of Yahweh say [so] Whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,

3. And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the west.

4. They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.

5. Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.

6. Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,

7. He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.

8. Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!

9. For he satisfies the longing soul, And the hungry soul he fills with good.

10. Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,

11. Because they rebelled against the words of God, And despised the counsel of the Most High:

12. Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.

13. Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.

14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their bonds in sunder.

15. Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!

16. For he has broken the gates of bronze, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.

17. Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

18. Their soul is disgusted by all manner of food; And they draw near to the gates of death.

19. Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, And he saves them out of their distresses.

20. He sends his word, and heals them, And delivers [them] from their destructions.

21. Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!

22. And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.

23. Those who go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;

24. These see the works of Yahweh, And his wonders in the deep.

25. For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up its waves.

26. They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melts away because of trouble.

27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunk man, And are at their wits' end.

28. Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, And he brings them out of their distresses.

29. He makes the storm be calm, So that its waves are still.

30. Then they are glad because they are quiet; So he brings them to their desired haven.

31. Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!

32. Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.

33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;

34. A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

35. He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.

36. And there he makes the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,

37. And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get fruits of increase.

38. He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he does not allow their cattle to decrease.

39. Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.

40. He pours contempt on princes, And causes them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.

41. Yet he sets the needy on high from affliction, And makes [him] families like a flock.

42. The upright will see it, and be glad; And all iniquity will stop her mouth.

43. Whoever is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the loving-kindnesses of Yahweh.

## Psalms 108

1. A Song, A Psalm of David. My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises, even with my glory.

2. Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake the dawn.

3. I will give thanks to you, O Yahweh, among the peoples; And I will sing praises to you among the nations.

4. For your loving-kindness is great above the heavens; And your truth [reaches] to the skies.

5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And your glory above all the earth.

6. That your beloved may be delivered, Save with your right hand, and answer me.

7. God has spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defense of my head; Judah is my scepter.

9. Moab is my washpot; On Edom I will cast my sandal; Over Philistia I will shout.

10. Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?

11. Haven't you cast us off, O God? And you don't go forth, O God, with our hosts.

12. Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.

13. Through God we will do valiantly: For it is he who will tread down our adversaries.

## Psalms 109

1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Don't hold your peace, O God of my praise;

2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit they have opened against me: They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.

3. They have surrounded me also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.

4. In return for my love they are my adversaries: But I [give myself to] prayer.

5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.

6. Set a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.

7. When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.

8. Let his days be few; [And] let another take his office.

9. Let his sons be fatherless, And his wife a widow.

10. Let his sons be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek [their bread] out of their desolate places.

11. Let the extortioner catch all that he has; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.

12. Let there be none to extend kindness to him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.

13. Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.

14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Yahweh; And don't let the sin of his mother be blotted out.

15. Let them be before Yahweh continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;

16. Because he did not remember to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay [them].

17. Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him; And he did not delight in blessing, and it was far from him.

18. He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.

19. Let it be to him as the raiment with which he covers himself, And for the belt with which he is girded continually.

20. This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, And of those who speak evil against my soul.

21. But deal with me, O Yahweh the Lord, for your name's sake: Because your loving-kindness is good, deliver me;

22. For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded inside me.

23. I am gone like the shadow when it declines: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

24. My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh fails of fatness.

25. I have also become a reproach to them: When they see me, they shake their head.

26. Help me, O Yahweh my God; Oh save me according to your loving-kindness:

27. That they may know that this is your hand; [That] you, Yahweh, have done it.

28. Let them curse, but you bless: When they arise, they will be put to shame, But your slave will rejoice.

29. Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.

30. I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth; Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.

31. For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from those who judge his soul.

## Psalms 110

1. A Psalm of David. Yahweh says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.

2. The rod of your strength Yahweh will send forth out of Zion: Rule in the midst of your enemies.

3. With you is princely dignity in the day of your power, on the holy mountains; Like dew from the womb of the dawn, I have begotten you.

4. Yahweh has sworn, and will not repent: You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

5. The Lord at your right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.

6. He will judge among the nations, He will fill [the places] with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries.

7. He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore he will lift up the head.

## Psalms 111

1. Hallelujah. I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.

2. The works of Yahweh are great, Sought out of all those who have pleasure in them.

3. His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endures forever.

4. He has made his wonderful works to be remembered: Yahweh is gracious and merciful.

5. He has given food to those who fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.

6. He has shown his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.

7. The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.

8. They are established forever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.

9. He has sent redemption to his people; He has commanded his covenant forever: Holy and awesome is his name.

10. The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do that: His praise endures forever.

## Psalms 112

1. Hallelujah. Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh, That delights greatly in his commandments.

2. His seed will be mighty on earth: The generation of the upright will be blessed.

3. Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endures forever.

4. To the upright there rises light in the darkness: [He is] gracious, and merciful, and righteous.

5. It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends; He will maintain his cause in judgment.

6. For he will never be moved; The righteous will be had in everlasting remembrance.

7. He will not be afraid of evil news: His heart is fixed, trusting in Yahweh.

8. His heart is established, he will not be afraid, Until he sees [his desire] on his adversaries.

9. He has dispersed, he has given to the needy; His righteousness endures forever: His horn will be exalted with honor.

10. The wicked will see it, and be grieved; He will gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked will perish.

## Psalms 113

1. Hallelujah. Praise, O you{+} slaves of Yahweh, Praise the name of Yahweh.

2. Blessed be the name of Yahweh From this time forth and forevermore.

3. From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same Yahweh's name is to be praised.

4. Yahweh is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens.

5. Who is like Yahweh our God, That has his seat on high,

6. That humbles himself to look at [The things that are] in heaven and in the earth?

7. He raises up the poor out of the dust, And lifts up the needy from the dunghill;

8. That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.

9. He makes the barren woman to keep house, [And to be] a joyful mother of sons. Hallelujah.

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

2. Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.

3. The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back.

4. The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.

5. What ails you, O you sea, that you flee? You Jordan, that you turn back?

6. You{+} mountains, that you{+} skip like rams; You{+} little hills, like lambs?

7. Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,

8. Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.

## Psalms 115

1. Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, But to your name give glory, For your loving-kindness, and for your truth's sake.

2. Why should the nations say, Where now is their God?

3. But our God is in the heavens: He has done whatever he pleased.

4. Their idols are silver and gold, The work of man's hands.

5. They have mouths, but they don't speak; They have eyes, but they don't see;

6. They have ears, but they don't hear; They have noses, but they don't smell;

7. They have hands, but they don't handle; They have feet, but they don't walk; Neither do they speak through their throat.

8. Those who make them will be like them; Yes, everyone who trusts in them.

9. O Israel, trust in Yahweh: He is their help and their shield.

10. O house of Aaron, trust{+} in Yahweh: He is their help and their shield.

11. You{+} who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh: He is their help and their shield.

12. Yahweh has been mindful of us; he will bless [us] He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.

13. He will bless those who fear Yahweh, Both small and great.

14. Yahweh will increase you{+} more and more, You{+} and your{+} sons.

15. Blessed are you{+} of Yahweh, Who made heaven and earth.

16. The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; But the earth he has given to the sons of man.

17. The dead don't praise Yah, Neither any who go down into silence;

18. But we will bless Yah From this time forth and forevermore. Hallelujah.

## Psalms 116

1. I love Yahweh, because he hears My voice and my supplications.

2. Because he has inclined his ear to me, Therefore I will call [on him] as long as I live.

3. The cords of death surrounded me, And the pains of Sheol got hold on me: I found trouble and sorrow.

4. Then I called on the name of Yahweh: O Yahweh, I urge you, deliver my soul.

5. Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; Yes, our God is merciful.

6. Yahweh preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.

7. Return to your rest, O my soul; For Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.

8. For you have delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, [And] my feet from falling.

9. I will walk before Yahweh In the land of the living.

10. I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted:

11. I said in my haste, Everyone of man is a liar.

12. What shall I render to Yahweh For all his benefits toward me?

13. I will take the cup of salvation, And call on the name of Yahweh.

14. I will pay my vows to Yahweh, Yes, in the presence of all his people.

15. Precious in the sight of Yahweh Is the death of his saints.

16. O Yahweh, truly I am your slave: I am your slave, the son of your female slave; You have loosed my bonds.

17. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call on the name of Yahweh.

18. I will pay my vows to Yahweh, Yes, in the presence of all his people,

19. In the courts of Yahweh's house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.

## Psalms 117

2. For his loving-kindness is great toward us; And the truth of Yahweh [endures] forever. Hallelujah.

## Psalms 118

1. Oh give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

2. Let Israel now say, That his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

3. Let the house of Aaron now say, That his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

4. Let them now that fear Yahweh say, That his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

5. Out of my distress I called on Yah: Yah answered me [and set me] in a large place.

6. Yahweh is on my side; I will not fear: What can man do to me?

7. Yahweh is on my side among those who help me: Therefore I will see [my desire] on those who hate me.

8. It is better to take refuge in Yahweh Than to put confidence in man.

9. It is better to take refuge in Yahweh Than to put confidence in princes.

10. All nations surrounded me: In the name of Yahweh I will cut them off.

11. They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me: In the name of Yahweh I will cut them off.

12. They surrounded me like bees; They are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Yahweh I will cut them off.

13. You thrusted intensely at me that I might fall; But Yahweh helped me.

14. Yah is my strength and song; And he has become my salvation.

15. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.

16. The right hand of Yahweh is exalted: The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.

17. I will not die, but live, And declare the works of Yah.

18. Yah has chastened me intensely; But he has not given me over to death.

19. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks to Yah.

20. This is the gate of Yahweh; The righteous will enter into it.

21. I will give thanks to you; for you have answered me, And have become my salvation.

22. The stone which the builders rejected Has become the head of the corner.

23. This is Yahweh's doing; It is marvelous in our eyes.

24. This is the day which Yahweh has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.

25. Save now, we urge you, O Yahweh: O Yahweh, we urge you, send now prosperity.

26. Blessed be he who comes in the name of Yahweh: We have blessed you{+} out of the house of Yahweh.

27. Yahweh is God, and he has given us light: Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.

28. You are my God, and I will give thanks to you: You are my God, I will exalt you.

29. Oh give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.

## Psalms 119

1. [ALEPH] Blessed are those who are perfect in the way, Who walk in the law of Yahweh.

2. Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, That seek him with the whole heart.

3. Yes, they do no unrighteousness; They walk in his ways.

19. I am a sojourner in the earth: Don't hide your commandments from me.

20. My soul breaks for the longing That it has to your ordinances at all times.

21. You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, That wander from your commandments.

22. Take away from me reproach and contempt; For I have kept your testimonies.

23. Princes also sat and talked against me; [But] your slave meditated on your statutes.

24. Your testimonies also are my delight [And] my counselors.

25. [DALET] My soul sticks to the dust: Quicken me according to your word.

26. I declared my ways, and you answered me: Teach me your statutes.

27. Make me to understand the way of your precepts: So I will meditate on your wondrous works.

29. Remove from me the way of falsehood; And grant me your law graciously.

30. I have chosen the way of faithfulness: Your ordinances I have set [before me].

31. I stick to your testimonies: O Yahweh, don't put me to shame.

32. I will run the way of your commandments, When you will enlarge my heart.

33. [HE] Teach me, O Yahweh, the way of your statutes; And I will keep it to the end.

34. Give me understanding, and I will keep your law; Yes, I will observe it with my whole heart.

35. Make me to go in the path of your commandments; For in it I delight.

36. Incline my heart to your testimonies, And not to covetousness.

37. Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity, And quicken me in your ways.

38. Confirm to your slave your word, Which [is in order] to the fear of you.

39. Turn away my reproach of which I am afraid; For your ordinances are good.

40. Look, I have longed after your precepts: Quicken me in your righteousness.

41. [VAV] Let your loving-kindnesses also come to me, O Yahweh, Even your salvation, according to your word.

42. So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me; For I trust in your word.

43. And don't take the word of truth completely out of my mouth; For I have hoped in your ordinances.

44. So I will observe your law continually Forever and ever.

45. And I will walk at liberty; For I have sought your precepts.

46. I will also speak of your testimonies before kings, And will not be put to shame.

47. And I will delight myself in your commandments, Which I have loved.

48. I will lift up my hands also to your commandments, which I have loved; And I will meditate on your statutes.

49. [ZAYIN] Remember the word to your slave, Because you have made me to hope.

50. This is my comfort in my affliction; For your word has quickened me.

51. The proud have had me greatly in derision: [Yet] I have not swerved from your law.

52. I have remembered your ordinances of old, O Yahweh, And have comforted myself.

53. Hot indignation has taken hold on me, Because of the wicked that forsake your law.

54. Your statutes have been my songs In the house of my pilgrimage.

55. I have remembered your name, O Yahweh, in the night, And have observed your law.

56. This I have had, Because I have kept your precepts.

57. [CHET] Yahweh is my portion: I have said that I would observe your words.

58. I entreated your favor with my whole heart: Be merciful to me according to your word.

59. I thought on my ways, And turned my feet to your testimonies.

60. I hurried, and did not delay, To observe your commandments.

61. The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round; [But] I have not forgotten your law.

62. At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you Because of your righteous ordinances.

63. I am a partner of all those who fear you, And of those who observe your precepts.

64. The earth, O Yahweh, is full of your loving-kindness: Teach me your statutes.

65. [TET] You have dealt well with your slave, O Yahweh, according to your word.

67. Before I was afflicted I went astray; But now I observe your word.

68. You are good, and do good; Teach me your statutes.

69. The proud have forged a lie against me: With my whole heart I will keep your precepts.

70. Their heart is as fat as grease; But I delight in your law.

71. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; That I may learn your statutes.

5. Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All those who hate Zion.

6. Let them be as the grass on the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;

4. I will not give sleep to my eyes, Or slumber to my eyelids;

5. Until I find out a place for Yahweh, A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.

6. Look, we heard of it in Ephrathah: We found it in the field of the forest.

7. We will go into his tabernacles; We will worship at his footstool.

8. Arise, O Yahweh, into your resting-place; You, and the ark of your strength.

9. Let your priest be clothed with righteousness; And let your saints shout for joy.

10. For your slave David's sake Don't turn away the face of your anointed.

11. Yahweh has sworn to David in truth; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of your body I will set on your throne.

12. If your sons will keep my covenant And my testimony that I will teach them, Their sons also will sit on your throne forevermore.

14. This is my resting-place forever: Here I will dwell; for I have desired it.

15. I will abundantly bless her provisions: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

16. Her priests also I will clothe with salvation; And her saints will shout aloud for joy.

18. His enemies I will clothe with shame; But on himself will his crown flourish.

## Psalms 133

4. For Yah has chosen Jacob to himself, [And] Israel for his own possession.

5. For I know that Yahweh is great, And that our Lord is above all gods.

6. Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;

7. Who causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who makes lightnings for the rain; Who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries;

8. Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, Both of man and beast;

9. Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, On Pharaoh, and on all his slaves;

10. Who struck many nations, And slew mighty kings,

11. Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan,

12. And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage to Israel his people.

13. Your name, O Yahweh, [endures] forever; Your memorial [name], O Yahweh, throughout all generations.

14. For Yahweh will judge his people, And repent himself concerning his slaves.

15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of man's hands.

16. They have mouths, but they don't speak; They have eyes, but they don't see;

17. They have ears, but they don't hear; Neither is there any breath in their mouths.

18. Those who make them will be like them; Yes, everyone who trusts in them.

19. O house of Israel, bless{+} Yahweh: O house of Aaron, bless{+} Yahweh:

20. O house of Levi, bless{+} Yahweh: You{+} who fear Yahweh, bless{+} Yahweh.

21. Blessed be Yahweh out of Zion, Who stays at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.

2. On the willows in the midst of it We hung up our harps.

3. For there those who led us captive required of us songs, And those who wasted us [required of us] mirth, [saying] Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

4. How shall we sing Yahweh's song In a foreign land?

5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget [her skill].

6. Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, If I don't remember you; If I don't prefer Jerusalem Above my chief joy.

7. Remember, O Yahweh, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to its foundation.

4. For there is not a word in my tongue, But, look, O Yahweh, you know it altogether.

5. You have beset me behind and before, And laid your hand on me.

6. [Such] knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I can't attain to it.

7. Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence?

8. If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: If I make my bed in Sheol, look, you are there.

9. If I take the wings of the morning, And stay in the uttermost parts of the sea;

10. Even there your hand will lead me, And your right hand will hold me.

17. How precious also are your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!

18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: When I awake, I am still with you.

19. Surely you will slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me therefore, you{+} bloodthirsty men.

20. For they speak against you wickedly, And your enemies are lifted up in vain.

21. Don't I hate them, O Yahweh, that hate you? And am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?

22. I hate them with perfect hatred: They have become my enemies.

11. An evil speaker will not be established in the earth: Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

13. Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name: The upright will dwell in your presence.

## Psalms 141

3. Set a watch, O Yahweh, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips.

4. Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, To do deeds of wickedness With men who work iniquity: And don't let me eat of their dainties.

5. Let the righteous strike me [it will be] a kindness; And let him reprove me, [it will be as] oil on the head; Don't let my head refuse it: For continually my prayer is against their evil deeds.

6. Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they will hear my words; for they are sweet.

7. As a millstone broken on the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

8. For my eyes are to you, O Yahweh the Lord: In you I take refuge; don't leave my soul destitute.

9. Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the traps of the workers of iniquity.

10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I nevertheless escape.

## Psalms 142

1. Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer. I cry with my voice to Yahweh; With my voice to Yahweh I plead for mercy.

2. I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble.

3. When my spirit was overwhelmed inside me, You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have hidden a snare for me.

4. Look at [my] right hand, and see; For there is no man who knows me: Refuge has failed me; No man cares for my soul.

5. I cried to you, O Yahweh; I said, You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.

6. Attend to my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.

7. Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks to your name: The righteous will circle me about; For you will deal bountifully with me.

## Psalms 143

1. A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Yahweh; give ear to my supplications: In your faithfulness answer me, [and] in your righteousness.

2. And don't enter into judgment with your slave; For in your sight no man living is righteous.

3. For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has struck my life down to the ground: He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead.

4. Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed inside me; My heart inside me is desolate.

5. I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your doings; I muse on the work of your hands.

6. I spread forth my hands to you: My soul [thirsts] after you, as a weary land. Selah.

7. Hurry to answer me, O Yahweh; my spirit fails: Don't hide your face from me, Lest I become like those who go down into the pit.

8. Cause me to hear your loving-kindness in the morning; For in you I trust: Cause me to know the way in which I should walk; For I lift up my soul to you.

9. Deliver me, O Yahweh, from my enemies: I flee to you to hide me.

10. Teach me to do your will; For you are my God: Your Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness.

11. Quicken me, O Yahweh, for your name's sake: In your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.

12. And in your loving-kindness cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I am your slave.

## Psalms 144

1. [A Psalm] of David. Blessed be Yahweh my rock, Who teaches my hands to war, [And] my fingers to fight:

2. My loving-kindness and my fortress, My high tower and my deliverer; My shield and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdues my people under me.

3. Yahweh, what is man, that you take knowledge of him? Or the son of common man, that you make account of him?

4. Man is like vanity: His days are as a shadow that passes away.

5. Bow your heavens, O Yahweh, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.

6. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out your arrows, and discomfit them.

7. Stretch forth your hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens;

8. Whose mouth speaks deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

9. I will sing a new song to you, O God: On a psaltery of ten strings I will sing praises to you.

10. You are he who gives salvation to kings; Who rescues David his slave from the hurtful sword.

11. Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaks deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

12. That our sons will be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as cornerstones cut after the fashion of a palace;

13. [That] our garners are full, affording all manner of store, [And] our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;

14. [That] our oxen are well laden; [That there is] no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets:

15. Happy is the people who is in such a case; [Yes], happy is the people whose God is Yahweh.
