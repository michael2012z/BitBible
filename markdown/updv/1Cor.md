## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

2. to the church of God which is at Corinth, [even] those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, [the] called saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their [Lord] and ours:

3. Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God always concerning you{+}, for the grace of God which was given you{+} in Christ Jesus;

5. that in everything you{+} were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;

6. even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you{+}:

7. so that you{+} come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;

8. who will also confirm you{+} to the end, [that you{+} are] unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. God is faithful, through whom you{+} were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

10. Now I urge you{+}, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you{+} speak the same thing and [that] there be no divisions among you{+}; but [that] you{+} are completely joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

11. For it has been signified to me concerning you{+}, my brothers, by them [who are of the household] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you{+}.

12. Now this I mean, that each of you{+} says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

13. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you{+}? Or were you{+} baptized into the name of Paul?

14. I thank God that I baptized none of you{+}, except Crispus and Gaius;

15. lest any man should say that you{+} were baptized into my name.

16. And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I don't know whether I baptized any other.

17. For Christ didn't send me to baptize, but to preach the good news: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.

18. For the word of the cross is to those who perish foolishness; but to us who are saved it is the power of God.

19. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And the discernment of the discerning I will bring to nothing.

20. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?

21. For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.

22. Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:

23. but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness;

24. but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

25. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

26. For look at your{+} calling, brothers, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:

27. but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame those who are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;

28. and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, God chose, the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:

29. that no flesh should glory before God.

30. But of him are you{+} in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:

31. that, according to as it is written, He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And I, brothers, when I came to you{+}, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you{+} the testimony of God.

2. For I determined not to know anything among you{+}, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

3. And I was with you{+} in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

4. And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

5. that your{+} faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

6. We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full-grown: yet a wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing:

7. but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, [even] the [wisdom] that has been hidden, which God predetermined before the ages to our glory:

8. which none of the rulers of this age has known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:

9. but as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have they entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love him.

10. But to us God revealed [them] through the Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.

11. For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so the things of God none knows, except the Spirit of God.

12. But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.

13. Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Spirit teaches; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].

14. Now the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he can't know them, because they are spiritually judged.

15. But he who is spiritual judges all things, and he himself is judged of no man.

16. For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And I, brothers, could not speak to you{+} as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to juveniles in Christ.

2. I fed you{+} with milk, not with meat; for you{+} were not yet able [to bear it]: no, not even now are you{+} able;

3. for you{+} are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you{+} jealousy and strife, are you{+} not carnal, and do you{+} not walk after the manner of men?

4. For when one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you{+} not men?

5. What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you{+} believed; and to each as the Lord gave.

6. I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

7. So then neither is he who plants anything, neither he who waters; but God who gives the increase.

8. Now he who plants and he who waters are one: but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.

9. For we are God's coworkers: you{+} are God's husbandry, God's building.

10. According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another builds on it. But let each take heed how he builds on it.

11. For another foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

12. But if any man builds on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;

13. each man's work will be made manifest: for the day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will prove each man's work of what sort it is.

14. If any man's work that he built on it stays, he will receive a reward.

15. If any man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself will be saved; yet so as through fire.

16. Don't you{+} know that you{+} are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you{+}?

17. If any man destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you{+}.

18. Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinks that he is wise among you{+} in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.

19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness:

20. and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are useless.

21. Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours{+};

22. whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours{+};

23. and you{+} are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. Let a man so account of us, as of attendants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

2. Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

3. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you{+}, or of man's judgment: yes, I do not judge my own self.

4. For I know nothing against myself; yet I am not hereby justified: but he who judges me is the Lord.

5. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then each will have his praise from God.

6. Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your{+} sakes; that in us you{+} might learn not [to go] beyond the things which are written; that no one of you{+} is puffed up for the one against the other.

7. For who makes you to differ? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you glory as if you had not received it?

8. Already you{+} are filled, already you{+} have become rich, you{+} have come to reign without us: yes and I would that you{+} did reign, that we also might reign with you{+}.

9. For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.

10. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you{+} are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you{+} are strong; you{+} have glory, but we have dishonor.

11. Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;

12. and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;

13. being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.

14. I do not write these things to shame you{+}, but to admonish you{+} as my beloved children.

15. For though you{+} have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you{+} have] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begot you{+} through the good news.

16. I urge you{+} therefore, be{+} imitators of me.

17. For this cause I have sent to you{+} Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will put you{+} in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ Jesus, even as I teach everywhere in every church.

18. Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you{+}.

19. But I will come to you{+} shortly, if the Lord wills; and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.

20. For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

21. What do you{+} want? Shall I come to you{+} with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. It is actually reported that there is fornication among you{+}, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you{+}] has his father's wife.

2. And you{+} are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he who had participated in this deed might be taken away from among you{+}.

3. For I truly, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him who has so worked this thing,

4. in the name of our Lord Jesus, you{+} being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,

5. to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.

6. Your{+} glorying is not good. Don't you{+} know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?

7. Purge out the old leaven, that you{+} may be a new lump, even as you{+} are unleavened. For our Passover also has been sacrificed, [even] Christ:

8. therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

9. I wrote to you{+} in my letter not to associate with fornicators;

10. not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the greedy and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you{+} must needs go out of the world:

11. but as it is, I wrote to you{+} not to associate with any man who is named a brother if he is a fornicator, or greedy, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; do not even eat with such a one.

12. For what have I to do with judging those who are outside? Do not you{+} judge those who are inside?

13. But those who are outside God will judge. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Dare any of you{+}, having a matter against the other, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?

2. Or don't you{+} know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you{+}, are you{+} unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

3. Don't you{+} know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?

4. If then you{+} have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you{+} set them to judge who are of no account in the church?

5. I say [this] to move you{+} to shame. What, can't there be [found] among you{+} one wise man who will be able to decide between his brothers,

6. but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?

7. Therefore already it is altogether a defect in you{+}, that you{+} have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?

8. No, but you{+} yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your{+}] brothers.

9. Or don't you{+} know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don't be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,

10. nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, will inherit the kingdom of God.

11. And such were some of you{+}: but you{+} were washed, but you{+} were sanctified, but you{+} were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.

12. All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.

13. Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:

14. and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.

15. Don't you{+} know that your{+} bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? God forbid.

16. Or don't you{+} know that he who sticks to the prostitute is one body? For, The two, he says, will become one flesh.

17. But he who sticks to the Lord is one spirit.

18. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body; but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.

19. Or don't you{+} know that your{+} body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you{+}, which you{+} have from God? And you{+} are not your{+} own;

20. for you{+} were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your{+} body.

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Now concerning the things of which you{+} wrote: It is good for a man not to have any sex with a woman.

2. But, because of fornications, let each have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.

3. Let the husband render to the wife her due: and likewise also the wife to the husband.

4. The wife does not have power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband does not have power over his own body, but the wife.

5. Do not deprive{+} one another, except it is by consent for a season, that you{+} may give yourselves to prayer, and may be together again, that Satan does not tempt you{+} because of your{+} lack of self-control.

6. But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.

7. Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Nevertheless each has his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.

8. But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they stay even as I.

9. But if they don't have self-control, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

10. But to the married I give charge, [yes] not I, but the Lord, That the wife is not to depart from her husband,

11. but should she depart, let her stay unmarried, or let her be reconciled to her husband; and that the husband is not to leave his wife.

12. But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she gives her approval to dwell with him, let him not leave her.

13. And if any wife has an unbelieving husband, and he gives his approval to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.

14. For the unbelieving husband has been accepted in the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been accepted in the brother: otherwise your{+} children would be unaccepted; but as it is they are accepted.

15. Yet if the unbelieving departs, let him depart: the brother or the sister has not been bound in such [cases]: but God has called you{+} in peace.

16. For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?

17. Only as the Lord has distributed to each, as God has called each, so let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.

18. Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.

19. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.

20. Let each stay in that calling in which he was called.

21. Were you called being a slave? Do not care for it: no, even if you can become free, use [it] rather.

22. For he who was called in the Lord being a slave, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he who was called being free, is Christ's slave.

23. You{+} were bought with a price; don't become slaves of men.

24. Brothers, let each, [in that calling] in which he was called, stay in this with God.

25. Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.

26. I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is on us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is.

27. Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Don't seek a wife.

28. But should you marry, you haven't sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you{+}.

29. But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened, that from now on both those who have wives may be as though they had none;

30. and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;

31. and those who use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passes away.

32. But I would have you{+} to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:

33. but he who is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,

34. and is divided. [So] also the woman who is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she who is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.

35. And this I say for your{+} own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you{+}, but for that which is seemly, and that you{+} may attend on the Lord without distraction.

36. But if any man thinks that he behaves himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry.

37. But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power as concerning in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], will do well.

38. So then both he who gives his own virgin [daughter] in marriage does well; and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.

39. A wife is bound for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wants; only in the Lord.

40. But she is happier if she stays as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.

2. If any man thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't know yet as he ought to know;

3. but if any man loves God, the same is known by him.

4. Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is [anything] in the world, and that there is no God but one.

5. For though there are those that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are many gods, and many lords;

6. yet to us there is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we to him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.

7. Nevertheless there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as [of] a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.

8. But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.

9. But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours{+} become a stumbling block to the weak.

10. For if a man sees you who has knowledge sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?

11. For through your knowledge he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.

12. And thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you{+} sin against Christ.

13. Therefore, if meat causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh forevermore, that I do not cause my brother to stumble.

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you{+} my work in the Lord?

2. If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you{+}; for the seal of my apostleship are you{+} in the Lord.

3. My defense to those who examine me is this.

4. Do we have no right to eat and to drink?

5. Do we have no right to lead about a wife who is a sister, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Or only I and Barnabas, do we not have a right to forbear working?

7. What soldier ever serves at his own charges? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock, and does not eat of the milk of the flock?

8. Do I speak these things after the manner of men or doesn't the law also say the same?

9. For it is written in the law of Moses, You will not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God cares,

10. or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written: because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes, [to thresh] in hope of partaking.

11. If we sowed to you{+} spiritual things, is it a great matter if we will reap your{+} carnal things?

12. If others partake of [this] right over you{+}, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the good news of Christ.

13. Don't you{+} know that those who work about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple, [and] those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?

14. Even so the Lord directed that those who proclaim the good news should live of the good news.

15. But I have used none of these things: and I do not write these things that it may be so done in my case; for [it was] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.

16. For if I preach the good news, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid on me; for woe is to me, if I do not preach the good news.

17. For if I participate in this of my own will, I have a reward: but if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.

18. What then is my reward? That, when I preach the good news, I may make the good news without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the good news.

19. For though I was free from all [men,] I became a slave to all, that I might gain the more.

20. And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;

21. to those who are without the law, as without the law, not being without the law of God, but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who are without the law.

22. To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.

23. And I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may be a copartner of it.

24. Don't you{+} know that those running in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Even so run; that you{+} may attain.

25. And every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.

26. I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so I fight, not as beating the air:

27. but I buffet my body, and bring it into slavery: lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be disapproved.

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. For I would not, brothers, have you{+} ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;

2. and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

3. and all ate the same spiritual food;

4. and all drank the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.

5. Nevertheless with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

6. Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

7. Neither be{+} idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

8. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and 23,000 fell in one day.

9. Neither let us make trial of Christ, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.

10. Neither murmur{+}, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.

11. Now these things happened to them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the [past] ages have come.

12. Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.

13. No trial has taken you{+} but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not allow you{+} to be tried above what you{+} are able; but will with the trial also make the way of escape, that you{+} may be able to endure it.

14. Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.

15. I speak as to wise men; you{+} judge what I say.

16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?

17. seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.

18. Look at Israel after the flesh: are not those who eat the sacrifices partners with the altar?

19. What do I say then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?

20. But [I say], that the things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I don't want you{+} to be partners with demons.

21. You{+} can't drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: you{+} can't partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?

23. All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.

24. Let no man seek his own, but of another.

25. Whatever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake,

26. for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it.

27. If one of those who do not believe bids you{+} [to a feast], and you{+} are disposed to go; whatever is set before you{+}, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake.

28. But if any man says to you{+}, This has been offered in sacrifice, don't eat, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake:

29. conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?

30. If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

31. Whether therefore you{+} eat, or drink, or whatever you{+} do, do all to the glory of God.

32. Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:

33. even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of the many, that they may be saved.

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be{+} imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.

2. Now I praise you{+} that you{+} remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you{+}.

3. But I would have you{+} know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.

4. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.

5. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.

6. For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.

7. For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, since he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

8. For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:

9. for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:

10. for this cause ought the woman to have [a sign of] authority on her head, because of the angels.

11. Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.

12. For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.

13. Judge{+} in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman prays to God unveiled?

14. Does not even nature itself teach you{+}, that, if a man has long hair, it is a shame to him?

15. But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering.

16. But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

17. But in giving you{+} this charge, I do not praise you{+}, that you{+} come together not for the better but for the worse.

18. For first of all, when you{+} come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you{+}; and I partly believe it.

19. For there must also be factions among you{+}, that those who are approved may also be made manifest among you{+}.

20. When therefore you{+} assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper:

21. for in your{+} eating each takes before [another] his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunk.

22. What, don't you{+} have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you{+} despise the church of God, and put them to shame that do not have? What shall I say to you{+}? Shall I praise you{+}? In this I do not praise you{+}.

23. For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you{+}, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up took bread;

24. and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you{+}: this do in remembrance of me.

25. In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as you{+} drink [it], in remembrance of me.

26. For as often as you{+} eat this bread, and drink the cup, you{+} proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

27. Therefore whoever will eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.

29. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he does not discern the body.

30. For this cause many among you{+} are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.

31. But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.

32. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that we may not be condemned with the world.

33. Therefore, my brothers, when you{+} come together to eat, wait one for another.

34. If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your{+} coming together not be to judgment. And the rest I will set in order whenever I come.

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brothers, I would not have you{+} ignorant.

2. You{+} know that when you{+} were Gentiles [you{+} were] led away to those mute idols, however you{+} might be led.

3. Therefore I make known to you{+}, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God says, Accursed Jesus; and no man can say, Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit.

4. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

5. And there are diversities of servings, and the same Lord.

6. And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.

7. But to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit as well.

8. For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:

9. to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;

10. and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another [diverse] kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:

11. but the one and the same Spirit works all these, dividing to each individually even as he wills.

12. For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.

13. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.

14. For the body is not one member, but many.

15. If the foot will say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.

16. And if the ear will say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.

17. If the whole body is an eye, where is the hearing? If the whole is hearing, where is the smelling?

18. But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.

19. And if there is only one member, where is the body?

20. But now there are many members, but one body.

21. And the eye can't say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you{+}.

22. No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:

23. and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;

24. whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked;

25. that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.

26. And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.

27. Now you{+} are the body of Christ, and severally members of it.

28. And God has set some in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [diverse] kinds of tongues.

29. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all [workers of] miracles?

30. Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?

31. But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way I show to you{+}.

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding bronze, or a clanging cymbal.

2. And if I have [the gift of] prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.

3. And if I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.

4. Love suffers long, it is kind. Love does not envy. Love does not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,

5. does not behave itself unseemly, does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take account of evil;

6. does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;

7. bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

8. Love never fails: but if [there are] prophecies, they will be done away; if [there are] tongues, they will cease; if [there is] knowledge, it will be done away.

9. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;

10. but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part will be done away.

11. When I was a juvenile, I spoke as a juvenile, I felt as a juvenile, I thought as a juvenile: now that I have become a man, I have put away juvenile things.

12. For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I will know fully even as also I was fully known.

13. But now these three stay: faith, hope, and love; and the greatest of these is love.

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual [gifts], yet even better that you{+} may prophesy.

2. For he who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God; for no man understands; but in the spirit he speaks mysteries.

3. But he who prophesies speaks to men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.

4. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but he who prophesies edifies the church.

5. Now I would have all of you{+} speak with tongues, yet even better that you{+} should prophesy: and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks with tongues, except he interprets, that the church may receive edifying.

6. But now, brothers, if I come to you{+} speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you{+}, unless I speak to you{+} either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?

7. Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they don't give a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or harped?

8. For if the trumpet gives an uncertain voice, who will prepare himself for war?

9. So also you{+}, unless you{+} utter by the tongue speech easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you{+} will be speaking into the air.

10. There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no [kind] is without significance.

11. If then I don't know the meaning of the voice, I will be to him who speaks a barbarian, and he who speaks will be a barbarian to me.

12. So also you{+}, since you{+} are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that you{+} may abound to the edifying of the church.

13. Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.

14. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.

15. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.

16. Or else if you bless in the spirit, how will he that fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?

17. For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.

18. I thank God, I speak with tongues more than all of you{+}:

19. nevertheless in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

20. Brothers, don't be children in mind: yet in malice be{+} babes, but in mind be men.

21. In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people; and not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.

22. Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying [is for a sign], not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.

23. If therefore the whole church is assembled together and all speak with tongues, and unlearned or unbelieving men come in, will they not say that you{+} are insane?

24. But if all prophesy, and an unbelieving or unlearned one comes in, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;

25. the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you{+} indeed.

26. What is it then, brothers? When you{+} come together, each has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.

27. If any man speaks in a tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most three, and [that] in turn; and let one interpret:

28. but if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

29. And let the prophets speak [by] two or three, and let the others discern.

30. But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.

31. For you{+} can all prophesy one at a time, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;

32. and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;

33. for God is not [a God] of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,

34. let the women keep silent in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also the law says.

35. And if they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.

36. What? Was it from you{+} that the word of God went forth? Or did it come to you{+} alone?

37. If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write to you{+}, that they are the commandment of the Lord.

38. But if any man ignores [this], he is [to be] ignored.

39. Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.

40. But let all things be done decently and in order.

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. Now I make known to you{+} brothers, the good news which I preached to you{+}, which also you{+} received, in which also you{+} stand,

2. by which also you{+} are saved. For what reason did I preach the good news to you{+}? Unless you{+} hold fast [to it], you{+} believed for nothing.

3. For I delivered to you{+} first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;

4. and that he was buried; and that he has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures;

5. and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;

6. then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part stay until now, but some have fallen asleep;

7. then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;

8. and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.

9. For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than all of them: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

11. Whether then [it is] I or they, so we preach, and so you{+} believed.

12. Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how do some say among you{+} that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13. But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised:

14. and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is also vain, [and] your{+} faith is also vain.

15. Yes, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he did not raise up, if indeed the dead are not raised.

16. For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised:

17. and if Christ has not been raised, your{+} faith [is] useless; you{+} are yet in your{+} sins.

18. Then they also that have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

19. If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.

20. But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.

21. For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.

22. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.

23. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits; then those who are Christ's, at his coming.

24. Then [comes] the end, when he will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.

25. For he must reign, until he has put all his enemies under his feet.

26. The last enemy that will be abolished is death.

27. For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.

28. And when all things have been subjected to him, then will the Son also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.

29. Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?

30. Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?

31. I protest by that glorifying in you{+}, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.

32. If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

33. Don't be deceived: Evil company corrupts good morals.

34. Awake to soberness righteously, and don't sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak [this] to move you{+} to shame.

35. But some one will say, How are the dead raised? And with what manner of body do they come?

36. You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not quickened except it dies:

37. and that which you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other kind;

38. but God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.

39. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.

40. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another.

41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.

42. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

43. it is sown in shame; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:

44. it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body].

45. So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.

46. Nevertheless that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.

47. The first man is of the earth, made of dust: the second man is of heaven.

48. As is the earthly, such are they also who are earthly: and as is the heavenly, such are they also who are heavenly.

49. And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.

50. Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood can't inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.

51. Look, I tell you{+} a mystery: We all will not sleep, but we will all be changed,

52. in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.

53. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

54. But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

55. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?

56. The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:

57. but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. Therefore, my beloved brothers, be{+} steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since you{+} know that your{+} labor is not vain in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so you{+} also do.

2. On the first day of the week let each of you{+} lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.

3. And when I arrive, whomever you{+} will approve, I will send them with letters to carry your{+} bounty to Jerusalem:

4. and if it is meet for me to go also, they will go with me.

5. But I will come to you{+}, when I will have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;

6. but with you{+} it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you{+} may set me forward on my journey wherever I go.

7. For I do not wish to see you{+} now by the way; for I hope to tarry awhile with you{+}, if the Lord permits.

8. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;

9. for a great and effectual door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.

10. Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you{+} without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do:

11. let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me: for I expect him with the brothers.

12. But as concerning Apollos the brother, I implored him much to come to you{+} with the brothers: and it was not all [his] will to come now; but he will come when he will have opportunity.

13. Watch{+}, stand fast{+} in the faith, be{+} manly, be{+} strong.

14. Let all that you{+} do be done in love.

15. Now I urge you{+}, brothers (you{+} know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves in service to the saints),

16. that you{+} also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.

17. And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your{+} part they supplied.

18. For they refreshed my spirit and yours{+}: acknowledge{+} therefore those who are such.

19. The churches of Asia greet you{+}. Aquila and Prisca greet you{+} much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

20. All the brothers greet you{+}. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

21. The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.

22. If any man does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Maranatha.

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you{+}.

24. My love be with all of you{+} in Christ Jesus.
