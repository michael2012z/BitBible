# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:

2. Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I thank my God on all my remembrance of you{+},

4. always in every supplication of mine on behalf of all of you{+} making my supplication with joy,

5. for your{+} fellowship in furtherance of the good news from the first day until now;

6. being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you{+} will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus:

7. even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of all of you{+}, because I have you{+} in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the good news, all of you{+} are copartners with me of grace.

8. For God is my witness, how I long after all of you{+} in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.

9. And this I pray, that your{+} love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;

10. so that you{+} may approve the things that are excellent; that you{+} may be sincere and void of offense to the day of Christ;

11. being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

12. Now I would have you{+} know, brothers, that the things [which happened] to me have fallen out rather to the progress of the good news;

13. so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;

14. and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word without fear.

15. Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will.

16. The ones [that preach] from love know that I am set for the defense of the good news;

17. but, the ones [that] proclaim Christ insincerely from faction, think to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.

18. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.

19. For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your{+} supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

20. according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing will I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.

21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

22. But if to live in the flesh, --[if] this will bring fruit from my work, then what I will choose I don't know.

23. But I am in a strait between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:

24. yet to stay in the flesh is more needful for your{+} sake.

25. And having this confidence, I know that I will stay, yes, and stay with all of you{+}, for your{+} progress and joy in the faith;

26. that your{+} glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you{+} again.

27. Only let your{+} manner of life be worthy of the good news of Christ: that, whether I come and see you{+} or am absent, I may hear of your{+} state, that you{+} stand fast in one spirit, one soul, struggling for the faith of the good news;

28. and in nothing frightened by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your{+} salvation, and that from God;

29. because to you{+} it has been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:

30. having the same conflict which you{+} saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

## Philippians 2

1. If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,

2. make my joy full, that you{+} are of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;

3. [doing] nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting one another better than himself;

4. each of you{+} not looking to his own things, but each of you{+} also to the things of others.

5. Have this mind in you{+}, which was also in Christ Jesus:

6. who, existing in the form of God, did not consider making full use of his equality with God,

7. but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being made in the likeness of men;

8. and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient [even] to death, yes, the death of the cross.

9. Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;

10. that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [those] in heaven and [those] on earth and [those] under the earth,

11. and that every tongue should confess, The Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father.

12. So then, my beloved, even as you{+} have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your{+} own salvation with fear and trembling;

13. for it is God who works in you{+} both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.

14. Do all things without murmurings and questionings:

15. that you{+} may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you{+} are seen as lights in the world,

16. holding forth the word of life; that I may have something of which to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.

17. Yes, and if I am offered on the sacrifice and ministry of your{+} faith, I joy, and rejoice with all of you{+}:

18. and in the same manner do you{+} also joy, and rejoice with me.

19. But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you{+}, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your{+} state.

20. For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your{+} state.

21. For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.

22. But you{+} know the proof of him, that, as a child [to] a father, he served as a slave with me in furtherance of the good news.

23. Therefore I hope to send him forthwith, as soon as I will see how it will go with me:

24. but I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.

25. But I counted it necessary to send to you{+} Epaphroditus, my brother and coworker and fellow-soldier, and your{+} messenger and minister to my need;

26. since he longed after all of you{+}, and was very troubled, because you{+} had heard that he was sick:

27. for indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.

28. I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you{+} see him again, you{+} may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:

30. because for the work of Christ he came near to death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your{+} ministry toward me.

## Philippians 3

1. Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you{+}, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you{+} it is safe.

2. Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:

3. for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:

4. though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:

5. circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as concerning the law, a Pharisee;

6. as concerning zeal, persecuting the church; as concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.

7. Nevertheless what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ.

8. But on the contrary, I also count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and regard them as crap, that I may gain Christ,

9. and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, [even] that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:

10. that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;

11. if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

12. Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if also I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.

13. Brothers, I don't count myself to have laid hold: but one thing [I do], forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,

14. I press on toward the goal to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

15. Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything you{+} are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you{+}:

16. only, to what we have attained, by that same [rule] let us walk.

17. Brothers, be{+} imitators together of me, and observe those who so walk even as you{+} have us for an example.

18. For many walk, of whom I told you{+} often, and now tell you{+} even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:

19. whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and [whose] glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.

20. For our citizenship is in heaven; from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:

21. who will fashion anew the body of our humiliation, [that it may be] conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.

## Philippians 4

1. Therefore, my brothers beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.

2. I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.

3. Yes, I urge you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they struggled with me in the good news, with Clement also, and the rest of my coworkers, whose names are in the Book of Life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.

5. Let your{+} forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.

6. In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your{+} requests be made known to God.

7. And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your{+} hearts and your{+} thoughts in Christ Jesus.

8. Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think on these things.

9. The things which you{+} both learned and received and heard and saw in me, participate in these things: and the God of peace will be with you{+}.

10. But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you{+} have revived your{+} thought for me; in which you{+} did indeed take thought, but you{+} lacked opportunity.

11. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content in it.

12. I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.

13. I can do all things in him who strengthens me.

14. Nevertheless you{+} did well that you{+} had fellowship with my affliction.

15. And you{+} yourselves also know, you{+} Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you{+} only;

16. for even in Thessalonica you{+} sent once and again to my need.

17. Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increases to your{+} account.

18. But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things [that came] from you{+}, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

19. And my God will supply every need of yours{+} according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

20. Now to our God and Father [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.

21. Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you{+}.

22. All the saints greet you{+}, especially those who are of Caesar's household.

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your{+} spirit.
