# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul, a slave of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,

2. in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before eternal times;

3. but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;

4. to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

5. For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave you charge;

6. if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.

7. For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of monetary gain;

8. but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;

9. holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.

10. For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,

11. whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for greed of monetary gain's sake.

12. One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.

13. This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,

14. not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

15. To the pure all things are pure: but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.

16. They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being disgusting, and disobedient, and to every good work disapproved.

## Titus 2

1. But you speak the things which befit the sound doctrine:

2. that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:

3. that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;

4. that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,

5. [to be] sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God not be blasphemed:

6. the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:

7. in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your doctrine [showing] uncorruptness, gravity,

8. sound speech, that can't be condemned; that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.

9. [Exhort] slaves to be in subjection to their own masters, [and] to be well-pleasing [to them] in all things; not opposing;

10. not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.

11. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,

12. instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present age;

13. looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of Jesus Christ, our great God and Savior;

14. who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.

15. These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.

## Titus 3

1. Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to every good work,

2. to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.

3. For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves to diverse desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.

4. But when the kindness of God our Savior, and his love toward man, appeared,

5. not by works [done] in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,

6. which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;

7. that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men:

9. but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and useless.

10. A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;

11. knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.

12. When I will send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.

13. Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing is wanting to them.

14. And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they not be unfruitful.

15. All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with all of you{+}.
