## Song of Songs 1

1. The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.

2. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For your love is better than wine.

3. Your oils have a goodly fragrance; Your name is oil poured forth; Therefore the young women love you.

4. Draw me; we will run after you: The king has brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in you; We will make mention of your love more than of wine: Rightly they love you.

5. I am black, but comely, Oh you{+} daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.

6. Don't look on me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; [But] my own vineyard I have not kept.

7. Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where you shepherd [your flock], Where you make [it] to rest at noon: For why should I be as one who is veiled Beside the flocks of your fellow shepherds?

8. If you don't know, O you most beautiful among women, Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And shepherd your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.

9. I have compared you, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.

10. Your cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], Your neck with strings of jewels.

11. We will make you plaits of gold With studs of silver.

12. While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.

13. My beloved is to me [as] a bundle of myrrh, That lies between my breasts.

14. My beloved is to me a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi.

15. Look, you are beautiful, my love; Look you are beautiful; Your eyes are doves.

16. Look, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant: Also our couch is green.

17. The beams of our house are cedars, [And] our rafters are firs.

## Song of Songs 2

1. I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.

2. As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.

3. As the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.

4. He brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me was love.

5. Stregthen{+} me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am sick from love.

6. His left hand [is] under my head, And his right hand embraces me.

7. I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you{+} do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.

8. The voice of my beloved! Look, he comes, Leaping on the mountains, Skipping on the hills.

9. My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: Look, he stands behind our wall; He looks in at the windows; He glances through the lattice.

10. My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.

11. For, look, the winter is past; The rain is over and gone;

12. The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing [of birds] has come, And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land;

13. The fig-tree ripens her green figs, And the vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.

14. O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the steep place, Let me see your countenance, Let me hear your voice; For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.

15. Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, That spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.

16. My beloved is mine, and I am his: He shepherds [his flock] among the lilies.

17. Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart On the mountains of Bether.

## Song of Songs 3

1. By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I did not find him.

2. [I said], I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I did not find him.

3. The watchmen who go about the city found me; [To whom I said], Did you{+} see him whom my soul loves?

4. It was but a little while that I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mother's house, And into the chamber of her who became pregnant with me.

5. I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you{+} do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.

6. Who is this that comes up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant?

7. Look, it is the litter of Solomon; Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty men of Israel.

8. All of them handle the sword, [and] are expert in war: Every man has his sword on his thigh, Because of fear in the night.

9. King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon.

10. He made its pillars of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, The midst of it being paved with love, From the daughters of Jerusalem.

11. Go forth, O you{+} daughters of Zion, and look at King Solomon, With the crown with which his mother has crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.

5. Your two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.

6. Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get myself to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.

7. You are entirely beautiful, my love; And there is no spot in you.

9. You have ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride; You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, With one chain of your neck.

10. How fair is your love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is your love than wine! And the fragrance of your oils than all manner of spices!

11. Your lips, O [my] bride, drop [as] the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under your tongue; And the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.

12. A garden shut up is my sister, [my] bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

13. Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,

14. Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.

15. [You are] a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.

## Song of Songs 5

1. I have come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drank my wine with my milk. Eat, O companions; Drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.

2. I was asleep, but my heart awoke: It is the voice of my beloved that knocks, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.

3. I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

5. I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.

12. Before I was aware, my soul set me [Among] the chariots of my princely people.

3. Your two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe.

4. Your neck is like the tower of ivory; Your eyes [as] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looks toward Damascus.

10. I am my beloved's; And his desire is toward me.

11. Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.

4. I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, That you{+} do not stir up, nor awake [my] love, Until he pleases.

6. Set me as a seal on your heart, As a seal on your arm: For love is as strong as death; Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; The flashes of it are flashes of fire, An intense flame of Yahweh.

7. Many waters can't quench love, Neither can floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, He would be completely despised.

8. We have a little sister, And she has no breasts: What shall we do for our sister In the day when she will be spoken for?

9. If she is a wall, We will build on her a turret of silver: And if she is a door, We will enclose her with boards of cedar.

10. I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers [of it]: Then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.

11. Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Every one for its fruit was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.

12. My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: You, O Solomon, will have the thousand, And those who keep its fruit two hundred.

13. You who dwell in the gardens, My fellow shepherds listen for your voice: Cause me to hear it.

14. Hurry, my beloved, And be like a roe or to a young hart On the mountains of spices.
