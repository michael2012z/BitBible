# Galatians

## Galatians 1

1. Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),

2. and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:

3. Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,

4. who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father:

5. to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.

6. I marvel that you{+} are so quickly removing from him who called you{+} in the grace of Christ to different good news,

7. which is not other [good news], only there are some that trouble you{+}, and would pervert the good news of Christ.

8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you{+} good news other than that which we preached to you{+}, let him be accursed.

9. As we have said before, so I say now again, if any man preaches to you{+} good news other than that which you{+} received, let him be accursed.

10. For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a slave of Christ.

11. For I make known to you{+}, brothers, as concerning the good news which was preached by me, that it is not after man.

12. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ.

13. For you{+} have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:

14. and I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

15. But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,

16. to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach [the good news of] him among the Gentiles; right away I did not confer with flesh and blood:

17. neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.

18. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.

19. But I saw none of the other apostles, except James the Lord's brother.

20. Now concerning the things which I write to you{+}, look, before God, I don't lie.

21. Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

22. And I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ:

23. but they only heard it said, He who once persecuted us now preaches [the good news of] the faith of which he once made havoc;

24. and they glorified God in me.

## Galatians 2

1. Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.

2. And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the good news which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.

3. But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:

4. and that because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery:

5. to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might continue with you{+}.

6. But from those who were reputed to be somewhat--whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God does not accept man's person--they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:

7. but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with [the good news] of the circumcision

8. (for he who worked for Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision worked for me also to the Gentiles);

9. and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;

10. only [they wanted] that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.

11. But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.

12. For before some came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.

13. And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.

14. But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas before [them] all, If you, being a Jew, live as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how do you compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

15. We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

16. yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh be justified.

17. But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? God forbid.

18. For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.

19. For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ;

20. and it is no longer I who live, but Christ living in me: and that [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, [the faith] which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself up for me.

21. I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing.

## Galatians 3

1. O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you{+}, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?

2. This only I would learn from you{+}. Did you{+} receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

3. Are you{+} so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you{+} now perfected in the flesh?

4. Did you{+} suffer so many things for nothing? If it is indeed for nothing.

5. He therefore that supplies to you{+} the Spirit, and works miracles among you{+}, [does he do it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.

7. Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.

8. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the good news beforehand to Abraham, [saying,] In you will all the nations be blessed.

9. So then those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.

10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.

11. Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous will live by faith;

12. and the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will live in them.

13. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree:

14. that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

15. Brothers, I speak after the manner of men: Though it is but a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds thereto.

16. Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.

17. Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect.

18. For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.

19. What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made; [and it was] directed through angels by the hand of a mediator.

20. Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one; but God is one.

21. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could bring life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.

22. But the Scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

23. But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterward be revealed.

24. So that the law has become our tutor [to bring us] to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

25. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.

26. For you{+} are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.

27. For as many of you{+} as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.

28. There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither slave nor free, there can be no male and female; for you{+} are all one in Christ Jesus.

29. And if you{+} are Christ's, then are you{+} Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.

## Galatians 4

1. But I say that so long as the heir is a juvenile, he differs nothing from a slave though he is lord of all;

2. but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.

3. So we also, when we were juveniles, were being made slaves under the rudiments of the world:

4. but when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

5. that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

6. And because you{+} are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

7. So that you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.

8. Nevertheless at that time, not knowing God, you{+} served as slaves to those that by nature are no gods:

9. but now that you{+} have come to know God, and what's more, to be known by God, how do you{+} turn back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, to which you{+} desire to serve as slaves over again?

10. You{+} observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.

11. I am afraid of you{+}, lest by any means I have bestowed labor on you{+} for nothing.

12. I urge you{+}, brothers, become as I [am], for I also [have become] as you{+} [are]. You{+} did me no wrong:

13. but you{+} know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the good news to you{+} the first time:

14. and that which was a trial to you{+} in my flesh you{+} did not despise, nor reject; but you{+} received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.

15. Where then is that blessedness of yours? For I bear you{+} witness, that, if possible, you{+} would have plucked out your{+} eyes and given them to me.

16. So then have I become your{+} enemy, by telling you{+} the truth?

17. They zealously seek you{+} in no good way; no, they desire to shut you{+} out, that you{+} may seek them.

18. But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you{+}.

19. My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you{+}--

20. but I could wish to be present with you{+} now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you{+}.

21. Tell me, you{+} who desire to be under the law, don't you{+} hear the law?

22. For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman, and one by the free woman.

23. Nevertheless the [son] by the slave woman is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the free woman [is born] through promise.

24. Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children to slavery, which is Hagar.

25. Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answers to the Jerusalem that now is: for she works as a slave along with her children.

26. But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.

27. For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that do not bear; Break forth and cry, you who do not travail: For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the husband.

28. Now you{+}, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.

29. But as then he who was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, so also it is now.

30. Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son: for the son of the slave woman will not inherit with the son of the free woman.

31. Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.

## Galatians 5

1. For freedom Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and don't be entangled again in a yoke of slavery.

2. Look, I Paul say to you{+}, that, if you{+} receive circumcision, Christ will profit you{+} nothing.

3. Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

4. You{+} are severed from Christ, you{+} who would be justified by the law; you{+} have fallen away from grace.

5. For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.

6. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.

7. You{+} were running well; who hindered you{+} that you{+} should not obey the truth?

8. This persuasion [is] not from him who calls you{+}.

9. A little leaven leavens the whole lump.

10. I have confidence toward you{+} in the Lord, that you{+} will be none otherwise minded: but he who troubles you{+} will bear his judgment, whoever he is.

11. But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been done away.

12. I would that those who unsettle you{+} would even go beyond circumcision.

13. For you{+}, brothers, were called for freedom; only [do] not [use] your{+} freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve as slaves to one another.

14. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this: You will love your fellow man as yourself.

15. But if you{+} bite and devour one another, take heed that you{+} are not consumed one of another.

16. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you{+} will not fulfill the desire of the flesh.

17. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that you{+} may not do the things that you{+} want.

18. But if you{+} are led by the Spirit, you{+} are not under the law.

19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]: fornication, impurity, sexual immorality,

20. idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,

21. envyings, drunkenness, revelings, and things similar to these; of which I forewarn you{+}, even as I did forewarn you{+}, that those who participate in such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

23. meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.

24. And those who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

25. If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.

26. Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.

## Galatians 6

1. Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you{+} who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself, lest you also be tempted.

2. Bear{+} one another's burdens, and so you{+} will fulfill the law of Christ.

3. For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

4. But let each prove his own work, and then he will have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not in another.

5. For each will bear his own load.

6. But let him who is taught the word share with him who teaches in all good things.

7. Don't be deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.

8. For he who sows to his own flesh will of the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.

9. And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we will reap, if we do not faint.

10. So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.

11. See with how large letters I write to you{+} with my own hand.

12. As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you{+} to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.

13. For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you{+} circumcised, that they may glory in your{+} flesh.

14. But far be it from me to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

15. For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.

16. And as many as will walk by this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.

17. From now on, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your{+} spirit, brothers. Amen.
