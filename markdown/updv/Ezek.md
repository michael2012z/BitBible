# Ezekiel

## Ezekiel 1

1. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

2. In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,

3. the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Yahweh was there on him.

4. And I looked and saw that a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.

5. And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of man.

6. And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.

7. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.

8. And they had the hands of man under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them had their faces and their wings [thus]:

9. their wings were joined one to another; they did not turn when they went; they went every one straight forward.

10. As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of man; and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side; and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side; the four of them had also the face of an eagle.

11. And their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

12. And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they did not turn when they went.

13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

14. And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.

15. And I looked at the living creatures, and saw one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of their four faces.

16. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and the four of them had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel inside a wheel.

17. When they went, they went in their four directions: they did not turn when they went.

18. As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes round about.

19. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20. Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

21. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

22. And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the awesome crystal to look at, stretched forth over their heads above.

23. And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.

24. And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.

25. And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.

26. And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of man on it above.

27. And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire inside it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.

28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one who spoke.

## Ezekiel 2

1. And he said to me, Son of Man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.

2. And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.

3. And he said to me, Son of Man, I send you to the sons of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.

4. And the sons are impudent and stiffhearted: I am sending you to them; and you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh.

5. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet will know that there has been a prophet among them.

6. And you, Son of Man, don't be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions: don't be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

7. And you will speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are in rebellion.

8. But you, Son of Man, hear what I say to you; don't be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.

9. And I looked and saw that a hand was put forth to me; and saw that a roll of a book was in it;

10. And he spread it before me: and it was written inside and outside; and there were written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

## Ezekiel 3

1. And he said to me, Son of Man, eat that which you find; eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.

2. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.

3. And he said to me, Son of Man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your insides with this roll that I give you. Then I ate it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

4. And he said to me, Son of Man, go, get to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.

5. For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;

6. not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can't understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.

7. But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.

8. Look, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.

9. As an adamant harder than flint I have made your forehead: don't fear them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

10. Moreover he said to me, Son of Man, all my words that I will speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.

11. And go, get to them of the captivity, to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

12. Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place.

13. And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.

14. So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me.

15. Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and there where they were dwelling; and I sat there dismayed among them seven days.

16. And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

17. Son of Man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

18. When I say to the wicked, You will surely die; and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man will die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.

19. Yet if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

20. Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die: because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.

21. Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.

22. And the hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.

23. Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, look, the glory of Yahweh stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.

24. Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house.

25. But you, Son of Man, look, they will lay bands on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them:

26. and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.

27. But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. You also, Son of Man, take for yourself a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem:

2. and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.

3. And you take to yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it, and it will be besieged, and you will lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.

4. Moreover you lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according to] the number of the days that you will lie on it, you will bear their iniquity.

5. For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

6. And again, when you have accomplished these, you will lie on your right side, and will bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, I have appointed it to you.

7. And you will set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you will prophesy against it.

8. And, look, I lay bands on you, and you will not turn from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.

9. You take also to yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make yourself bread of them; [according to] the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred and ninety days, you will eat of it.

10. And your food which you will eat will be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time you will eat it.

11. And you will drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time you will drink.

12. And you will eat it as barley cakes, and you will bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.

13. And Yahweh said, Even thus will the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.

14. Then I said, Ah Sovereign Yahweh! Look, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither has there come contaminated flesh into my mouth.

15. Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you will prepare your bread on it.

16. Moreover he said to me, Son of Man, look, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they will drink water by measure, and in dismay:

17. that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed a man and his brother, and pine away in their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And you, Son of Man, take yourself a sharp sword; [as] a barber's razor you will take it to yourself, and will cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take yourself balances to weigh, and divide the hair.

2. A third part you will burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you will take a third part, and strike with the sword round about it; and a third part you will scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.

3. And you will take of them a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.

4. And of these again you will take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom will a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.

5. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.

6. And she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they haven't walked in them.

7. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you{+}, and haven't walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you{+};

8. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.

9. And I will do in you that which I haven't done, and to which I will not do anymore the like, because of all your disgusting behaviors.

10. Therefore the fathers will eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons will eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you; and the whole remnant of you I will scatter to all the winds.

11. Therefore, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your disgusting behaviors, therefore I also will shave [you off]; neither will my eye spare, and I also will have no pity.

12. A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and with famine they will be consumed in the midst of you; and a third part will fall by the sword round about you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.

13. Thus will my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted; and they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.

14. Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all who pass by.

15. So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about you, when I will execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Yahweh, have spoken it;)

16. when I will send on them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you{+}: and I will increase the famine on you{+}, and will break your{+} staff of bread;

17. and I will send on you{+} famine and evil beasts, and they will bereave you; and pestilence and blood will pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 6

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,

3. and say, You{+} mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Yahweh: Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Look, I, even I, will bring a sword on you{+}, and I will destroy your{+} high places.

4. And your{+} altars will become desolate, and your{+} sun-images will be broken; and I will cast down your{+} slain men before your{+} idols.

5. And I will lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your{+} bones round about your{+} altars.

6. In all your{+} dwelling-places the cities will be laid waste, and the high places will be desolate; that your{+} altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your{+} idols may be broken and cease, and your{+} sun-images may be cut down, and your{+} works may be abolished.

7. And the slain will fall in the midst of you{+}, and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

8. Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you{+} will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you{+} will be scattered through the countries.

9. And those of you{+} who escape will remember me among the nations where they will be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which prostitute after their idols: and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their disgusting behaviors.

10. And they will know that I am Yahweh: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.

11. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas! Because of all the evil disgusting behaviors of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

12. He who is far off will die of the pestilence; and he who is near will fall by the sword; and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine: thus I will accomplish my wrath on them.

13. And you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men will be among their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.

14. And I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness of Diblatha, in all their habitations: and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 7

1. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. And you, Son of Man, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to the land of Israel, An end: the end has come upon the four corners of the land.

3. Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your disgusting behaviors.

4. And my eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your disgusting behaviors will be in the midst of you: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

5. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: An evil, an only evil; look, it comes.

6. An end has come, the end has come; it awakes against you; look, it comes.

7. Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land: the time has come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, on the mountains.

8. Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your disgusting behaviors.

9. And my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring on you according to your ways; and your disgusting behaviors will be in the midst of you; and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, do strike.

10. Look, the day, see it comes: your doom has gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.

11. Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [will remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither will there be eminency among them.

12. The time has come, the day draws near: don't let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all their multitude.

13. For the seller will not return to that which is sold, although they are yet alive: for the vision is concerning their whole multitude, none will return; neither will any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

14. They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all their multitude.

15. The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside: he who is in the field will die with the sword: and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.

16. But the ones of those who escape will escape, and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity.

17. All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.

18. They will also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them; and shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.

19. They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Yahweh: they will not satisfy their souls, neither fill their insides; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.

20. As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their disgusting things [and] their detestable things in it: therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.

21. And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they will profane it.

22. I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret [place]; and robbers will enter into it, and profane it.

23. Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

24. Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places will be profaned.

25. Destruction comes; and they will seek peace, and there will be none.

26. Mischief will come upon mischief, and rumor will be on rumor; and they will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

27. The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts I will judge them; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 8

1. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Sovereign Yahweh fell there on me.

2. Then I looked and saw a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.

3. And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks toward the north; where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.

4. And, look, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.

5. Then he said to me, Son of Man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and look, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.

6. And he said to me, Son of Man, do you see what they do? Even the great disgusting things that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great disgusting things.

7. And he brought me to the door of the court; and I looked and saw a hole in the wall.

8. Then he said to me, Son of Man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, look, a door.

9. And he said to me, Go in, and see the wicked disgusting things that they do here.

10. So I went in and saw; and look, every form of creeping things, and detestable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the wall round about.

11. And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.

12. Then he said to me, Son of Man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? For they say, Yahweh does not see us; Yahweh has forsaken the land.

13. He also said to me, You will again see yet other great disgusting things which they do.

14. Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh's house which was toward the north; and look, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.

15. Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], O Son of Man? You will again see yet greater disgusting things than these.

16. And he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh's house; and look, at the door of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Yahweh, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.

17. Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], O Son of Man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, look, they put the branch to their nose.

18. Therefore I will also deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause{+} those who have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

2. And look, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.

3. And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, on which it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side.

4. And Yahweh said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and that cry over all the disgusting things that are done in the midst of it.

5. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go{+} through the city after him, and strike: don't let your{+} eye spare, neither have{+} pity;

6. slay completely the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but don't come near any man on whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men who were before the house.

7. And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go{+} forth. And they went forth, and struck in the city.

8. And it came to pass, while they were striking, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Sovereign Yahweh! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?

9. Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting [of judgment]: for they say, Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh does not see.

10. And as for me also, my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.

11. And look, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. Then I looked, and saw that in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

2. And he spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.

3. Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

4. And the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh's glory.

5. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.

6. And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.

7. And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [of it], and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.

8. And there appeared in the cherubim the form of man's hand under their wings.

9. And I looked, and saw, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.

10. And as for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, as if a wheel had been inside a wheel.

11. When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they didn't turn as they went.

12. And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that the four of them had.

13. As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling [wheels].

14. And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

15. And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.

16. And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them.

17. When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

18. And the glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.

19. And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

20. This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.

21. Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of man was under their wings.

22. And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.

## Ezekiel 11

1. Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Yahweh's house, which looks eastward: and look, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

2. And he said to me, Son of Man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;

3. who say, [The time] is not near to build houses: this [city] is the cauldron, and we are the flesh.

4. Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O Son of Man.

5. And the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, Speak, Thus says Yahweh: Thus you{+} have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your{+} mind.

6. You{+} have multiplied your{+} slain in this city, and you{+} have filled its streets with the slain.

7. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Your{+} slain whom you{+} have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the cauldron; but you{+} will be brought forth out of the midst of it.

8. You{+} have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you{+}, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

9. And I will bring you{+} forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you{+} into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you{+}.

10. You{+} will fall by the sword; I will judge you{+} in the border of Israel; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

11. This [city] will not be your{+} cauldron, neither will you{+} be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you{+} in the border of Israel;

12. and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh: for you{+} have not walked in my statutes, neither have you{+} executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you{+}.

13. And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Sovereign Yahweh! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

14. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

15. Son of Man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are they] to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get{+} far from Yahweh; to us this land is given for a possession.

16. Therefore say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.

17. Therefore say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will gather you{+} from the peoples, and assemble you{+} out of the countries where you{+} have been scattered, and I will give you{+} the land of Israel.

18. And they will come there, and they will take away all its detestable and disgusting things from there.

19. And I will give them another heart, and I will put a new spirit inside you{+}; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;

20. that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they will be my people, and I will be their God.

21. But those whose heart walks after their detestable things and disgusting things, I will bring their way on their own heads, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

22. Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

23. And the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

24. And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

25. Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that Yahweh had shown me.

## Ezekiel 12

1. The word of Yahweh also came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, you dwell in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and don't see, that have ears to hear, and don't hear; for they are a rebellious house.

3. Therefore, you Son of Man, prepare for yourself stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and you will remove from your place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.

4. And you will bring forth your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and you will go forth yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.

5. Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry out through it.

6. In their sight you will bear it on your shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; you will cover your face, that you don't see the land: for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.

7. And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight.

8. And in the morning the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

9. Son of Man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?

10. Say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: This burden [concerns] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.

11. Say, I am your{+} sign: like I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.

12. And the prince who is among them will bear on his shoulder in the dark, and will go forth: they will dig through the wall to carry out through it: he will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes.

13. My net also I will spread on him, and he will be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there.

14. And I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.

15. And they will know that I am Yahweh, when I will disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.

16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their disgusting behaviors among the nations where they come; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

17. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

18. Son of Man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness;

19. and say to the people of the land, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate of all that is in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.

20. And the cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

21. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

22. Son of Man, what is this proverb that you{+} have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?

23. Tell them therefore, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.

24. For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering psychic readings inside the house of Israel.

25. For I am Yahweh; I will speak, and the word that I will speak will be performed; it will be deferred no more: for in your{+} days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

26. Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

27. Son of Man, look, those of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.

28. Therefore say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: None of my words will be deferred anymore, but the word which I will speak will be performed, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear{+} the word of Yahweh:

3. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

4. O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.

5. You{+} have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh.

6. They have seen falsehood and a lying psychic reading, that say, Yahweh says; but Yahweh has not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.

7. Have you{+} not seen a false vision, and have you{+} not spoken a lying psychic reading, in that you{+} say, Yahweh says; albeit I haven't spoken?

8. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, look, I am against you{+}, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

9. And my hand will be against the prophets that see false visions, and that tell lying fortunes: they will not be in the council of my people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the land of Israel; and you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.

10. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one builds up a wall, look, they daub it with untempered [mortar]:

11. say to those who daub it with untempered [mortar], that it will fall: there will be an overflowing shower; and you{+}, O great hailstones, will fall; and a stormy wind will rend it.

12. Look, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you{+}, Where is the daubing with which you{+} have daubed it?

13. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.

14. So I will break down the wall that you{+} have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; and it will fall, and you{+} will be consumed in the midst of it: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

15. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have daubed it with untempered [mortar]; and I will say to you{+}, The wall is no more, neither those who daubed it;

16. [to wit], the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

17. And you, Son of Man, set your face against the daughters of your people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them,

18. and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of [persons of] every stature to hunt souls! Will you{+} hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?

19. And you{+} have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your{+} lying to my people who listen to lies.

20. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against your{+} pillows, with which you{+} there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your{+} arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls who you{+} hunt to make [them] fly.

21. Your{+} kerchiefs also I will tear, and deliver my people out of your{+} hand, and they will be no more in your{+} hand to be hunted; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

22. Because with lies you{+} have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:

23. Therefore you{+} will no more see false visions, nor tell any fortunes: and I will deliver my people out of your{+} hand; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 14

1. Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me.

2. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

3. Son of Man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?

4. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Every man of the house of Israel that takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I Yahweh will answer him in it according to the multitude of his idols;

5. that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

6. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Return{+}, and turn yourselves from your{+} idols; and turn away your{+} faces from all your{+} disgusting things.

7. For every man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself:

8. and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

9. And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Yahweh, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

10. And they will bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks [him];

11. that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

12. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

13. Son of Man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and beast;

14. though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

15. If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it is made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;

16. though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.

17. Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;

18. though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.

19. Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;

20. though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

21. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: How much more when I send my four intense judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!

22. Yet, look, in it will be left a remnant that will be carried forth, both sons and daughters: look, they will come forth to you{+}, and you{+} will see their way and their doings; and you{+} will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.

23. And they will comfort you{+}, when you{+} see their way and their doings; and you{+} will know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?

3. Will wood be taken of it to make any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it?

4. Look, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?

5. Look, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, will it yet be meet for any work!

6. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

7. And I will set my face against them; they will go forth from the fire, but the fire will devour them; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.

8. And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 16

1. Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, cause Jerusalem to know her disgusting behaviors;

3. and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to Jerusalem: Your birth and your nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was your father, and your mother was a Hittite.

4. And as for your nativity, in the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut, neither were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

5. No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, for that your person was abhorred, in the day that you were born.

6. And when I passed by you, and saw you weltering in your blood, I said to you in your blood, live; yes, I said to you in your blood, live.

7. I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and waxed great, and you attained to excellent ornament; your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown; yet you were naked and bare.

8. Now when I passed by you, and looked on you, and saw your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you, says the Sovereign Yahweh, and you became mine.

9. Then I washed you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.

10. I clothed you also with embroidered work, and put sandals on you with sealskin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and covered you with silk.

11. And I decked you with ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands, and a chain on your neck.

12. And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.

13. Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work; you ate fine flour, and honey, and oil; and you were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate.

14. And your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

15. But you trusted in your beauty, and prostituted because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by, that it may be for him.

16. And you took of your garments, and made for yourself high places decked with diverse colors, and prostituted on them: [this] should not come, neither should it be [so].

17. You also took your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given to you, and made for yourself images of men, and prostituted with them;

18. and you took your embroidered garments, and covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.

19. My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a sweet savor; and [thus] it was, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

20. Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these you have sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your prostitutions a small matter,

21. that you have slain my sons, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through [the fire] to them?

22. And in all your disgusting behaviors and your prostitutions you haven't remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were weltering in your blood.

23. And it has come to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe to you! says the Sovereign Yahweh,)

24. that you have built yourself a vaulted place, and have made yourself a lofty place in every street.

25. You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and were disgusted with your beauty, and have spread your legs for everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.

26. You have also prostituted with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger.

27. Look therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your ordinary [food], and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.

28. You have prostituted also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have prostituted with them, and yet you were not satisfied.

29. You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of traffic, to Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied herewith.

30. How weak is your heart, says the Sovereign Yahweh, seeing you do all these things, the work of an overbearing prostitute;

31. in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn wages.

32. A wife who commits adultery! Who takes strangers instead of her husband!

33. They give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.

34. And you are different from [other] women in your prostitution, in that no one solicits you for prostitution; and you pay but you are not paid, therefore you are different.

35. Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of Yahweh:

36. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your disgusting things, and for the blood of your sons, that you gave to them;

37. therefore look, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, with all those who you have hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.

38. And I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.

39. I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and they will strip you of your clothes, and take your fair jewels; and they will leave you naked and bare.

40. They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.

41. And they will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you to cease prostituting, and you will also give no hire anymore.

42. So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be angry no more.

43. Because you haven't remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, look, I also will bring your way on your head, says the Sovereign Yahweh: and you will not commit this lewdness with all your disgusting behaviors.

44. Look, everyone who uses proverbs will use [this] proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

45. You are the daughter of your mother, that loathes her husband and her sons; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their sons: your{+} mother was a Hittite, and your{+} father an Amorite.

46. And your elder sister is Samaria, that dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

47. Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor followed their disgusting behaviors; but, as [if that were] a very little [thing], you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.

48. As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, Sodom your sister did not do, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.

49. Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

50. And then they were lifted up, and then did disgusting things before me: therefore I took them away as I saw [this].

51. Neither did Samaria commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your disgusting behaviors more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the disgusting things that you have done.

52. You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins you are more disgusting than they, they are more righteous than you: yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.

53. And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives in the midst of them;

54. that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.

55. And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your{+} former estate.

56. For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,

57. before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite to you round about.

58. You have borne your lewdness and your disgusting behaviors, says Yahweh.

59. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

60. Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.

61. Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you will receive your sisters, your elder [sisters] and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.

62. And I will establish my covenant with you; and you will know that I am Yahweh;

63. that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth anymore, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 17

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;

3. and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had diverse colors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:

4. he cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.

5. He also took of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.

6. And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.

7. There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, look, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the rows of its plantation, that he might water it.

8. It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.

9. Say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Will it prosper? Will he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? And not by a strong arm or many people can it be raised from its roots.

10. Yes, look, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not completely wither, when the east wind touches it? It will wither on the rows where it grew.

11. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

12. Say now to the rebellious house, Don't you{+} know what these things mean? Tell them, Look, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to himself to Babylon:

13. and he took of the royal seed, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;

14. that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.

15. But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he escape that does such things? Will he break the covenant, and yet escape?

16. As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he will die.

17. Neither will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.

18. For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and look, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things; he will not escape.

19. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it on his own head.

20. And I will spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.

21. And all his places of refuge with all his bands will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered toward every wind: and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.

22. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain:

23. in the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it will stay all birds of every wing; in the shade of its branches they will stay.

24. And all the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.

## Ezekiel 18

1. The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,

2. What do you{+} mean, that you{+} use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge?

3. As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, you{+} will not have [occasion] anymore to use this proverb in Israel.

4. Look, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins will die.

5. But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,

6. and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his fellow man's wife, neither has come near to a woman in her impurity,

7. and has not wronged any, but has restored his pledge for debt, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;

8. he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,

9. has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to act in accordance with them; he is just, he will surely live, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

10. If he begets a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, and is one who does this type of thing;

11. and not only does this type of thing, but also has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his fellow man's wife,

12. has wronged the poor and needy, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has done a disgusting thing,

13. has given forth on interest, and has taken increase; will he then live? He will not live: he has done all these disgusting things; he will surely die; his blood will be on him.

14. Now, look, if he begets a son, that sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and he sees, and does not do such;

15. that has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his fellow man's wife,

16. neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge, neither has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;

17. that has withdrawn his hand from the poor, that has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he will not die for the iniquity of his father, he will surely live.

18. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, look, he will die in his iniquity.

19. Yet you{+} say, Why doesn't the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live.

20. The soul who sins will die: the son will not bear the iniquity of the father, neither will the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous will be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be on him.

21. But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die.

22. None of his transgressions that he has committed will be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he has done he will live.

23. Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Sovereign Yahweh; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?

24. But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the disgusting things that the wicked man does, will he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done will be remembered: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he will die.

25. Yet you{+} say, The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way fair? Are not your{+} ways unfair?

26. When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in it; in his iniquity that he has done he will die.

27. Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive.

28. Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he will surely live, he will not die.

29. Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, are not my ways fair? Are not your{+} ways unfair?

30. Therefore I will judge you{+}, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Sovereign Yahweh. Return{+}, and turn yourselves from all your{+} transgressions; so iniquity will not be your{+} ruin.

31. Cast away all your{+} transgressions from you{+}, by which you{+} have transgressed through them; and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you{+} die, O house of Israel?

32. For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies, says the Sovereign Yahweh: So turn yourselves, and live.

## Ezekiel 19

1. Moreover, take yourself up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

2. and say, What was your mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.

3. And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured man.

4. The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.

5. Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.

6. And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured man.

7. And he cast down his widows, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness of it, because of the noise of his roaring.

8. Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.

9. And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into fortresses, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.

10. Your mother was like a vine, in your blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.

11. And it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.

12. But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.

13. And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.

14. And fire has gone out of the rods of its branches, it has devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and will be for a lamentation.

## Ezekiel 20

1. And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh, and sat before me.

2. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

3. Son of Man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Is it to inquire of me that you{+} have come? As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, I will not be inquired of by you{+}.

4. Will you judge them, Son of Man, will you judge them? Cause them to know the disgusting things of their fathers;

5. and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am Yahweh your{+} God;

6. in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.

7. And I said to them, Cast{+} away every man the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Yahweh your{+} God.

8. But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

9. But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

10. So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if man does, he will live in them.

12. Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they didn't walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if man keeps, he will live in them; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them.

14. But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.

15. Moreover I also swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

16. because they rejected my ordinances, and didn't walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

17. Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.

18. And I said to their sons in the wilderness, Don't walk{+} in the statutes of your{+} fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.

19. I am Yahweh your{+} God: walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them;

20. and hallow my Sabbaths; and they will be a sign between me and you{+}, that you{+} may know that I am Yahweh your{+} God.

21. But the sons rebelled against me; they didn't walk in my statutes, neither kept my ordinances to do them, which if man does, he will live in them; they profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

22. Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.

23. Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;

24. because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.

25. Moreover I also gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live;

26. and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.

27. Therefore, Son of Man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In this moreover have your{+} fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

28. For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.

29. Then I said to them, What is the high place to where you{+} go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.

30. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Do you{+} pollute yourselves after the manner of your{+} fathers? And you{+} prostitute after their detestable things?

31. And when you{+} offer your{+} gifts, when you{+} make your{+} sons to pass through the fire, do you{+} pollute yourselves with all your{+} idols to this day? And shall I be inquired of by you{+}, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, I will not be inquired of by you{+};

32. and that which comes into your{+} mind will not be at all, in that you{+} say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to minister wood and stone.

33. As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you{+}:

34. and I will bring you{+} out from the peoples, and will gather you{+} out of the countries in which you{+} are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;

35. and I will bring you{+} into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you{+} face to face.

36. Like I entered into judgment with your{+} fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you{+}, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

37. And I will cause you{+} to pass under the rod, and I will bring you{+} into the bond of the covenant;

38. and I will purge out from among you{+} the rebels, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter into the land of Israel: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

39. As for you{+}, O house of Israel, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Go{+}, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you{+} will not listen to me; but my holy name you{+} will profane no more with your{+} gifts, and with your{+} idols.

40. For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Sovereign Yahweh, there will all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there I will accept them, and there I will require your{+} offerings, and the first fruits of your{+} oblations, with all your{+} holy things.

41. As a sweet savor I will accept you{+}, when I bring you{+} out from the peoples, and gather you{+} out of the countries in which you{+} have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you{+} in the sight of the nations.

42. And you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when I will bring you{+} into the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give to your{+} fathers.

43. And there you{+} will remember your{+} ways, and all your{+} doings, in which you{+} have polluted yourselves; and you{+} will loathe yourselves in your{+} own sight for all your{+} evils that you{+} have committed.

44. And you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you{+} for my name's sake, not according to your{+} evil ways, nor according to your{+} corrupt doings, O you{+} house of Israel, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

45. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

46. Son of Man, set your face toward the south, and drop [your word] toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;

47. and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Yahweh: Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I will kindle a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north will be burnt by it.

48. And all flesh will see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it; it will not be quenched.

49. Then I said, Ah Sovereign Yahweh! They say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?

## Ezekiel 21

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop [your word] toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;

3. and say to the land of Israel, Thus says Yahweh: Look, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.

4. Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore will my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

5. and all flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it will not return anymore.

6. Sigh therefore, you Son of Man; with the breaking of your loins and with bitterness you will sigh before their eyes.

7. And it will be, when they say to you, Why do you sigh? Then you will say, Because of the news, for it comes; and every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble, and every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water: look, it comes, and it will be done, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

8. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

9. Son of Man, prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;

10. it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? The rod of my son, it despises every tree.

11. And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yes, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.

12. Cry and wail, Son of Man; for it is on my people, it is on all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; strike therefore on your thigh.

13. For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that despises will be no more? says the Sovereign Yahweh.

14. You therefore, Son of Man, prophesy, and strike your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one who is deadly wounded, which enters into their chambers.

15. I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! It is made as lightning, it is sheathed for slaughter.

16. Gather yourself together, go to the right, set yourself in array, go to the left, wherever your face is set.

17. I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.

18. The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,

19. Also, you Son of Man, appoint for yourself two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they will both come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.

20. You will appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.

21. For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to tell his fortune: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the talismans, he looked in the liver.

22. In his right hand was the reading [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.

23. And it will be to them as a false reading in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.

24. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} have made your{+} iniquity to be remembered, in that your{+} transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your{+} doings your{+} sins appear; because you{+} have come to remembrance, you{+} will be taken with the hand.

25. And you, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,

26. thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; this [will be] no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.

27. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: neither has this taken place, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it [to him].

28. And you, Son of Man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh concerning the sons of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;

29. while they see for you false visions, while they tell you a lying fortune, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.

30. Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, I will judge you.

31. And I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy.

32. You will be for fuel to the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land; you will be no more remembered: for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 22

1. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. And you, Son of Man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her disgusting behaviors.

3. And you will say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that makes idols against herself to defile her!

4. You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near, and have come even to your years: therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.

5. Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will mock you, you infamous one [and] full of tumult.

6. Look, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.

7. In you they have set light by father and mother; in the midst of you they have dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in you they have wronged the fatherless and the widow.

8. You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.

9. Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood; and in you they have eaten on the mountains: in the midst of you they have committed lewdness.

10. In you they have uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.

11. And one has done a disgusting thing with his fellow man's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

12. In you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your fellow men by oppression, and have forgotten me, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

13. Look, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the midst of you.

14. Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I will deal with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and will do it.

15. And I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries; and I will consume your filthiness out of you.

16. And I will be profaned by you, in the sight of the nations; and you will know that I am Yahweh.

17. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

18. Son of Man, the house of Israel has become dross to me: all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.

19. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} have all become dross, therefore, look, I will gather you{+} into the midst of Jerusalem.

20. As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so I will gather you{+} in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you{+} there, and melt you{+}.

21. Yes, I will gather you{+}, and blow on you{+} with the fire of my wrath, and you{+} will be melted in the midst of it.

22. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so you{+} will be melted in the midst of it; and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you{+}.

23. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

24. Son of Man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.

25. There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst of it.

26. Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

27. Her princes in the midst of it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.

28. And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered [mortar], seeing false visions, and telling them lying fortunes, saying, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, when Yahweh has not spoken.

29. The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yes, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.

30. And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.

31. Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way I have brought on their heads, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

3. and they prostituted in Egypt; they prostituted in their youth; where their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were caressed.

4. And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.

5. And Oholah prostituted when she was mine; and she lusted after her lovers, on the nearby Assyrians,

6. who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.

7. And she bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomever she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself.

8. Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they caressed her virgin nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her.

9. Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she lusted after.

10. These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and they slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.

11. And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her prostitutions which were more than the prostitutions of her sister.

12. She lusted after the nearby Assyrians, governors and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.

13. And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.

14. And she increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,

15. girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them princes to look at, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.

16. And as soon as she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.

17. And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.

18. So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like my soul was alienated from her sister.

19. Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had prostituted in the land of Egypt.

20. And she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

21. Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when from Egypt they caressed your nipples and squeezed your youthful breasts.

22. Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side:

23. the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.

24. And they will come against you equipped with chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they will set themselves against you with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments.

25. And I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury; they will take away your nose and your ears; and your residue will fall by the sword: they will take your sons and your daughters; and your residue will be devoured by the fire.

26. They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.

27. Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution [brought] from the land of Egypt; so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.

28. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated;

29. and they will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare; and the nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.

30. These things will be done to you, for that you have prostituted after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.

31. You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.

32. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You will drink of your sister's cup, which is deep and large; you will be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.

33. You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.

34. You will even drink it and drain it out, and you will gnaw its sherds, and will tear your breasts; for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

35. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your prostitution.

36. Yahweh said moreover to me: Son of Man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their disgusting behaviors.

37. For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] to them for food.

38. Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.

39. For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, look, thus they have done in the midst of my house.

40. And furthermore you{+} have sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent, and, see, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,

41. and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, on which you set my incense and my oil.

42. And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and men of the multitude of man were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.

43. Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now they will still prostitute with her, and she [with them].

44. And they went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.

45. And righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.

46. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.

47. And the company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

48. Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your{+} lewdness.

49. And they will recompense your{+} lewdness on you{+}, and you{+} will bear the sins of your{+} idols; and you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, write for yourself the name of the day, [even] of this very same day: the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this very same day.

3. And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Set on the cauldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:

4. gather its pieces into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

5. Take the choice of the flock, and also pile the bones under it; make it boil well; yes, its bones were boiled in the midst of it.

6. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Woe to the bloody city, to the cauldron whose rust is in it, and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece; No lot has fallen on it.

7. For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.

8. That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.

9. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.

10. Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.

11. Then set it empty on its coals, that it may be hot, and its bronze may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.

12. It has frustrated the efforts [to clean it]; yet her great rust does not go forth out of her; her rust [does not go forth] by fire.

13. In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed you and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed from your filthiness anymore, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.

14. I, Yahweh, have spoken it: it will come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, they will judge you, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

15. Also the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

16. Son of Man, look, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you will neither mourn nor weep, neither will your tears run down.

17. Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind your headtire on you, and put your sandals on your feet, and don't cover your lips, and don't eat the bread of men.

18. So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

19. And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?

20. Then I said to them, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

21. Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your{+} power, the desire of your{+} eyes, and that which your{+} soul pities; and your{+} sons and your{+} daughters whom you{+} have left behind will fall by the sword.

22. And you{+} will do as I have done: you{+} will not cover your{+} lips, nor eat the bread of men.

23. And your{+} tires will be on your{+} heads, and your{+} sandals on your{+} feet: you{+} will not mourn nor weep; but you{+} will pine away in your{+} iniquities, and moan one toward another.

24. Thus Ezekiel will be to you{+} a sign; according to all that he has done you{+} will do: when this comes, then you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.

25. And you, Son of Man, will it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,

26. that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?

27. In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak, and be mute no more: so you will be a sign to them; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 25

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, set your face toward the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them:

3. and say to the sons of Ammon, Hear the word of the Sovereign Yahweh: Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:

4. therefore, look, I will deliver you to the sons of the east for a possession, and they will set their encampments in you, and make their dwellings in you; they will eat your fruit, and they will drink your milk.

5. And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the sons of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

6. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of your soul against the land of Israel;

7. therefore, look, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you will know that I am Yahweh.

8. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because Moab and Seir say, Look, the house of Judah is like all the nations;

9. therefore, look, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,

10. to the sons of the east, [to go] against the sons of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.

11. And I will execute judgments on Moab; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

12. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself on them;

13. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, I will stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even to Dedan they will fall by the sword.

14. And I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath; and they will know my vengeance, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

15. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity;

16. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the seacoast.

17. And I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I will lay my vengeance on them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken [that was] the gate of the peoples; she has turned to me; I will be replenished, now that she is laid waste:

3. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.

4. And they will destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.

5. She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh; and she will become a spoil to the nations.

6. And her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword: and they will know that I am Yahweh.

7. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.

8. He will slay with the sword your daughters in the field; and he will make forts against you, and cast up a mound against you, and raise up the buckler against you.

9. And he will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.

10. By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust will cover you: your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he will enter into your gates, as men enter into a city in which a breach is made.

11. With the hoofs of his horses he will tread down all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword; and the pillars of your strength will go down to the ground.

12. And they will make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise; and they will break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses; and they will lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters.

13. And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.

14. And I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets; you will be built no more: for I Yahweh have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

15. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to Tyre: will not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you?

16. Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments: they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, and will tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.

17. And they will take up a lamentation over you, and say to you, How you are destroyed, that were inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all who dwelt there!

18. Now will the isles tremble in the day of your fall; yes, the isles that are in the sea will be dismayed at your departure.

19. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: When I will make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I will bring up the deep on you, and the great waters will cover you;

20. then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time; and will make you to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, like places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you are not inhabited; but I will make glory in the land of the living.

21. I will make you a terror, and you will no more have any being; though you are sought for, yet you will never be found again, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,

2. And you, Son of Man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;

3. and say to Tyre, O you that dwell at the entry of the sea, that are the merchant of the peoples to many isles, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You, O Tyre, have said, I am perfect in beauty.

4. Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders have perfected your beauty.

5. They have made all your planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.

6. Of the oaks of Bashan they have made your oars; they have made your benches of ivory inlaid in cypress-wood, from the isles of Kittim.

7. Of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was your awning.

8. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers: your wise men, O Tyre, were in you, they were your pilots.

9. The old men of Gebal and its wise men were in you, your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to deal in your merchandise.

10. Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.

11. The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls round about, and valorous men were in your towers; they hanged their shields on your walls round about; they have perfected your beauty.

12. Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for your wares.

13. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traffickers; they traded the souls of man and vessels of bronze for your merchandise.

14. They of the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses and warhorses and mules.

15. The sons of Rodan were your traffickers; many isles were the mart of your hand: they brought you in exchange horns of ivory and ebony.

16. Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of your handiworks: they traded for your wares with emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.

17. Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your traffickers: they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.

18. Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool,

19. and the earthenware wine jars of Izalla, for your wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among your merchandise.

20. Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding.

21. Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of your hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these they were your merchants.

22. The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were your traffickers; they traded for your wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.

23. Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur [and] Chilmad, were your traffickers.

24. These were your traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, these were your merchandise.

25. The ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise: and you were replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.

26. Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas.

27. Your riches, and your wares, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the dealers in your merchandise, and all your men of war, who are in you, with all your company which is in the midst of you, will fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.

28. At the sound of the cry of your pilots the suburbs will shake.

29. And all who handled the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots of the sea, will come down from their ships; they will stand on the land,

30. and will cause their voice to be heard over you, and will cry bitterly, and will cast up dust on their heads, they will wallow themselves in the ashes:

31. and they will make themselves bald for you, and gird them with sackcloth, and they will weep for you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.

32. And in their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, [saying], Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?

33. When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many peoples; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.

34. In the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, your merchandise and all your company fell in the midst of you.

35. All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at you, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.

36. The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you have become a terror, and you will nevermore have any being.

## Ezekiel 28

1. The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, say to the leader of Tyre, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet you are man, and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of God;--

3. look, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from you;

4. by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten you riches, and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures;

5. by your great wisdom [and] by your traffic you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches;--

6. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,

7. therefore, look, I will bring strangers on you, the terrible of the nations; and they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they will defile your brightness.

8. They will bring you down to the pit; and you will die the death of those who are slain, in the heart of the seas.

9. Will you yet say before him who slays you, I am God? But you are man, and not God, in the hand of him who wounds you.

10. You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

11. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

12. Son of Man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You seal up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

13. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was in you; in the day that you were created they were prepared.

14. You were the anointed cherub that covers; I set you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

15. You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you.

16. By the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I have cast you as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

17. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness: I have cast you to the ground; I have laid you before kings, that they may look at you.

18. By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your traffic, you have profaned your sanctuaries; therefore I have brought forth a fire from the midst of you; it has devoured you, and I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all those who look at you.

19. All those who know you among the peoples will be astonished at you: you have become a terror, and you will nevermore have any being.

20. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

21. Son of Man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,

22. and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against you, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of you; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I will have executed judgments in her, and will be sanctified in her.

23. For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded will fall in the midst of her, with the sword on her on every side; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

24. And there will be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any who are round about them, who did despite to them; and they will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.

25. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: When I will have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they will dwell in their own land which I gave to my slave Jacob.

26. And they will dwell securely in it; yes, they will build houses, and plant vineyards, and will dwell securely, when I have executed judgments on all those who do them despite round about them; and they will know that I am Yahweh their God.

## Ezekiel 29

1. In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;

3. speak, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the crocodile that lies in the midst of his rivers, that has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.

4. And I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.

5. And I will cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you will fall on the open field; you will not be brought together nor gathered; I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.

6. And all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

7. When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and rent all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and made all their loins to be at a stand.

8. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off from you man and beast.

9. And the land of Egypt will be a desolation and a waste; and they will know that I am Yahweh. Because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it;

10. therefore, look, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.

11. No foot of man will pass through it, nor foot of beast will pass through it, neither will it be inhabited forty years.

12. And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste will be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

13. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;

14. and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they will be there a base kingdom.

15. It will be the basest of the kingdoms; neither will it anymore lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they will no more rule over the nations.

16. And it will be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.

17. And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

18. Son of Man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet he had no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.

19. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he will carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it will be the wages for his army.

20. I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

21. In that day I will cause a horn to bud forth to the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 30

1. The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Wail{+}, Alas for the day!

3. For the day is near, even the day of Yahweh is near; it will be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.

4. And a sword will come upon Egypt, and anguish will be in Ethiopia, when the slain will fall in Egypt; and they will take away her multitude, and her foundations will be broken down.

5. Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the sons of the land that is in league, will fall with them by the sword.

6. Thus says Yahweh: They also that uphold Egypt will fall; and the pride of her power will come down: from the tower of Seveneh they will fall in it by the sword, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

7. And they will be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities will be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.

8. And they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.

9. In that day messengers will go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there will be anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, look, it comes.

10. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

11. He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land; and they will draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

12. And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.

13. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there will be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.

14. And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments on No.

15. And I will pour my wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.

16. And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin will be in great anguish, and No will be broken up; and Memphis [will have] anguish daily.

17. The young men of On and of Pibeseth will fall by the sword; and these [cities] will go into captivity.

18. At Tehaphnehes also the day will withdraw itself, when I will break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power will cease in her: as for her, a cloud will cover her, and her daughters will go into captivity.

19. Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

20. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [month], in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

21. Son of Man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, look, it has not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it is strong to hold the sword.

22. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm], and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

23. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

24. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

25. And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh will fall down; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I will put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will stretch it out on the land of Egypt.

26. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 31

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third [month], in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom are you like in your greatness?

3. Look, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.

4. The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: its rivers ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.

5. Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot [them] forth.

6. All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.

7. Thus it was fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.

8. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.

9. I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.

10. Therefore thus said the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top to [reach] among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;

11. I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he will surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.

12. And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him.

13. On his ruin all the birds of the heavens will stay, and all the beasts of the field will be on his branches;

14. to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top to [reach] among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, [even] all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the sons of man, with those who go down to the pit.

15. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers; and the great waters were kept back; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.

16. I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.

17. They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, [that] dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.

18. To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth: you will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 32

1. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You were likened to a young lion of the nations: yet are you as a crocodile in the seas; and you broke forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.

3. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples; and they will bring you up in my net.

4. And I will leave you on the land, I will cast you forth on the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to stay on you, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you.

5. And I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.

6. I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim, even to the mountains; and the watercourses will be full of you.

7. And when I will extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light.

8. All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark over you, and set darkness on your land, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

9. I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I will bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.

10. Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings will be horribly afraid for you, when I will brandish my sword before them; and they will tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.

11. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you.

12. By the swords of the mighty I will cause your multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are all of them: and they will bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude will be destroyed.

13. I will destroy also all its beasts from beside many waters; neither will the foot of man trouble them anymore, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

14. Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

15. When I will make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I will strike all those who dwell in it, then they will know that I am Yahweh.

16. This is the lamentation with which they will lament; the daughters of the nations will lament with it; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, they will lament with it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

17. It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

18. Son of Man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the nether parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.

19. Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.

20. They will fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.

21. The strong among the mighty will speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him: they have gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

22. Asshur is there and all her company; their graves are round about them; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;

23. whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.

24. There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.

25. They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of those who are slain.

26. There is Meshech-Tubal and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.

27. And they will not lie with the mighty that have fallen of old, that have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for [they were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

28. But you will be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword.

29. There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword: they will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.

30. There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.

31. Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

32. For I put his terror in the land of the living; but he will be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 33

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, speak to the sons of your people, and say to them, When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;

3. if, when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people;

4. then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and does not take warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.

5. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not take warning; his blood will be on him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.

6. But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn't blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.

7. So you, Son of Man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

8. When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you will surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.

9. Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he does not turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.

10. And you, Son of Man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you{+} speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?

11. Say to them, As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn{+}, turn{+} from your{+} evil ways; for why will you{+} die, O house of Israel?

12. And you, Son of Man, say to the sons of your people, The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins.

13. When I say to the righteous, that he will surely live; if he trusts to his righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but in his iniquity that he has committed, in it he will die.

14. Again, when I say to the wicked, You will surely die; if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful and right;

15. if the wicked restores the pledge, gives again that which he had taken by robbery, walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he will surely live, he will not die.

16. None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he will surely live.

17. Yet the sons of your people say, The way of the Lord is not fair: but as for them, their way is not fair.

18. When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he will even die in it.

19. And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he will live by it.

20. Yet you{+} say, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, I will judge you{+} every one after his ways.

21. And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is struck.

22. Now the hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was mute no more.

23. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

24. Son of Man, those who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land was given to us for inheritance.

25. Therefore say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You{+} eat with the blood, and lift up your{+} eyes to your{+} idols, and shed blood: and will you{+} possess the land?

26. You{+} stand on your{+} sword, you{+} do disgusting things, and you{+} defile every one his fellow man's wife: and will you{+} possess the land?

27. Thus you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword; and him who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of the pestilence.

28. And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power will cease; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that none will pass through.

29. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all the disgusting things that they have done.

30. And as for you, Son of Man, the sons of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you{+}, and hear what the word is that comes forth from Yahweh.

31. And they come to you like the coming of a people, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don't do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.

32. And, look, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a beautiful voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they don't do them.

33. And when this comes to pass, (look, it comes,) then they will know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Woe to the shepherds of Israel that have been shepherding themselves! Should not the shepherds shepherd the sheep?

3. You{+} eat the milk, and you{+} clothe yourselves with the wool, you{+} kill the fatlings; but you{+} don't shepherd the sheep.

4. The diseased you{+} have not strengthened, neither have you{+} healed that which was sick, neither have you{+} bound up that which was broken, neither have you{+} brought back that which was driven away, neither have you{+} sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor you{+} have ruled over them.

5. And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.

6. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill: yes, my sheep were scattered on all the face of the earth; and there was none who searched or sought [after them].

7. Therefore, you{+} shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:

8. As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely since my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds shepherded themselves, and didn't shepherd my sheep;

9. therefore, you{+} shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:

10. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from shepherding the sheep; neither will the shepherds shepherd themselves anymore; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.

11. For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.

12. As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

13. And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will shepherd them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

14. I will shepherd them with good pasture; and on the mountains of the height of Israel will their fold be: there they will lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture they will be shepherded on the mountains of Israel.

15. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

16. I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will shepherd them in justice.

17. And as for you{+}, O my flock, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.

18. Does it seem a small thing to you{+} to have fed on the good pasture, but you{+} must tread down with your{+} feet the residue of your{+} pasture? And to have drank of the clear waters, but you{+} must foul the residue with your{+} feet?

19. And as for my sheep, they eat that which you{+} have trodden with your{+} feet, and they drink that which you{+} have fouled with your{+} feet.

20. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to them: Look, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

21. Because you{+} thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your{+} horns, until you{+} have scattered them abroad;

22. therefore I will save my flock, and they will no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

23. And I will set up another shepherd over them, and he will shepherd them, even my slave David; he will shepherd them, and he will be their shepherd.

24. And I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my slave David prince among them; I, Yahweh, have spoken it.

25. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they will dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

26. And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there will be showers of blessing.

27. And the tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure in their land; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those who made slaves of them.

28. And they will no more be a prey to the nations, neither will the beasts of the earth devour them; but they will dwell securely, and none will make them afraid.

29. And I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they will be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations anymore.

30. And they will know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

31. And you{+} my sheep, the sheep of my pasture: you{+} are man, [and] I am your{+} God, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 35

1. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

3. and say to it, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against you, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment.

4. I will lay your cities waste, and you will be desolate; and you will know that I am Yahweh.

5. Because you have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over the sons of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;

6. therefore, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, I will prepare you to blood, and blood will pursue you: since you have not hated blood, therefore blood will pursue you.

7. Thus I will make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns.

8. And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses they will fall who are slain with the sword.

9. I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

10. Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries will be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Yahweh was there:

11. therefore, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I will judge you.

12. And you will know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.

13. And you{+} have magnified yourselves against me with your{+} mouth, and have multiplied your{+} words against me: I have heard it.

14. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.

15. As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to you: you will be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 36

1. And you, Son of Man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, You{+} mountains of Israel, hear the word of Yahweh.

2. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because the enemy has said against you{+}, Aha! And, The ancient high places are ours in possession;

3. therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because, even because they have made you{+} desolate, and swallowed you{+} up on every side, that you{+} might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you{+} are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;

4. therefore, you{+} mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Yahweh: Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;

5. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, in order that its pasture ground [may be delivered] for plunder.

6. Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you{+} have borne the shame of the nations:

7. therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I have sworn, [saying], Surely the nations that are round about you{+}, they will bear their shame.

8. But you{+}, O mountains of Israel, you{+} will shoot forth your{+} branches, and yield your{+} fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.

9. For, look, I am for you{+}, and I will turn to you{+}, and you{+} will be tilled and sown;

10. and I will multiply man on you{+}, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities will be inhabited, and the waste places will be built;

11. and I will multiply on you{+} man and beast; and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you{+} to be inhabited after your{+} former estate, and will do better [to you{+}] than at your{+} beginnings: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

12. Yes, I will cause man to walk on you{+}, even my people Israel; and they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will no more from now on bereave them.

13. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because they say to you{+}, You [land] are a devourer of man, and have been a bereaver of your nation;

14. therefore you will devour man no more, neither bereave your nation anymore, says the Sovereign Yahweh;

15. neither will I let you hear anymore the shame of the nations, neither will you bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, neither will you cause your nation to stumble anymore, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

16. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

17. Son of Man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.

18. Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;

19. and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.

20. And when the people came to the nations, where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Yahweh, and have gone forth out of his land.

21. But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, where they went.

22. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I don't do [this] for your{+} sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you{+} have profaned among the nations, where you{+} went.

23. And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you{+} have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations will know that I am Yahweh, says the Sovereign Yahweh, when I will be sanctified in you{+} before their eyes.

24. For I will take you{+} from among the nations, and gather you{+} out of all the countries, and will bring you{+} into your{+} own land.

25. And I will sprinkle clean water on you{+}, and you{+} will be clean: from all your{+} filthiness, and from all your{+} idols, I will cleanse you{+}.

26. A new heart also I will give you{+}, and a new spirit I will put inside you{+}; and I will take away the stony heart out of your{+} flesh, and I will give you{+} a heart of flesh.

27. And I will put my Spirit inside you{+}, and cause you{+} to walk in my statutes, and you{+} will keep my ordinances, and do them.

28. And you{+} will dwell in the land that I gave to your{+} fathers; and you{+} will be my people, and I will be your{+} God.

29. And I will save you{+} from all your{+} uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you{+}.

30. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you{+} may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.

31. Then you{+} will remember your{+} evil ways, and your{+} doings that were not good; and you{+} will loathe yourselves in your{+} own sight for your{+} iniquities and for your{+} disgusting behaviors.

32. I don't do [this] for your{+} sake, says the Sovereign Yahweh, be it known to you{+}: be ashamed and confounded for your{+} ways, O house of Israel.

33. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In the day that I cleanse you{+} from all your{+} iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be built.

34. And the land that was desolate will be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.

35. And they will say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.

36. Then the nations that are left round about you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.

37. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with man like a flock.

38. As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of man; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.

2. And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, look, there were very many in the open valley; and, look, they were very dry.

3. And he said to me, Son of Man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Sovereign Yahweh, you know.

4. Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O you{+} dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.

5. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to these bones: Look, I will cause breath to enter into you{+}, and you{+} will live.

6. And I will lay sinews on you{+}, and will bring up flesh on you{+}, and cover you{+} with skin, and put breath in you{+}, and you{+} will live; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.

7. So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, look, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.

8. And I looked, and saw that there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.

9. Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, Son of Man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.

10. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.

11. Then he said to me, Son of Man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: look, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.

12. Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will open your{+} graves, and cause you{+} to come up out of your{+} graves, O my people; and I will bring you{+} into the land of Israel.

13. And you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your{+} graves, and caused you{+} to come up out of your{+} graves, O my people.

14. And I will put my Spirit in you{+}, and you{+} will live, and I will place you{+} in your{+} own land: and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.

15. The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,

16. And you, Son of Man, take for yourself one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his partners: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his partners:

17. and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.

18. And when the sons of your people will speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?

19. Say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his partners; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand.

20. And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.

21. And say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:

22. and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king to them all; and no more will they be two nations, neither will they be divided into two kingdoms anymore at all;

23. neither will they defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their backslidings, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so they will be my people, and I will be their God.

24. And my slave David will be king over them; and all of them will have one shepherd: they will also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.

25. And they will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my slave, in which your{+} fathers dwelt; and they will dwell in it, they, and their sons, and the sons of their sons, forever: and David my slave will be their prince forever.

26. Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.

27. My tabernacle also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.

28. And the nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary will be in the midst of them forevermore.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

2. Son of Man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

3. and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:

4. and I will turn you about, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;

5. Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;

6. Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with you.

7. Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies that are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.

8. After many days you will be visited: in the latter years you will come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they will dwell securely, all of them.

9. And you will ascend, you will come like a storm, you will be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, and many peoples with you.

10. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: It will come to pass in that day, that things will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil device:

11. and you will say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;

12. to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are [now] inhabited, and against the people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.

13. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, will say to you, Have you come to take the spoil? Have you assembled your company to take the prey? To carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?

14. Therefore, Son of Man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, will you not wake up?

15. And you will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you, and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army;

16. and you will come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it will come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I will be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.

17. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Are you he of whom I spoke in old time by my slaves the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for years that I would bring you against them?

18. And it will come to pass in that day, when Gog will come against the land of Israel, says the Sovereign Yahweh, that my wrath will come up into my nostrils.

19. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath I have spoken, Surely in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of Israel;

20. so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all of man who are on the face of the earth, will shake at my presence, and the mountains will be thrown down, and the steep places will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground.

21. And I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains, says the Sovereign Yahweh: every man's sword will be against his brother.

22. And with pestilence and with blood I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on the many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

23. And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 39

1. And you, Son of Man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:

2. and I will turn you about, and will lead you on, and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel;

3. and I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.

4. You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the peoples who are with you: I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.

5. You will fall on the open field; for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

6. And I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely in the isles; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

7. And my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned anymore: and the nations will know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel.

8. Look, it comes, and it will be done, says the Sovereign Yahweh; this is the day of which I have spoken.

9. And those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go forth, and will make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they will make fires of them seven years;

10. so that they will take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they will make fires of the weapons; and they will plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

11. And it will come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place of renown for burial in Israel, the valley of those who pass through on the east of the sea; and it will stop those who pass through: and there they will bury Gog and all his multitude; and they will call it The valley of Hamon-gog.

12. And seven months will the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.

13. Yes, all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be to them a renown in the day that I will be glorified, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

14. And they will set apart men of continual employment, that will pass through the land, and, with those who pass through, those who bury those who remain on the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months they will search.

15. And those who pass through the land will pass through; and when any sees man's bone, then he will set up a sign by it, until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.

16. And Hamonah will also be the name of a city. Thus they will cleanse the land.

17. And you, Son of Man, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you{+}, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you{+} may eat flesh and drink blood.

18. You{+} will eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

19. And you{+} will eat fat until you{+} are full, and drink blood until you{+} are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you{+}.

20. And you{+} will be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

21. And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations will see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.

22. So the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day and forward.

23. And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.

24. According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did to them; and I hid my face from them.

25. Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.

26. And they will bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they will dwell securely in their land, and none will make them afraid;

27. when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.

28. And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them to their own land; and I will leave none of them anymore there;

29. neither will I hide my face anymore from them; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in the very same day, the hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me there.

2. In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was, as it were the frame of a city on the south.

3. And he brought me there; and, look, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

4. And the man said to me, Son of Man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you, you were brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.

5. And, look, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

6. Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.

7. And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.

8. He measured also the porch of the gate,

9. eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.

10. And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; the three of them were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

11. And he measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;

12. and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

13. And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of five and twenty cubits; door against door.

14. He also made posts, threescore cubits; and the court [went] all round the gate [reaching] to the posts.

15. And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.

16. And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts inside the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and on [each] post were palm-trees.

17. Then brought he me into the outer court; and, look, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.

18. And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.

19. Then he measured the length from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north.

20. And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured its length and its width.

21. And its lodges were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arch was after the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.

22. And its windows, and its arch, and its palm-trees, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and its arch was before them.

23. And there was a gate to the inner court opposite the [other] gate, [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.

24. And he led me toward the south; and, look, a gate toward the south: and he measured its posts and its arch according to these measures.

25. And there were windows in it and in its arch round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.

26. And there were seven steps to go up to it, and its arch was before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts.

27. And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.

28. Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;

29. and its lodges, and its posts, and its arch, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in its arch round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

30. And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.

31. And its post was toward the outer court; and palm-trees were on its posts: and the ascent to it had eight steps.

32. And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;

33. and its lodges, and its posts, and its arch, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in its arch round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

34. And its post was toward the outer court; and palm-trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.

35. And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured [it] according to these measures;

36. its lodges, its posts, and its arch: and there were windows in it round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.

37. And its post was toward the outer court; and palm-trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.

38. And a chamber with its door was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.

39. And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay on them the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.

40. And on the [one] side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.

41. Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, on which they slew [the sacrifices].

42. And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; on which they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.

43. And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened inside round about: and the flesh of the oblation [was brought] to the tables.

44. And outside the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate, and their prospects were toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.

45. And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;

46. and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.

47. And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.

48. Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

49. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and on ten steps they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

## Ezekiel 41

1. And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the width of the tabernacle.

2. And the width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.

3. Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.

4. And he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the most holy place.

5. Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.

6. And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold, and not have hold in the wall of the house.

7. And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed [the house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the width of the house [continued] upward; and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the middle [chamber].

8. I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.

9. The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits, and that which was left of the structure of the side rooms which belonged to the house.

10. And between the chambers was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

11. And the doors of the side-chambers were toward [the place] that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the width of the place that was left was five cubits round about.

12. And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.

13. So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, a hundred cubits long;

14. also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.

15. And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the arches of the court;

16. the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),

17. to [the space] above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall round about inside and outside, by measure.

18. And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;

19. so that there was the face of man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. [Thus was it] made through all the house round about:

20. from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.

21. As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance [of it] was as the appearance [of the temple].

22. The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before Yahweh.

23. And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

24. And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves: two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other.

25. And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like were made on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.

26. And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.

## Ezekiel 42

1. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.

2. Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.

3. Opposite the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.

4. And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' width, and inward a passage of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.

5. Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.

6. For they were in three stories, and they did not have pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the uppermost] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

7. And the wall that was outside by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, its length was fifty cubits.

8. For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, look, before the temple were a hundred cubits.

9. And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.

10. In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place and before the building, there were chambers,

11. and the way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their width, and all their egresses were both according to their fashions. And as their doors,

12. so were also the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.

13. Then he said to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests who are near to Yahweh will eat the most holy things: there they will lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.

14. When the priests enter in, then they will not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they will lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they will put on other garments, and will approach to that which pertains to the people.

15. Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.

16. He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

17. He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.

18. He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

19. And he turned about to the west side: he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

20. He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.

## Ezekiel 43

1. Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east.

2. And, look, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.

3. And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.

4. And the glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

5. And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, look, the glory of Yahweh filled the house.

6. And I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me.

7. And he said to me, Son of Man, as for the place of my throne, and as for the place of the soles of my feet, [they will be] where I will stay in the midst of the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings [in] their high places;

8. in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was [but] the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by the disgusting behaviors that they have done: therefore I have consumed them in my anger.

9. Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will stay in the midst of them forever.

10. You, Son of Man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.

11. And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its egresses, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep its whole form, and all its ordinances, and do them.

12. This is the law of the house: on the top of the mountain the whole limit of it round about will be most holy. Look, this is the law of the house.

13. And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): And a hole of one cubit and the width a cubit, and its border by its edge round about a span; and this will be the base of the altar.

14. And from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge will be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge will be four cubits, and the width a cubit.

15. And the upper altar will be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there will be four horns.

16. And the altar hearth will be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad, square in its four sides.

17. And the ledge will be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad in its four sides; and the border about it will be half a cubit; and its bottom will be a cubit round about; and its steps will look toward the east.

18. And he said to me, Son of Man, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they will make it, to offer burnt-offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it.

19. You will give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me, says the Sovereign Yahweh, a young bull for a sin-offering.

20. And you will take of its blood, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border round about: thus you will cleanse it and make atonement for it.

21. You will also take the bull of the sin-offering, and it will be burnt in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.

22. And on the second day you will offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they will cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.

23. When you have made an end of cleansing it, you will offer a young bull without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

24. And you will bring them near before Yahweh, and the priests will cast salt on them, and they will offer them up for a burnt-offering to Yahweh.

25. Seven days you will prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they will also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

26. Seven days they will make atonement for the altar and purify it; so they will consecrate it.

27. And when they have accomplished the days, it will be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests will make your{+} burnt-offerings on the altar, and your{+} peace-offerings; and I will accept you{+}, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 44

1. Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut.

2. And Yahweh said to me, This gate will be shut; it will not be opened, neither will any man enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it will be shut.

3. As for the prince, he will sit in it as prince to eat bread before Yahweh; he will enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and will go out by the way of the same.

4. Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked and saw that the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh: and I fell on my face.

5. And Yahweh said to me, Son of Man, mark well, and look with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of Yahweh, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.

6. And you will say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: O you{+} house of Israel, let it suffice you{+} of all your{+} disgusting behaviors,

7. in that you{+} have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you{+} offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, [to add] to all your{+} disgusting behaviors.

8. And you{+} have not kept the charge of my holy things; but you{+} have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

9. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, will enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are among the sons of Israel.

10. But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity.

11. Yet they will be ministering in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they will slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they will stand before them to minister to them.

12. Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel; therefore I have lifted up my hand against them, says the Sovereign Yahweh, and they will bear their iniquity.

13. And they will not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and the disgusting things that they have done.

14. Yet I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service, and for all that will be done in it.

15. But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they will come near to me to minister to me; and they will stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, says the Sovereign Yahweh:

16. they will enter into my sanctuary, and they will come near to my table, to minister to me, and they will keep my charge.

17. And it will be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they will be clothed with linen garments; and no wool will come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and inside.

18. They will have linen tires on their heads, and will have linen breeches on their loins; they will not gird themselves with [anything that causes] sweat.

19. And when they go forth into the outer court to the people, they will put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they will put on other garments, that they do not sanctify the people with their garments.

20. Neither will they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long; they will only cut off the hair of their heads.

21. Neither will any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.

22. Neither will they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is put away; but they will take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.

23. And they will teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

24. And in a controversy they will stand to judge; according to my ordinances they will judge it: and they will keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they will hallow my Sabbaths.

25. And they will go in to no dead of man to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves.

26. And after he is cleansed, they will reckon to him seven days.

27. And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he will offer his sin-offering, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

28. And they will have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you{+} will give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.

29. They will eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel will be theirs.

30. And the first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your{+} oblations, will be for the priest: you{+} will also give to the priests the first of your{+} dough, to cause a blessing to rest on your house.

31. The priests will not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it is bird or beast.

## Ezekiel 45

1. Moreover, when you{+} will divide by lot the land for inheritance, you{+} will offer an oblation to Yahweh, a holy portion of the land; the length will be the length of five and twenty thousand [reeds], and the width will be twenty thousand: it will be holy in all its border round about.

2. Of this there will be for the holy place five hundred [in length] by five hundred [in width], square round about; and fifty cubits for its suburbs round about.

3. And of this measure you will measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a width of ten thousand: and in it will be the sanctuary, which is most holy.

4. It is a holy portion of the land; it will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister to Yahweh; and it will be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.

5. And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in width, will be to the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession to themselves, [for] cities to live in.

6. And you{+} will appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it will be for the whole house of Israel.

7. And [whatever is] for the prince [will be] on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.

8. In the land it will be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes will no more oppress my people; but they will give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.

9. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Let it suffice you{+}, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your{+} exactions from my people, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

10. You{+} will have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

11. The ephah and the bath will be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: its measure will be after the homer.

12. And the shekel will be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, will be your{+} maneh.

13. This is the oblation that you{+} will offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and you{+} will give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;

14. and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, [which is] ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)

15. and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

16. All the people of the land will give to this oblation for the prince in Israel.

17. And it will be the prince's part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he will prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.

18. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, you will take a young bull without blemish; and you will cleanse the sanctuary.

19. And the priest will take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it on the door-posts of the house, and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.

20. And so you will do on the seventh [day] of the month for everyone who errs, and for him who is simple: so you{+} will make atonement for the house.

21. In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month, you{+} will have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread will be eaten.

22. And on that day the prince will prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin-offering.

23. And the seven days of the feast he will prepare a burnt-offering to Yahweh, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.

24. And he will prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

25. In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, he will do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil.

## Ezekiel 46

1. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east will be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath day it will be opened, and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.

2. And the prince will enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and will stand by the post of the gate; and the priests will prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he will worship at the threshold of the gate: then he will go forth; but the gate will not be shut until the evening.

3. And the people of the land will worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.

4. And the burnt-offering that the prince will offer to Yahweh will be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;

5. and the meal-offering will be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

6. And on the day of the new moon it will be a young bull without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they will be without blemish:

7. and he will prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according to as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

8. And when the prince will enter, he will go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he will go forth by the way of it.

9. But when the people of the land will come before Yahweh in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship will go forth by the way of the south gate; and he who enters by the way of the south gate will go forth by the way of the north gate: he will not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but will go forth straight before him.

10. And the prince, when they go in, will go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they will go forth [together].

11. And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering will be an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

12. And when the prince will prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering to Yahweh, one will open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he will prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he does on the Sabbath day: then he will go forth; and after his going forth one will shut the gate.

13. And you will prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering to Yahweh daily: morning by morning you will prepare it.

14. And you will prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering to Yahweh continually by perpetual ordinances.

15. Thus they will prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.

16. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it will belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he gives of his inheritance a gift to one of his slaves, it will be his to the year of liberty; then it will return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it will be for his sons.

18. Moreover the prince will not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he will give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people are not scattered every man from his possession.

19. Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, see, there was a place on the hinder part westward.

20. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests will boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, [and] where they will bake the meal-offering; that they do not bring them forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.

21. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, look, in every corner of the court there was a court.

22. In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four set into the corners were of one measure.

23. And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.

24. Then he said to me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house will boil the sacrifice of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. And he brought me back to the door of the house; and, look, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.

2. Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of [the gate] that looks toward the east; and, look, there ran out waters on the right side.

3. When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.

4. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins.

5. Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.

6. And he said to me, Son of Man, have you seen [this]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.

7. Now when I had returned, look, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.

8. Then he said to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah; and they will go toward the sea; into the sea [will the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters will be healed.

9. And it will come to pass, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live; and there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and [the waters of the sea] will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes.

10. And it will come to pass, that fishers will stand by it: from En-gedi even to En-eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.

11. But its miry places, and its marshes, will not be healed; they will be given up to salt.

12. And by the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf will not wither, neither will its fruit fail: it will bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.

13. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: This will be the border, by which you{+} will divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [will have two] portions.

14. And you{+} will inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your{+} fathers: and this land will fall to you{+} for inheritance.

15. And this will be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.

17. And the border from the sea, will be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.

18. And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, will be the Jordan from the border to the east sea as far as Tamar. This is the east side.

19. And the south side southward will be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea. This is the south side southward.

20. And the west side will be the great sea, from the border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.

21. So you{+} will divide this land to you{+} according to the tribes of Israel.

22. And it will come to pass, that you{+} will divide it by lot for an inheritance to you{+} and to the strangers who sojourn among you{+}, who will beget sons among you{+}; and they will be to you{+} as the home-born among the sons of Israel; they will have inheritance with you{+} among the tribes of Israel.

23. And it will come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns, there you{+} will give him his inheritance, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

## Ezekiel 48

1. Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they will have their sides east [and] west,) Dan, one [portion].

2. And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one [portion].

3. And by the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side, Naphtali, one [portion].

4. And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one [portion].

5. And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one [portion].

6. And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the west side, Reuben, one [portion].

7. And by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one [portion].

8. And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, will be the oblation which you{+} will offer, five and twenty thousand [reeds] in width, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary will be in the midst of it.

9. The oblation that you{+} will offer to Yahweh will be five and twenty thousand [reeds] in length, and ten thousand in width.

10. And for these, even for the priests, will be the holy oblation: toward the north five and twenty thousand [in length], and toward the west ten thousand in width, and toward the east ten thousand in width, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of Yahweh will be in the midst of it.

11. [It will be] for the priests who are sanctified, the sons of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

12. And it will be to them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.

13. And answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites will have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in width: all the length will be five and twenty thousand, and the width ten thousand.

14. And they will sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor will the first fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy to Yahweh.

15. And the five thousand that are left in the width, in front of the five and twenty thousand, will be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city will be in the midst of it.

16. And these will be its measures: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

17. And the city will have suburbs: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

18. And the residue in the length, answerable to the holy oblation, will be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it will be answerable to the holy oblation; and its increase will be for food to those who labor in the city.

19. And those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, will till it.

20. All the oblation will be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: you{+} will offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.

21. And the residue will be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city; in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable to the portions, it will be for the prince: and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house will be in the midst of it.

22. Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it will be for the prince.

23. And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one [portion].

24. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one [portion].

25. And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one [portion].

26. And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one [portion].

27. And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one [portion].

28. And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border will be even from Tamar, the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea.

29. This is the land which you{+} will divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, says the Sovereign Yahweh.

30. And these are the egresses of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure;

31. and the gates of the city will be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.

32. And at the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one.

33. And at the south side four thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one.

34. At the west side four thousand and five hundred [reeds], with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.

35. It will be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about: and the name of the city from that day will be, Yahweh is there.
