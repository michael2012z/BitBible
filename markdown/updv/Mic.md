# Micah

## Micah 1

1. The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

2. Hear, you{+} peoples, all of you{+}: listen, O earth, and all that is in it: and let the Sovereign Yahweh be witness against you{+}, the Lord from his holy temple.

3. For, look, Yahweh comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread on the high places of the earth.

4. And the mountains will be melted under him, and the valleys will be split, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.

5. For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?

6. Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, [and] as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down her stones into the valley, and I will uncover her foundations.

7. And all her graven images will be beaten to pieces, and all her wages will be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay desolate; for of the wages of a prostitute she has gathered them, and to the wages of a prostitute they will return.

8. For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.

9. For her wounds are incurable; for it has come even to Judah; it reaches to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

10. Don't tell it in Gath, don't weep at all: at Beth-le-aphrah I have rolled myself in the dust.

11. Pass by, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan has not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel will take from you{+} its standing ground.

12. For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.

13. Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.

14. Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.

15. I will yet bring to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him who will possess you: the glory of Israel will come even to Adullam.

16. Make yourself bald, and cut off your hair for the sons of your delight: enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they have gone into captivity from you.

## Micah 2

1. Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds! When the morning is light, they do it, because it is in the power of their hand.

2. And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a [noble] man and his house, even a man and his heritage.

3. Therefore thus says Yahweh: Look, I devise an evil against this family, from which you{+} will not remove your{+} necks, neither will you{+} walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.

4. In that day they will take up a parable against you{+}, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We are completely ruined: he exchanges the portion of my people: how he removes [it] from me! In order to make restitution, he divides our fields.

5. Therefore you will have none who will cast the line by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.

6. Do not prophesy{+}, [thus] they prophesy. They will not prophesy to these: reproaches will not depart.

7. Will it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Yahweh straitened? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?

8. Even yesterday my people rose up as an enemy: in front of a cloak you{+} strip the glory from those who pass by securely, being averse to war.

9. The women of my people you{+} cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you{+} take away my glory forever.

10. Arise{+}, and depart; for this is not your{+} resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.

11. If a man walking after the wind and producing lies, lies, [saying], I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink; he will even be the prophet of this people.

12. I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they will make great noise by reason of man.

13. The breaker has gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and have gone out of it; and their king has passed on before them, and Yahweh at the head of them.

## Micah 3

1. And I said, Hear, I pray you{+}, you{+} heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you{+} to know justice?

2. You{+} who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

3. who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh inside the cauldron.

4. Then they will cry to Yahweh, but he will not answer them; yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, according to as they have wrought evil in their doings.

5. Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoever does not put into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:

6. Therefore it will be night to you{+}, that you{+} will have no vision; and it will be dark to you{+}, that you{+} will not have fortune-telling; and the sun will go down on the prophets, and the day will be black over them.

7. And the seers will be put to shame, and the fortune-tellers confounded; yes, they will all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.

8. But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh, and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

9. Hear this, I pray you{+}, you{+} heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, who are disgusted by justice, and pervert all equity.

10. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

11. The heads of it judge for reward, and its priests teach for wages, and its prophets tell the future for money: yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, Is not Yahweh in the midst of us? No evil will come upon us.

12. Therefore will Zion for your{+} sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem will become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.

## Micah 4

1. But in the latter days it will come to pass, that the mountain of Yahweh's house will be established on the top of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills; and peoples will flow to it.

2. And many nations will go and say, Come{+}, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem;

3. and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations far off: and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.

4. But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none will make them afraid: for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken it.

5. For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.

6. In that day, says Yahweh, I will assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;

7. and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Yahweh will reign over them in mount Zion from now on even forever.

8. And you, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come, yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

9. Now why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you, has your counselor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?

10. Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now you will go forth out of the city, and will stay in the field, and will come even to Babylon: there you will be rescued; there Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

11. And now many nations are assembled against you, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see [our desire] on Zion.

12. But they don't know the thoughts of Yahweh, neither do they understand his counsel; for he has gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.

13. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze; and you will beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain to Yahweh, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.

## Micah 5

1. Now gash yourself, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us; they will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.

2. But you, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which are little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of you will one come forth to me who is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.

3. Therefore he will give them up, until the time that she who travails has brought forth: then the residue of his brothers will return to the sons of Israel.

4. And he will stand, and will shepherd [his flock] in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God: and they will remain; for now he will be great to the ends of the earth.

5. And this [man] will be [our] peace. When the Assyrian will come into our land, and when he will tread in our palaces, then we will raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principals of man.

6. And they will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with the dagger: and he will deliver from the Assyrian, when he comes into our land, and when he treads inside our border.

7. And the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Yahweh, as showers on the grass, that do not tarry for man, nor wait for the sons of men.

8. And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver.

9. Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, and let all your enemies be cut off.

10. And it will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh, that I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will destroy your chariots:

11. and I will cut off the cities of your land, and will throw down all your strongholds.

12. And I will cut off sorcerers out of your hand; and you will have no psychics:

13. and I will cut off your graven images and your pillars out of the midst of you; and you will no more worship the work of your hands;

14. and I will pluck up your Asherim out of the midst of you; and I will destroy your cities.

15. And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations which did not listen.

## Micah 6

1. Hear{+} now what Yahweh says: Arise, contend before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.

2. Hear, O you{+} mountains, Yahweh's controversy, and you{+} enduring foundations of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.

3. O my people, what have I done to you? And in what have I wearied you? Testify against me.

4. For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of slaves; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

5. O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember] from Shittim to Gilgal, that you{+} may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.

6. How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?

7. Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

8. He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does Yahweh require of you, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?

9. The voice of Yahweh cries to the city, and wisdom will see your name: hear{+} the rod, and who has appointed it.

10. Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abhorred?

11. Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?

12. For its rich men are full of violence, and its inhabitants have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

13. Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound; I have made you desolate because of your sins.

14. You will eat, but not be satisfied; and your humiliation will be in the midst of you: and you will put away, but will not save; and that which you save I will give up to the sword.

15. You will sow, but will not reap; you will tread the olives, but you will not anoint with oil; and the vintage, but will not drink the wine.

16. For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and you{+} walk in their counsels; that I may make you a desolation, and her inhabitants a hissing: and you{+} will bear the reproach of my people.

## Micah 7

1. Woe is me! For I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fig.

2. The godly has perished from the earth, and the upright is not among man: all of them lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.

3. Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asks, and the judge [is ready] for a reward; and the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.

4. The best of them is as a brier; the upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge: the day of your watchmen, even your visitation, has come; now will be their perplexity.

5. Don't trust{+} in a companion; don't put{+} confidence in a best friend; keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.

6. For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

7. But as for me, I will look to Yahweh; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.

8. Don't rejoice against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I will arise; when I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.

9. I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I will see his righteousness.

10. Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, Where is Yahweh your God? My eyes will see [my desire] on her; now she will be trodden down as the mire of the streets.

11. A day for building your walls! In that day the decree will be far removed.

12. In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.

13. Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings.

14. Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which stay solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them pasture in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

15. As in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt I will show him marvelous things.

16. The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might; they will lay their hand on their mouth; their ears will be deaf.

17. They will lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they will come trembling out of their close places; they will come with fear to Yahweh our God, and will be afraid because of you.

18. Who is a God like you, that pardons iniquity, and passes over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in loving-kindness.

19. He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

20. You will perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the loving-kindness to Abraham, which you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
