# Nahum

## Nahum 1

1. The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

2. Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges; Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath; Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves [wrath] for his enemies.

3. Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave unpunished [the guilty]: Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

4. He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.

5. The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth arose at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell in it.

6. Who can stand before his indignation? And who can arise in the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.

7. Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.

8. But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.

9. What do you{+} devise against Yahweh? He will make a full end; affliction will not rise up the second time.

10. For entangled like thorns, and drunk as with their drink, they are consumed completely as dry stubble.

11. One has gone forth out of you, that devises evil against Yahweh, that counsels wickedness.

12. Thus says Yahweh: Though they are in full strength, and likewise many, even so they will be cut down, and he will pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.

13. And now I will break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds in sunder.

14. And Yahweh has given commandment concerning you, that no more of your name will be sown: out of the house of your gods I will cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make your grave; for you have not measured up.

15. Look, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, that publishes peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah, perform your vows; for the wicked one will no more pass through you; he is completely cut off.

## Nahum 2

1. He who dashes in pieces has come up against you: keep the fortress, watch the way, make your loins strong, fortify your power mightily.

2. For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.

3. The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots are blazing in the day of his preparation, and the cypress [spears] are brandished.

4. The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.

5. He remembers his nobles: they stumble in their march; they hurry to her wall, and the mantelet is prepared.

6. The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.

7. And he is drawn up, she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her female slaves moan as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts.

8. But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, [they cry]; but none looks back.

9. Take{+} the spoil of silver, take{+} the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.

10. She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melts, and the knees strike together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.

11. Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion [and] the lioness walked, the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

12. The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.

13. Look, I am against you, says Yahweh of hosts, and I will burn your crowd in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will be heard no more.

## Nahum 3

1. Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and rapine; the prey does not depart.

2. The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,

3. the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble on their bodies;--

4. because of the multitude of the prostitutions of the well-favored prostitute, the mistress of witchcrafts, that sells nations through her prostitutions, and families through her witchcrafts.

5. Look, I am against you, says Yahweh of hosts, and I will uncover your skirts on your face; and I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.

6. And I will cast detestable things on you, and make you vile, and will set you as a gazing-stock.

7. And it will come to pass, that all those who look at you will flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? From where shall I seek comforters for you?

8. Are you better than No-amon, that was situated among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, [and] her wall was more than the sea?

9. Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.

10. Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.

11. You also will be drunk; you will be hid; you also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy.

12. All your fortresses will be [like] fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.

13. Look, your people in the midst of you are women; the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies: the fire has devoured your bars.

14. Draw yourself water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the brickkiln.

15. There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you off; it will devour you like the cankerworm: make yourself many as the cankerworm; make yourself many as the locust.

16. You have multiplied your merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm ravages, and flees away.

17. Your princes are as the locusts, and your marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun rises they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.

18. Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; your nobles stay at rest; your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is none to gather them.

19. There is no assuaging of your hurt: your wound is grievous: all who hear the report of you clap their hands over you; for on whom has not your wickedness passed continually?
