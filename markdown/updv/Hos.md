# Hosea

## Hosea 1

1. The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.

2. When Yahweh spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, Go, take to yourself a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution; for the land commits great prostitution, [departing] from Yahweh.

3. So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she became pregnant, and bore him a son.

4. And Yahweh said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.

5. And it will come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

6. And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a daughter. And [Yahweh] said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.

7. But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

8. Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son.

9. And [Yahweh] said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for you{+} are not my people, and I will not be your{+} [God].

10. Yet the number of the sons of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, You{+} are not my people, it will be said to them, [You{+} are] the sons of the living God.

11. And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.

## Hosea 2

1. Say{+} to your{+} brothers, Ammi; and to your{+} sisters, Ruhamah.

2. Contend with your{+} mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

3. or else I will strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.

4. Yes, on her sons I will have no mercy; for they are sons of prostitution;

5. for their mother has prostituted; she who became pregnant with them has done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.

6. Therefore, look, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she will not find her paths.

7. And she will follow after her lovers, but she will not overtake them; and she will seek them, but will not find them: then will she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then it was better with me than now.

8. For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.

9. Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new wine in its season, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.

10. And now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none will deliver her out of my hand.

11. I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.

12. And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field will eat them.

13. And I will visit on her the days of the Baalim, to which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says Yahweh.

14. Therefore, look, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.

15. And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

16. And it will be at that day, says Yahweh, that you will call: Ishi; and will call me no more: Baali.

17. For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they will no more be mentioned by their name.

18. And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.

19. And I will betroth you to me forever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.

20. I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you will know Yahweh.

21. And it will come to pass in that day, I will answer, says Yahweh, I will answer the heavens, and they will answer the earth;

22. and the earth will answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they will answer Jezreel.

23. And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people; and they will say, [You are] my God.

## Hosea 3

1. And Yahweh said to me, Go again, love a woman loved by a companion, but [is] an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.

2. So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;

3. and I said to her, You will remain with me many days; you will not prostitute; and you will not have any sex with any man--not even me.

4. For the sons of Israel will remain many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or talismans:

5. afterward the sons of Israel will return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and will come with fear to Yahweh and to his goodness in the latter days.

## Hosea 4

1. Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} sons of Israel; for Yahweh has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.

2. Swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and committing adultery are rampant; and blood is everywhere.

3. Therefore the land will mourn, and everyone who dwells in it will languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yes, the fish of the sea also will be taken away.

4. Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for your people are as those who strive with the priest.

5. And you will stumble in the day, and the prophet also will stumble with you in the night; and I will destroy your mother.

6. My people are destroyed for lack of the knowledge [of God]: because you have rejected the knowledge [of God], I will also reject you, that you will be no priest to me: seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your sons.

7. As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.

8. They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.

9. And it will be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.

10. And they will eat, and not have enough; they will cause prostitution, and will not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Yahweh.

11. Prostitution and wine and new wine take away the understanding.

12. My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them; for the spirit of prostitution has caused them to err, and they have prostituted, [departing] from under their God.

13. They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because their shadow is good: therefore your{+} daughters commit prostitution, and your{+} brides commit adultery.

14. I will not punish your{+} daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your{+} brides when they commit adultery; for [the men] themselves go apart with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with prostitutes; and the people that does not understand will be overthrown.

15. Though you, Israel, are prostituting, yet don't let Judah offend; and don't come{+} to Gilgal, neither go{+} up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Yahweh lives.

16. For Israel has behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now Yahweh will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

17. Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.

18. Their drink has become sour; they prostitute continually; her rulers dearly love shame.

19. The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; and they will be put to shame because of their altars.

## Hosea 5

1. Hear this, O you{+} priests, and listen, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for to you{+} pertains the judgment; for you{+} have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.

2. And the revolters have gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.

3. I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have prostituted, Israel is defiled.

4. Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is inside them, and they don't know Yahweh.

5. And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity; Judah also will stumble with them.

6. They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they will not find him: he has withdrawn himself from them.

7. They have betrayed Yahweh; for they have borne strange sons: now will the new moon devour them with their fields.

8. Blow{+} the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind you, O Benjamin.

9. Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which will surely be.

10. The princes of Judah are like those who remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath on them like water.

11. Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was determined to walk after crap.

12. Therefore I am to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.

13. When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king: but he is not able to heal you{+}, neither will he cure you{+} of your{+} wound.

14. For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there will be none to deliver.

15. I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.

## Hosea 6

1. Come, and let us return to Yahweh; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck, and he will bind us up.

2. After two days he will revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we will live before him.

3. And let us know, let us follow on to know Yahweh: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.

4. O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your{+} goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes early away.

5. Therefore I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and my judgment goes forth as the light.

6. For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.

7. But they like man have transgressed the covenant: there they have betrayed me.

8. Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.

9. And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yes, they have committed lewdness.

10. In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there prostitution is [found] in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

11. Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I bring back the captivity of my people.

## Hosea 7

1. When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the troop of robbers ravages outside.

2. And they don't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.

3. They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.

4. They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceases to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.

5. On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.

6. For they have brought their heart into their ambush, as into an oven: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.

7. They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings have fallen: there is none among them who calls to me.

8. Ephraim, he mixes himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.

9. Strangers have devoured his strength, and he does not know [it]: yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he does not know [it].

10. And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: yet they have not returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this.

11. And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.

12. When they will go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.

13. Woe to them! For they have wandered from me; destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

14. And they have not cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds: they gash themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.

15. Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they devise mischief against me.

16. They return, but not upwards; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this will be their derision in the land of Egypt.

## Hosea 8

1. [Set] the trumpet to your mouth. As an eagle [he comes] against the house of Yahweh, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

2. They will cry to me, My God, we Israel know you.

3. Israel has cast off that which is good: the enemy will pursue him.

4. They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I did not know it: of their silver and their gold they have made for themselves idols, that they may be cut off.

5. He has cast off your calf, O Samaria; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be before they attain to innocence?

6. For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is not God; yes, the calf of Samaria will be broken in pieces.

7. For they sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind: he has no standing grain; the blade will yield no meal; if it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.

8. Israel is swallowed up: now they are among the nations as a vessel in which none delights.

9. For they have gone up to Assyria, [like] a wild donkey alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.

10. Yes, though they hire among the nations, now I will gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.

11. Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been to him for sinning.

12. I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.

13. As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Yahweh does not accept them: now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they will return to Egypt.

14. For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire on their cities, and it will devour their castles.

## Hosea 9

1. Don't rejoice, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for you have prostituted [away] from your God; you have loved hire on every grain-floor.

2. The threshing-floor and the wine press will not feed them, and the new wine will fail her.

3. They will not dwell in Yahweh's land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.

4. They will not pour out wine-offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices will be to them as the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite; it will not come into the house of Yahweh.

5. What will you{+} do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?

6. For, look, they have gone away from destruction; [yet] Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles will possess them; thorns will be in their tents.

7. The days of visitation have come, the days of recompense have come; Israel will know it: the prophet is a fool, the man who has the spirit is insane, for the abundance of your iniquity, and because the enmity is great.

8. Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.

9. They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.

10. I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your{+} fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became detestable things like that which they loved.

11. As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird: there will be no birth, and no pregnancy, and no conception.

12. Though they bring up their sons, yet I will bereave them, so that man will not be left: yes, woe also to them when I depart from them!

13. I saw Ephraim as a grove of palm trees planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim will bring out his sons to the slayer.

14. Give them, O Yahweh--what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

15. All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.

16. Ephraim is struck, their root is dried up, they will bear no fruit: yes, though they bring forth, yet I will slay the beloved fruit of their womb.

17. My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.

## Hosea 10

1. Israel is a luxuriant vine, that puts forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.

2. Their heart is divided; now they will be found guilty: he will strike their altars, he will destroy their pillars.

3. Surely now they will say, We have no king; for we don't fear Yahweh; and the king, what can he do for us?

4. They speak [vain] words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

5. The neighbor of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for its people will mourn over it, and its priests who rejoiced over it, for its glory, because it has departed from it.

6. It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to the great king: Ephraim will receive shame, and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.

7. Samaria is cut off, her king as a twig on the water.

8. The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars; and they will say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.

9. O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the sons of iniquity does not overtake them in Gibeah.

10. When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples will be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two furrows.

11. And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loves to tread out [the grain]; but I have passed by her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah will plow, Jacob will break his clods.

12. Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your{+} fallow ground; for it is time to seek Yahweh, until he comes and rains righteousness on you{+}.

13. You{+} have plowed wickedness, you{+} have reaped iniquity; you{+} have eaten the fruit of lies; for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.

14. Therefore will a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her sons.

15. So Beth-el will do to you{+} because of your{+} great wickedness: at daybreak the king of Israel will be completely cut off.

## Hosea 11

1. When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt.

2. The more [the prophets] called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

3. Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; He took them up in his arms; but they did not know that I healed them.

4. I drew them with cords of man, with bands of love; and I was to them as those who lift up the yoke from their jaws; and I laid food before them.

5. They will not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian will be their king, because they refused to return [to me].

6. And the sword will fall on their cities, and will consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.

7. And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to [him who is] on high, none at all will exalt [him].

8. How shall I give you up, Ephraim? [How] shall I cast you off, Israel? How shall I make you as Admah? [How] shall I set you as Zeboiim? My heart is turned inside me, my compassions are kindled together.

9. I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; and I will not come in wrath.

10. They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the sons will come trembling from the west.

11. They will come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, says Yahweh.

12. Ephraim circles me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; and even Judah went down from God and the faithful Holy One.

## Hosea 12

1. Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he continually multiplies lies and violence; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.

2. Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings he will recompense him.

3. In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:

4. yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spoke with us,

5. even Yahweh, the God of hosts; Yahweh is his memorial [name].

6. Therefore you will turn to your God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for your God continually.

7. [He is] a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.

8. And Ephraim said, Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself: in all my labors they will find in me no iniquity which [would be] sin.

9. But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make you to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.

10. I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the hand of the prophets I have used similitudes.

11. Is Gilead iniquity? They are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yes, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.

12. And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep].

13. And by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.

14. Ephraim has provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore his blood will be left on him, and his reproach his Lord will return to him.

## Hosea 13

1. When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.

2. And now they sin more and more, and have made for themselves molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let man who sacrifices kiss the calves.

3. Therefore they will be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passes early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

4. Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; and you will know no god but me, and besides me there is no savior.

5. I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.

6. According to their pasture, so they were filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore they have forgotten me.

7. Therefore I am to them as a lion; as a leopard I will watch by the way;

8. I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart; and there I will devour them like a lioness; the wild beast will tear them.

9. It is your destruction, O Israel, that [you are] against me, against your help.

10. Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? And your judges, of whom you said, Give me a king and princes?

11. I have given you a king in my anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.

12. The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.

13. The sorrows of a travailing woman will come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of sons.

14. I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O Death, I will be your plague. O Sheol, I will be your destruction. Repentance will be hid from my eyes.

15. Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come, the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness; and his spring will become dry, and his fountain will be dried up: he will make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.

16. Samaria will bear her guilt; for she has rebelled against her God: they will fall by the sword; their infants will be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women will be ripped up.

## Hosea 14

1. O Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity.

2. Take with you{+} words, and return to Yahweh: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so we will render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips.

3. Assyria will not save us; we will not ride on horses; neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands, [You{+} are] our gods; for in you the fatherless finds mercy.

4. I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him.

5. I will be as the dew to Israel; he will blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

6. His branches will spread, and his beauty will be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

7. Those who dwell under his shadow will return; they will revive the grain, and blossom as the vine: his scent will be as the wine of Lebanon.

8. Ephraim [will say], What have I to do anymore with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is your fruit found.

9. Who is wise, that he may understand these things? Prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of Yahweh are right, and the just will walk in them; but transgressors will fall in them.
