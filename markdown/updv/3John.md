# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1. The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.

2. Beloved, I pray that in all things you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.

3. For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and bore witness to your truth, even as you walk in truth.

4. I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.

5. Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you do toward those who are brothers and strangers as well;

6. who bore witness to your love before the church: whom you will do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:

7. because for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

8. We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be coworkers for the truth.

9. I wrote somewhat to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, doesn't receive us.

10. Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, talking foolishly against us with wicked words. And not content with this, he doesn't receive the brothers either, and he forbids and casts out of the church those who would.

11. Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has not seen God.

12. Demetrius has the witness of all [men], and of the truth itself: yes, we also bear witness: and you know that our witness is true.

13. I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write [them] to you with ink and pen:

14. but I hope shortly to see you, and we will speak face to face. [15] Peace [be] to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
