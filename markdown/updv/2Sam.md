# 2 Samuel

## 2 Samuel 1

1. And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had remained two days in Ziklag;

2. it came to pass on the third day, that, look, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

3. And David said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel I have escaped.

4. And David said to him, How did it go? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people also fell and have died; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

5. And David said to the young man that told him, How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?

6. And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, I saw that Saul was leaning on his spear; and that the chariots and the horsemen stuck [close] to him.

7. And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here I am.

8. And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.

9. And he said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and slay me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.

10. So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he fell: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.

11. Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men who were with him:

12. and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they fell by the sword.

13. And David said to the young man that told him, Where are you from? And he answered, I am the son of a man who is a sojourner, an Amalekite.

14. And David said to him, Why weren't you afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?

15. And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. And he struck him, so that he died.

16. And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.

17. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.

18. And he bade them teach the sons of Judah, The Bow. Look, it is written in the Book of Jashar:

19. Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How are the mighty fallen!

20. Don't tell it in Gath, Don't proclaim the news in the streets of Ashkelon; Or else the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, Or else the daughters of the uncircumcised will triumph.

21. You{+} mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain on you{+}, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.

22. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan didn't turn back, And the sword of Saul didn't return empty.

23. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.

24. You{+} daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you{+} in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold on your{+} apparel.

25. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.

26. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant you have been to me: Your love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.

27. How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!

## 2 Samuel 2

1. And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Yahweh said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.

2. So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

3. And his men who were with him David brought up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

4. And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were those who buried Saul.

5. And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be you{+} of Yahweh, that you{+} have shown this kindness to your{+} lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.

6. And now Yahweh show loving-kindness and truth to you{+}: and I also will requite you{+} this kindness, because you{+} have done this thing.

7. Now therefore let your{+} hands be strong, and be{+} valiant; for Saul your{+} lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.

8. Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ishbaal the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

9. and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

10. Ishbaal, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.

11. And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

12. And Abner the son of Ner, and the slaves of Ishbaal the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

13. And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the slaves of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

14. And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray you, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

15. Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbaal the son of Saul, and twelve of the slaves of David.

16. And they caught every one his fellow man by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow man's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

17. And the battle was very intense that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the slaves of David.

18. And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

19. And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

20. Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.

21. And Abner said to him, Turn yourself aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay yourself hold on one of the young men, and take yourself his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.

22. And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn yourself aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?

23. Nevertheless he refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

24. But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

25. And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.

26. Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Will the sword devour forever? Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brothers?

27. And Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.

28. So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight anymore.

29. And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.

30. And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's slaves nineteen men and Asahel.

31. But the slaves of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and threescore men died.

32. And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 3

1. Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

2. And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

3. and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

4. and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;

5. and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.

6. And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.

7. Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth son of Saul said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?

8. Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? This day I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman.

9. God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I do not even do so to him;

10. to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.

11. And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.

12. And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? Saying [also], Make your league with me, and, look, my hand will be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.

13. And he said, Good; I will make a league with you; but one thing I require of you: that is, you will not see my face, except you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.

14. And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

15. And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.

16. And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, Go, return: and he returned.

17. And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past you{+} sought for David to be king over you{+}:

18. now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my slave David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

19. And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.

20. So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.

21. And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

22. And, look, the slaves of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner wasn't with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

23. When Joab and all the host that was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.

24. Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?

25. You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.

26. And when Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David didn't know it.

27. And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

28. And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:

29. let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.

30. So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

31. And David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Rend your{+} clothes, and gird you{+} with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And King David followed the bier.

32. And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

33. And the king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?

34. Your hands were not bound, and your feet were not put into fetters: As a man falls before the sons of iniquity, so did you fall. And all the people wept again over him.

35. And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun is down.

36. And all the people took note of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.

37. So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it wasn't of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

38. And the king said to his slaves, Don't you{+} know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?

39. And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.

## 2 Samuel 4

1. And when Ishbosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

2. And Ishbosheth, Saul's son, had two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:

3. and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).

4. Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she hurried to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibaal.

5. And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.

6. And, look, they came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

7. Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they struck him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.

8. And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Look, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

9. And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

10. when one told me, saying, Look, Saul is dead, and he was a bearer of good news in his own eyes, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his good news.

11. How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your{+} hand, and take you{+} away from the earth?

12. And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner the son of Ner in Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 5

1. Then all the tribes of Israel came to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Look, we are your bone and your flesh.

2. In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh said to you, You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be leader over Israel.

3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh: and they anointed David king over Israel.

4. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.

5. In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

6. And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you will not come in here; thinking, David can't come in here.

7. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.

8. And David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him reach the watershaft and the lame and the blind, who hated David's soul. Therefore they say, The blind and the lame will not come into the house.

9. And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.

10. And David waxed greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of hosts, was with him.

11. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.

12. And David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.

13. And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.

14. And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

15. and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

16. and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.

17. And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.

18. Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

19. And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand? And Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.

20. And David came to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

21. And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.

22. And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

23. And when David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You will not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them across from the mulberry-trees.

24. And it will be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then you will bestir yourself; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the host of the Philistines.

25. And David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.

## 2 Samuel 6

1. And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.

2. And David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, who is called by the name: Yahweh of hosts who sits above the cherubim.

3. And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the cart

4. with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.

5. And David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all [instruments made of] fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.

6. And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.

7. And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for the error; and there he died by the ark of God.

8. And David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, to this day.

9. And David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How will the ark of Yahweh come to me?

10. So David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

11. And the ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.

12. And it was told King David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.

13. And it was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.

14. And David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.

15. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

16. And it was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.

17. And they brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.

18. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts.

19. And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a cake of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.

20. Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the female slaves of his slaves, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!

21. And David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel: therefore I will play before Yahweh.

22. And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my sight: but of the female slaves of whom you have spoken, of them I will be honored.

23. And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.

## 2 Samuel 7

1. And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies round about,

2. that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells inside curtains.

3. And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.

4. And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,

5. Go and tell my slave David, Thus says Yahweh, Will you build me a house for me to dwell in?

6. For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

7. In all places in which I have walked with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have you{+} not built me a house of cedar?

8. Now therefore thus you will say to my slave David, Thus says Yahweh of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that you should be leader over my people, over Israel;

9. and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.

10. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may stay in their own place, and be moved no more; neither will the sons of wickedness afflict them anymore, as at the first,

11. and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.

12. When your days are fulfilled, and you will sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, that will proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

13. He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

14. I will be his father, and he will be my son: if he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of man;

15. but my loving-kindness will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.

16. And your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you: your throne will be established forever.

17. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.

18. Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, O Sovereign Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?

19. And this was yet a small thing in your eyes, O Sovereign Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your slave's house for a great while to come; and this is the law of man, O Sovereign Yahweh!

20. And what more can David say to you? For you know your slave, O Sovereign Yahweh.

21. For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, you have wrought all this greatness, to make your slave know it.

22. Therefore you are great, O Yahweh God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

23. And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel, whose God went and redeemed a people for himself, and made a name for himself, and did great and awesome things for you{+} to drive out nations and their gods before your people, whom you redeemed to yourself from Egypt?

24. And you established to yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.

25. And now, O Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your slave, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.

26. And let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of your slave David will be established before you.

27. For you, O Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your slave, saying, I will build you a house: therefore has your slave found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.

28. And now, O Sovereign Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your slave:

29. now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your slave, that it may continue forever before you; for you, O Sovereign Yahweh, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your slave be blessed forever.

## 2 Samuel 8

1. And after this it came to pass, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.

2. And he struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became slaves to David, and brought tribute.

3. David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.

4. And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.

5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

6. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became slaves to David, and brought tribute. And Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

7. And David took the shields of gold that were on the slaves of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

8. And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took exceedingly much bronze.

9. And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the host of Hadadezer,

10. then Toi sent Joram his son to King David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And [Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze:

11. These also did King David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;

12. of Edom, and of Moab, and of the sons of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

13. And David got a name for himself when he returned from striking the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.

14. And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became slaves to David. And Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

15. And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people.

16. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;

17. and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;

18. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

## 2 Samuel 9

1. And David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

2. And there was of the house of Saul a slave whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, Your slave is he.

3. And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.

4. And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Look, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.

5. Then King David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.

6. And Mephibaal, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibaal. And he answered, Look, your slave!

7. And David said to him, Don't be afraid; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you will eat bread at my table continually.

8. And he did obeisance, and said, What is your slave, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?

9. Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's attendant, and said to him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's son.

10. And you will till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your slaves; and you will bring in [the fruits], that your master's house may have bread to eat: but Mephibaal your master's son will always eat bread at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty slaves.

11. Then Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his slave, so will your slave do. As for Mephibaal, [the king said], he will eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.

12. And Mephibaal had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were slaves to Mephibaal.

13. So Mephibaal dwelt in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king's table. And he was lame in both his feet.

## 2 Samuel 10

1. And it came to pass after this, that the king of the sons of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

2. And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent by his slaves to comfort him concerning his father. And David's slaves came into the land of the sons of Ammon.

3. But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Has not David sent his slaves to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?

4. So Hanun took David's slaves, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

5. When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your{+} beards are grown, and then return.

6. And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.

7. And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.

8. And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.

9. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:

10. And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the sons of Ammon.

11. And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you will help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.

12. Be strong and we will be strengthened for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh will do that which is good in his eyes.

13. So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

14. And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the sons of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.

15. And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.

16. And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.

17. And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

18. And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.

19. And when all the kings who were slaves to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore.

## 2 Samuel 11

1. And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his slaves with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the sons of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.

2. And it came to pass at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look at.

3. And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

4. And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her, for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she returned to her house.

5. And the woman became pregnant; and she sent and told David, and said, I am pregnant.

6. And David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.

7. And when Uriah came to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.

8. And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess [of food] from the king.

9. But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the slaves of his lord, and didn't go down to his house.

10. And when they had told David, saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Aren't you coming from a journey? Why didn't you go down to your house?

11. And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, remain in booths; and my lord Joab, and the slaves of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.

12. And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.

13. And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk: and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the slaves of his lord, but didn't go down to his house.

14. And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

15. And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set{+} Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire{+} from him, that he may be struck, and die.

16. And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.

17. And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the slaves of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.

18. Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;

19. and he charged the messenger, saying, When you have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,

20. it will be that, if the king's wrath arises, and he says to you, Why did you{+} go so near to the city to fight? Didn't you{+} know that they would shoot from the wall?

21. Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal? Didn't a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you{+} go so near the wall? Then you will say, Your slave Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

22. So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.

23. And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.

24. And the shooters shot at your slaves from off the wall; and some of the king's slaves are dead, and your slave Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

25. Then David said to the messenger, Thus you will say to Joab, Don't let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage him.

26. And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.

27. And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.

## 2 Samuel 12

1. And Yahweh sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.

2. The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds;

3. but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his sons; it ate of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.

4. And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who came to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who came to him.

5. And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die:

6. and he will restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.

7. And Nathan said to David, You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;

8. and I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added to you such and such things.

9. Why have you despised Yahweh, to do that which is evil in his eyes? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.

10. Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.

11. Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your fellow man, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.

12. For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.

13. And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Yahweh. And Nathan said to David, Yahweh also has put away your sin; you will not die.

14. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have shown utter contempt for Yahweh, the son also who is born to you will surely die.

15. And Nathan departed to his house. And Yahweh struck the child who Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.

16. David therefore implored God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.

17. And the elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.

18. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the slaves of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Look, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn't listen to our voice: how he will then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!

19. But when David saw that his slaves were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his slaves, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

20. Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Yahweh, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.

21. Then his slaves said to him, What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose and ate bread.

22. And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?

23. But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.

24. And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he named him Solomon. And Yahweh loved him;

25. and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.

26. Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and took the royal city.

27. And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of waters.

28. Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; or else I will take the city, and it will be called after my name.

29. And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

30. And he took the crown of Milcom from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and [in it were] precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceedingly much.

31. And he brought forth the people who were in it. And he put [them to work] with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes of iron. And he made them serve making bricks. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 13

1. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.

2. And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.

3. But Amnon had a companion, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.

4. And he said to him, Why, O son of the king, are you thus lean from day to day? Will you not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

5. And Jonadab said to him, Lay down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray you, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.

6. So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray you, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.

7. Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.

8. So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.

9. And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.

10. And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

11. And when she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.

12. And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: don't do this folly.

13. And I, where shall I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.

14. Nevertheless he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.

15. Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, go.

16. And she said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.

17. Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

18. And she had a garment of diverse colors on her; for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins appareled. Then his minister brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

19. And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of diverse colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.

20. And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister: he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.

21. But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry, but he did not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon because he loved him, since he was his firstborn.

22. And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

23. And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.

24. And Absalom came to the king, and said, Look now, your slave has sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray you, and his slaves go with your slave.

25. And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. And he pressed him: nevertheless he would not go, but blessed him.

26. Then Absalom said, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?

27. But Absalom pressed him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the king's sons. And Absalom prepared a feast like a king's feast.

28. And Absalom commanded his attendants, saying, Now watch{+}, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say to you{+}, Strike Amnon, then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I commanded you{+}? Be courageous, and be valiant.

29. And the attendants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.

30. And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.

31. Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his slaves stood by with their clothes rent.

32. And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Don't let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.

33. Now therefore don't let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.

34. But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that many people came upon the Horonaim road, from the mountain side on the slope, and the watchman came and informed the king; he said, I saw men from the Horonaim road, from the mountain side.

35. And Jonadab said to the king, Look, the king's sons have come: as your slave said, so it is.

36. And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, look, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his slaves wept very intensely.

37. But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.

38. So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

39. And the king's spirit longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

## 2 Samuel 14

1. Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.

2. And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray you, and don't anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman that has a long time mourned for the dead:

3. and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.

4. And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

5. And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.

6. And your female slave had two sons, and both of them strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him.

7. And, look, the whole family has risen against your female slave, and they say, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus they will quench my charcoal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the face of the earth.

8. And the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give charge concerning you.

9. And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be innocent.

10. And the king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore.

11. Then she said, I pray you, let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood does not destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son will fall to the earth.

12. Then the woman said, Let your slave, I pray you, speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

13. And the woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished one.

14. For we must surely die, and are as water split on the ground, which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but he devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him.

15. Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your slave said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his slave.

16. For the king will hear, to deliver his slave out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.

17. Then your slave said, Let, I pray you, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Yahweh your God be with you.

18. Then the king answered and said to the woman, Don't hide from me, I pray you, anything that I will ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

19. And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your slave Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your slave;

20. to change the face of the matter has your slave Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

21. And the king said to Joab, Look now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.

22. And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, Today your slave knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has performed the request of his slave.

23. So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.

24. And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but don't let him see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and didn't see the king's face.

25. Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as good-looking as Absalom: from the sole of his foot even to the top of his head there was no blemish in him.

26. And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight.

27. And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a beautiful woman.

28. And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see the king's face.

29. Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.

30. Therefore he said to his slaves, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's slaves set the field on fire.

31. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your slaves set my field on fire?

32. And Absalom answered Joab, Look, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.

33. So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

## 2 Samuel 15

1. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

2. And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your slave is of one of the tribes of Israel.

3. And Absalom said to him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.

4. Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!

5. And it was so, that, when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.

6. And on this manner Absalom did to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

7. And it came to pass at the end of four years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.

8. For your slave vowed a vow while I remained at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Yahweh will indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.

9. And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.

10. But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you{+} hear the sound of the trumpet, then you{+} will say, Absalom is king in Hebron.

11. And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn't know anything.

12. And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.

13. And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.

14. And David said to all his slaves who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us will escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, or else he will overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.

15. And the king's slaves said to the king, Look, your slaves are ready to do whatever my lord the king will choose.

16. And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.

17. And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.

18. And all his slaves passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

19. Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why do you also go with us? Return, and remain with the king: for you are a foreigner, and also an exile; [return] to your own place.

20. Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers with you; and may Yahweh show you mercy and truth.

21. And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king will be, whether to death or to life, even there also will your slave be.

22. And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.

23. And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

24. And, look, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had finished passing out of the city.

25. And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I will find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:

26. but if he says thus, I have no delight in you; look, here I am, let him do to me as is good in his eyes.

27. The king said also to Zadok the priest, Do you see? Return into the city in peace, and your{+} two sons with you{+}, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

28. See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there comes word from you{+} to inform me.

29. Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they remained there.

30. And David went up by the ascent of the [mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

31. And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Yahweh, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

32. And it came to pass, that, when David came to the top [of the ascent], where God was worshiped, look, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth on his head.

33. And David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me:

34. but if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your slave, O king; as I have been your father's slave in time past, so I will now be your slave; then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.

35. And don't you have there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? Therefore it will be, that whatever thing you will hear out of the king's house, you will tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

36. Look, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you{+} will send to me everything that you{+} will hear.

37. So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 16

1. And when David was a little past the top [of the ascent], look, Ziba the attendant of Mephibaal met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and an ephah of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

2. And the king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.

3. And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Look, he remains at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.

4. Then the king said to Ziba, Look, all that pertains to Mephibaal is yours. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.

5. And when King David came to Bahurim, look, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.

6. And he cast stones at David, and at all the slaves of King David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.

7. And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, you man of blood, and base fellow:

8. Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and, look, you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a man of blood.

9. Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.

10. And the king said, What have I to do with you{+}, you{+} sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then will say, Why have you done so?

11. And David said to Abishai, and to all his slaves, Look, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? Let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has bidden him.

12. It may be that Yahweh will look at the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.

13. So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside across from him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.

14. And the king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.

15. And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

16. And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.

17. And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your companion? Why didn't you go with your companion?

18. And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, I will be his, and I will remain with him.

19. And again, whom should I serve? [Should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so I will be in your presence.

20. Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your{+} counsel what we will do.

21. And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father: then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.

22. So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

23. And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

## 2 Samuel 17

1. Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:

2. and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people who are with him will flee; and I will strike the king only;

3. and I will bring back all the people to you: all the people will return [if] the man you are seeking [is struck]: all the people will be in peace.

4. And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

5. Then Absalom said, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.

6. And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? If not, you speak.

7. And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.

8. Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

9. Look, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.

10. And even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will completely melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.

11. But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.

12. So we will come upon him in some place where he will be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one.

13. Moreover, if he goes into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.

14. And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Yahweh had determined to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.

15. Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus I have counseled.

16. Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; or else the king will be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.

17. Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by En-rogel; and a female slave used to go and tell them; and they went and told King David: so they might not be seen coming into the city.

18. But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.

19. And the woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain on it; and nothing was known.

20. And Absalom's slaves came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

21. And it came to pass, after they departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told King David; and they said to David, Arise{+}, and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you{+}.

22. Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that had not gone over the Jordan.

23. And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.

24. Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.

25. And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.

26. And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.

27. And it came to pass, when David came to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,

28. brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],

29. and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

## 2 Samuel 18

1. And David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.

2. And David divided the people in three [parts], a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you{+} myself also.

3. But the people said, You will not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you are ready to succor us out of the city.

4. And the king said to them, What seems best to you{+} I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.

5. And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

6. So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.

7. And the people of Israel were struck there before the slaves of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.

8. For the battle was spread there over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

9. And Absalom chanced to meet the slaves of David. And Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.

10. And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Look, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.

11. And Joab said to the man that told him, And, look, you saw it, and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? And I would have given you ten [pieces of] silver, and a belt.

12. And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand, yet I would not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Watch out for whoever is against the young man Absalom.

13. Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against [me].

14. Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

15. And ten young men who bore Joab's armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and slew him.

16. And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.

17. And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

18. Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this day.

19. Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me now run, and bear the king good news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.

20. And Joab said to him, You will not be the bearer of good news this day, but you will bear good news another day; but this day you will bear no good news, because the king's son is dead.

21. Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.

22. Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray you, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no good news to deliver?

23. But come what may, [he said], I will run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.

24. Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw a man running alone.

25. And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is good news in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

26. And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper, and said, Look, [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also brings good news.

27. And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.

28. And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

29. And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's slave and your slave, I saw a great tumult, but I didn't know what it was.

30. And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.

31. And, look, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, good news for my lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.

32. And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.

33. And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, he said thus, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!

## 2 Samuel 19

1. And it was told Joab, Look, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.

2. And the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, The king grieves for his son.

3. And the people went by stealth that day into the city, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

4. And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

5. And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your slaves, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;

6. in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and slaves are nothing to you: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all of us had died this day, then it would have pleased you well.

7. Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your slaves; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't go forth, there will not tarry a man with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.

8. Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Look, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.

9. And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.

10. And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don't you{+} speak a word of bringing the king back?

11. And King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you{+} the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king.

12. You{+} are my brothers, you{+} are my bone and my flesh: why then are you{+} the last to bring back the king?

13. And say{+} to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you are not captain of the host before me continually in the place of Joab.

14. And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent to the king, [saying], Return, you and all your slaves.

15. So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.

16. And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.

17. And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty slaves with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.

18. And there went over a ferryboat to bring over the king's household, and to do that which was good in his eyes. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he came over the Jordan.

19. And he said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me, neither remember that which your slave did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

20. For your slave knows that I have sinned: therefore, look, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

21. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Will not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?

22. And David said, What have I to do with you{+}, you{+} sons of Zeruiah, that you{+} should this day be adversaries to me? Will there be any man put to death this day in Israel? For don't I know that I am this day king over Israel?

23. And the king said to Shimei, You will not die. And the king swore to him.

24. And Mephibaal the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace to Jerusalem.

25. And it came to pass, when he came to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibaal?

26. And he answered, My lord, O king, my slave deceived me: for your slave said, I will saddle myself a donkey, that I may ride on it, and go with the king; because your slave is lame.

27. And he has slandered your slave to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.

28. For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your slave among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry anymore to the king?

29. And the king said to him, Why speak anymore of your matters? I say, You and Ziba divide the land.

30. And Mephibaal said to the king, yes, let him take all, since my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.

31. And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.

32. Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even 80 years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

33. And the king said to Barzillai, You come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.

34. And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?

35. I am this day 80 years old: can I discern between good and bad? Can your slave taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear anymore the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your slave be yet a burden to my lord the king?

36. Your slave would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?

37. Let your slave, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But look, your slave Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what will seem good to you.

38. And the king answered, Chimham will go over with me, and I will do to him that which will seem good to you: and whatever you will require of me, that I will do for you.

39. And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.

40. So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.

41. And, look, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?

42. And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then are you{+} angry for this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's cost? Or has he given us any gift?

43. And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right] in David than you{+}: why then did you{+} despise us, that our advice should not be had first in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

## 2 Samuel 20

1. And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.

2. So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah stuck to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.

3. And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but didn't go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.

4. Then the king said to Amasa, Call together for me the men of Judah three days, and be present here.

5. So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

6. And David said to Abishai, Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than did Absalom: you take your lord's slaves, and pursue after him, in case he found himself fortified cities, and tears out our eye.

7. And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

8. When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a belt with a sword fastened on his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.

9. And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.

10. But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his insides to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

11. And there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.

12. And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.

13. When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

14. And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maacah. And all those who joined him were gathered together, and also went after him.

15. And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

16. Then a wise woman cried out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you{+}, to Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you.

17. And he came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your slave. And he answered, I am listening.

18. Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in old time, saying, They will surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter].

19. I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?

20. And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.

21. The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Look, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.

22. Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.

23. Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;

24. and Adoram was over the men subject to slave labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;

25. and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;

26. and also Ira the Jairite was chief ruler to David.

## 2 Samuel 21

1. And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh. And Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.

2. And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the sons of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah);

3. and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you{+}? And how shall I make atonement, that you{+} may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?

4. And the Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What you{+} will say, that I will do for you{+}.

5. And they said to the king, The man who consumed us, and that devised against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,

6. let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh. And the king said, I will give them.

7. But the king spared Mephibaal, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

8. But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

9. And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell [all] seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.

10. And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from heaven; and she allowed neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

11. And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.

12. And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;

13. and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.

14. And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.

15. And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his slaves with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;

16. and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of bronze in weight, he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.

17. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You will not go out with us to battle anymore, that you do not quench the lamp of Israel.

18. And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.

19. And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jari the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

20. And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.

21. And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, slew him.

22. These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his slaves.

## 2 Samuel 22

1. And David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

2. and he said, Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;

3. God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My savior, you save me from violence.

4. I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So I will be saved from my enemies.

5. For the waves of death surrounded me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:

6. The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.

7. In my distress I called on Yahweh; Yes, I called to my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears.

8. Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was angry.

9. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.

10. He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.

11. And he rode on a cherub, and flew; Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.

12. And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

13. At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.

14. Yahweh thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.

15. And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.

16. Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.

17. He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;

18. He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.

19. They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Yahweh was my support.

20. He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.

21. Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.

22. For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.

23. For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.

24. I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from my iniquity.

25. Therefore Yahweh has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.

26. With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect;

27. With the pure you will show yourself pure; And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.

28. And the afflicted people you will save; But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.

29. For you are my lamp, O Yahweh; And Yahweh will lighten my darkness.

30. For by you I run on a troop; By my God I leap over a wall.

31. As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Yahweh is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.

32. For who is God, but Yahweh? And who is a rock, but our God?

33. God is my strong fortress; And he opened up perfectly my way.

34. He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], And sets me on my high places.

35. He teaches my hands to war, So that my arms bend a bow of bronze.

36. You have also given me the shield of your salvation; And your response has made me great.

37. You have enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.

38. I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again until they were consumed.

39. And I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can't arise: Yes, they have fallen under my feet.

40. For you have girded me with strength to the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.

41. You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, That I might cut off those who hate me.

42. They looked, but there was none to save; Even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them.

43. Then I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I crush them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.

44. You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people; You have kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known will serve me.

45. The foreigners will submit themselves to me: As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.

46. The foreigners will fade away, And will come trembling out of their close places.

47. Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,

48. Even the God who executes vengeance for me, And that brings down peoples under me,

49. And that brings me forth from my enemies: Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me; You deliver me from the violent man.

50. Therefore I will give thanks to you, O Yahweh, among the nations, And will sing praises to your name.

51. Great deliverance he gives to his king, And shows loving-kindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, forevermore.

## 2 Samuel 23

1. Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse says, And the [noble] man who was raised on high says, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel:

2. The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me, And his word was on my tongue.

3. The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: One who rules over man righteously, That rules in the fear of God,

4. [He will be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, A morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs] out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.

5. Truly my house is not so with God; Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, Ordered in all things, and sure: For it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire, Although he does not make it to grow.

6. But the ungodly will be all of them as thorns to be thrust away, Because they can't be taken with the hand

7. But the man who touches them Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear: And they will be completely burned with fire in [their] place.

8. These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Jishbaal the Hachmonite, [of] the elite troops; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.

9. And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.

10. He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword; and Yahweh wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.

11. And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.

12. But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Yahweh wrought a great victory.

13. And three of the elite troops went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

14. And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.

15. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!

16. And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.

17. And he said, Be it far from me, O Yahweh, that I should do this: [shall I drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.

18. And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was [of] the elite troops. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.

19. Was he not most honorable of the thirty? Therefore he was made their captain: nevertheless he didn't attain to the three.

20. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a man of valor of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.

21. And he slew a handsome Egyptian: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

22. These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.

23. He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain to the three. And David set him over his guard.

24. Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,

25. Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

26. Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

27. Abiezer the Anathothite, Sabeni the Hushathite,

28. Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

29. Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,

30. Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.

31. Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

32. Eliahba the Shaalbonite, Jashen the Gunite, Jonathan

33. the son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,

34. Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

35. Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

36. Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

37. Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,

38. Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

39. Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

## 2 Samuel 24

1. And again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.

2. And the king said to Joab, the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number{+} the people, that I may know the sum of the people.

3. And Joab said to the king, May Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?

4. Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.

5. And they passed over the Jordan, and began from Aroer and from the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:

6. then they came to Gilead, and to the land of the Hittites, to Kadesh; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,

7. and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.

8. So when they had gone to and from through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

9. And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

10. And David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Yahweh, put away, I urge you, the iniquity of your slave; for I have done very foolishly.

11. And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

12. Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose for yourself one of them, that I may do it to you.

13. So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Will seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or will there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now advise, and consider what answer I will return to him who sent me.

14. And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great; and don't let me fall into the hand of man.

15. So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.

16. And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now let down your hand. And the angel of Yahweh was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

17. And David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel that struck the people, and said, Look, I have sinned, and I, the shepherd, have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father's house.

18. And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Yahweh in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

19. And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.

20. And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his slaves coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.

21. And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his slave? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of you, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from the people.

22. And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up that which is good in his eyes: look, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:

23. all this, O king, does Araunah give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.

24. And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will truly buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

25. And David built an altar there to Yahweh, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stopped from Israel.
