# Habakkuk

## Habakkuk 1

1. The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.

2. O Yahweh, how long shall I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you of violence, and you will not save.

3. Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perverseness? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.

4. Therefore the law is slacked, and justice does never go forth; for the wicked circles about the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted.

5. Look{+} among the nations, and see{+}, and wonder{+} marvelously; for a work is working in your{+} days, which you{+} will not believe though it is told you{+}.

6. For, look, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that marches through the width of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.

7. They are terrible and awesome; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.

8. Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: and they ride from afar; they fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.

9. They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.

10. Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him; he derides every stronghold; for he heaps up dust, and takes it.

11. Then he will sweep by [as] a wind, and will pass over, and be guilty, [even] he whose might is his god.

12. Are not you from everlasting, O Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We will not die. O Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment; and you, O Rock, have established him for correction.

13. You who are of purer eyes than to look at evil, and who cannot look at perverseness, why do you look on betrayers, and hold your peace when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he;

14. and make man as the fish of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?

15. He takes up all of them with the angle, he catches them in his net, and gathers them in his drag: therefore he rejoices and is glad.

16. Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.

17. Will he therefore draw his sword, and not spare to slay the nations continually?

## Habakkuk 2

1. I will stand on my watch, and set myself on the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.

2. And Yahweh answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he may run that reads it.

3. For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and will not lie: though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.

4. Look, his soul is presumptuous, it is not upright in him; but the righteous will live by his faith.

5. And how much more arrogant is a betrayer, a haughty [able-bodied] man, that does not keep at home; who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and can't be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples.

6. Will not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him who increases that which is not his! How long? And that loads himself with pledges!

7. Will they not rise up suddenly that will bite you, and awake that will vex you, and you will be for booty to them?

8. Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of man's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.

9. Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!

10. You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.

11. For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber will answer it.

12. Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!

13. Look, is it not of Yahweh of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?

14. For the earth will be filled with knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.

15. Woe to him who gives his fellow man drink, mixing your strong wine, and make him drunk also, that you may look at their nakedness!

16. You are filled with shame, and not glory: you also drink, and show your foreskin; the cup of Yahweh's right hand will come round to you, and foul shame will be on your glory.

17. For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you, and the destruction of the beasts, which will frighten you; because of man's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.

18. What does it profit the graven image, that its maker has graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?

19. Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake; Arise! [And] to the mute stone, It will teach. Look, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

20. But Yahweh is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silent before him.

## Habakkuk 3

1. A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.

2. O Yahweh, I have heard the report of you, and am afraid: O Yahweh, revive your work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.

3. God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.

4. And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.

5. Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.

6. He stood, and measured the earth; He looked, and drove apart the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills bowed down; His goings were [as] of old.

7. I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.

8. Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers, Or your wrath against the sea, That you rode on your horses, On your chariots of salvation?

9. Your bow was bared naked; By means of a word the arrows are assigned by oath. Selah. You split the earth with rivers.

10. The mountains saw you, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.

11. The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of your arrows as they went, At the shining of your glittering spear.

12. You marched though the land in indignation; You threshed the nations in anger.

13. You went forth for the salvation of your people, For the salvation of your anointed; You wounded the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.

14. You pierced with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

15. You trod the sea with your horses, The heap of mighty waters.

16. I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invades us.

17. For though the fig-tree will not flourish, Neither will fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive will fail, And the fields will yield no food; The flock will be cut off from the fold, And there will be no herd in the stalls:

18. Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

19. Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength; And he makes my feet like hinds' [feet] And will make me to walk on my high places. For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.
