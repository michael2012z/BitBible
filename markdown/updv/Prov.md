## Proverbs 1

1. The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:

2. To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;

3. To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;

4. To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:

5. That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsels:

6. To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

7. The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.

8. My son, hear the instruction of your father, And don't forsake the law of your mother:

9. For they will be a chaplet of grace to your head, And chains about your neck.

10. My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.

11. If they say, Come with us, Let us lay in wait for blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;

12. Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those who go down into the pit;

13. We will find all precious substance; We will fill our houses with spoil;

14. You will cast your lot among us; We will all have one bag:

15. My son, don't walk in the way with them; Refrain your foot from their path:

16. []

17. For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:

18. And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk secretly for their own lives.

19. So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; It takes away the life of its owners.

20. Wisdom cries aloud in the street; She utters her voice in the broad places;

21. She cries in the most noisy places; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she utters her words:

22. How long, you{+} simple ones, will you{+} love simplicity? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn{+} at my reproof: Look, I will cause my spirit to gush out on you{+} I will make my words known to you{+}.

24. Because I have called, and you{+} have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man has regarded;

25. But you{+} have set at nothing all my counsel, And would have none of my reproof:

26. I also will laugh in [the day of] your{+} calamity; I will mock when your{+} fear comes;

27. When your{+} fear comes as a storm, And your{+} calamity comes on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you{+}.

28. Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me:

29. For they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Yahweh:

30. They didn't want my counsel; They despised all my reproof.

31. Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.

32. For the backsliding of the simple will slay them, And the careless ease of fools will destroy them.

33. But whoever harkens to me will stay securely, And will be quiet without fear of evil.

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if you will receive my words, And lay up my commandments with you;

2. So as to incline your ear to wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding;

3. Yes, if you cry after discernment, And lift up your voice for understanding;

4. If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures:

5. Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, And find knowledge of God.

6. For Yahweh gives wisdom; Out of his mouth [comes] knowledge and understanding:

7. He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; [He is] a shield to those who walk in integrity;

8. That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.

9. Then you will understand righteousness and justice, And equity, [yes], every good path.

10. For wisdom will enter into your heart, And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;

11. Discretion will watch over you; Understanding will keep you:

12. To deliver you from the way of evil, From the men who speak perverse things;

13. Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;

14. Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;

15. Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:

16. To deliver you from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;

17. That forsakes the best friend of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God:

18. For her house inclines to death, And her paths to the spirits of the dead;

19. None who go to her return again, Neither do they attain to the paths of life:

20. That you may walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.

21. For the upright will stay in the land, And the perfect will be left in it.

22. But the wicked will be cut off from the land, And betrayers will be rooted out of it.

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, do not forget my law; But let your heart keep my commandments:

2. For length of days, and years of life, And peace, they will add to you.

3. Don't let kindness and truth forsake you: Bind them about your neck;

4. So you will find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.

5. Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding:

6. In all your ways acknowledge him, And he will direct your paths.

7. Don't be wise in your own eyes; Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil:

8. It will be health to your navel, And marrow to your bones.

9. Honor Yahweh with your substance, And with the first fruits of all your increase:

10. So your barns will be filled with corn, And your vats will overflow with new wine.

11. My son, don't despise the chastening of Yahweh; Neither be weary of his reproof:

12. For whom Yahweh loves he reproves; Even as a father the son in whom he delights.

13. Happy is [the] man who finds wisdom, And [the] man who gets understanding.

14. For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And its profit than fine gold.

15. She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.

18. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold on her: And happy is everyone who retains her.

19. Yahweh by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.

20. By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.

21. My son, don't let them depart from your eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:

22. So they will be life to your soul, And grace to your neck.

23. Then you will walk in your way securely, And your foot will not stumble.

24. When you lie down, you will not be afraid: Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.

25. Don't be afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:

26. For Yahweh will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being taken.

27. Don't withhold good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do it.

28. Don't say to your fellow man, Go, and come again, And tomorrow I will give; When you have it by you.

29. Don't devise evil against your fellow man Who dwells securely by you.

30. Don't strive with man without cause, If he has done you no harm.

31. Don't envy the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.

32. For the perverse is disgusting to Yahweh; But his friendship is with the upright.

33. The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked; But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.

34. Surely he scoffs at the scoffers; But he gives grace to the lowly.

35. The wise will inherit glory; But shame will be the promotion of fools.

## Proverbs 4

1. Hear, [my] sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:

2. For I give you{+} good doctrine; Don't forsake{+} my law.

3. For I was a son to my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.

4. And he taught me, and said to me: Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;

5. Get wisdom, get understanding; Don't forget, neither decline from the words of my mouth;

6. Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you.

7. Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [therefore] get wisdom; Yes, with all your getting get understanding.

8. Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.

9. She will give to your head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty she will deliver to you.

10. Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of your life will be many.

11. I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in paths of uprightness.

12. When you go, your steps will not be straitened; And if you run, you will not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of instruction; don't let her go: Keep her; for she is your life.

14. Don't enter into the path of the wicked, And don't walk in the way of evil men.

15. Avoid it, don't pass by it; Turn from it, and pass on.

16. For they don't sleep, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shines more and more to the perfect day.

19. The way of the wicked is as darkness: They don't know at what they stumble.

20. My son, attend to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.

21. Don't let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart.

22. For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.

23. Keep your heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.

24. Put away from you a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from you.

25. Let your eyes look right on, And let your eyelids look straight before you.

26. Make level the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established.

27. Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left: Remove your foot from evil.

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, attend to my wisdom; Incline your ear to my understanding:

2. That you may preserve discretion, And that your lips may keep knowledge.

3. For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:

4. But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;

6. If she does not find the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, [and] she will not know.

7. Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me, And do not depart from the words of my mouth.

8. Remove your way far from her, And don't come near the door of her house;

9. Or else you will give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel;

10. Or else strangers will be filled with your strength, And your labors [be] in the house of an alien,

11. And you mourn at your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,

12. And say, How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;

13. Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!

14. I was well-near in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.

15. Drink waters out of your own cistern, And running waters out of your own well.

16. Should your springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?

17. Let them be for yourself alone, And not for strangers with you.

18. Let your fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of your youth.

19. [As] a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her nipples immerse you at all times; And be ravished always with her love.

20. For why should you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh; And he makes level all his paths.

22. His own iniquities will take the wicked, And he will be held with the cords of his sin.

23. He will die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if you have become surety for your fellow man, If you have stricken your hands for a stranger;

2. You are snared with the words of your mouth, You are taken with the words of your mouth.

3. Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, Seeing you have come into the hand of your fellow man: Go, humble yourself, and importune your fellow man;

4. Don't give sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids;

5. Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, you sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:

7. Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,

8. Provides her bread in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest.

9. How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?

10. [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:

11. So will your poverty come as a robber, And your want as an armed man.

12. [A] worthless man, a man of iniquity, Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;

13. That winks with his eyes, that speaks with his feet, That makes signs with his fingers;

14. In whose heart is perverseness, Who devises evil continually, Who sows discord.

15. Therefore will his calamity come suddenly; All of a sudden he will be broken, and that without remedy.

16. There are six things which Yahweh hates; Yes, seven which are disgusting to him:

17. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;

18. A heart that devises wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,

19. A false witness that utters lies, And he who sows discord among brothers.

20. My son, keep the commandment of your father, And don't forsake the law of your mother:

21. Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them about your neck.

22. When you walk, it will lead you; When you sleep, it will watch over you; And when you awake, it will talk with you.

23. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is a light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

24. To keep you from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner's tongue.

25. Don't lust after her beauty in your heart; Neither let her take you with her eyelids.

26. For on account of a prostitute [a man is brought] to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunts for the precious life.

27. Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?

28. Or can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?

29. So he who goes in to his fellow man's wife; Whoever has any sex with her will not be unpunished.

30. Men do not despise a thief, if he steals To satisfy himself when he is hungry:

31. But if he is found, he will restore sevenfold; He will give all the substance of his house.

32. He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He who does it destroys his own soul.

33. Wounds and dishonor he will get; And his reproach will not be wiped away.

34. For jealousy is the rage of a [noble] man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

35. He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with you.

2. Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of your eye.

3. Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.

4. Say to wisdom, You are my sister; And call understanding [your] kinswoman:

5. That they may keep you from the strange woman, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.

6. For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;

7. And I saw among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,

8. Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,

9. In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.

10. And, look, there met him a woman With the attire of a prostitute, and wily of heart.

11. She is clamorous and willful; Her feet do not stay in her house:

12. Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lies in wait at every corner.

13. So she caught him, and kissed him, [And] with an impudent face she said to him:

14. Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day I have paid my vows.

15. Therefore I came forth to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.

16. I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.

17. I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.

19. For the man is not at home; He has gone on a long journey:

20. He has taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.

21. With her much fair speech she causes him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forces him along.

22. He goes after her right away, As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as [one in] fetters to the correction of the fool;

23. Until an arrow strikes through his liver; As a bird hurries to the snare, And does not know that it is for his life.

24. Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me, And attend to the words of my mouth.

25. Don't let your heart decline to her ways; Don't go astray in her paths.

26. For she has cast down many wounded: Yes, all her slain are a mighty host.

27. Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.

## Proverbs 8

1. Does not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?

2. On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she stands;

3. Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she cries aloud:

4. To you{+}, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of man.

5. O you{+} simple, understand prudence; And, you{+} fools, be of an understanding heart.

6. Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips will be right things.

7. For my mouth will utter truth; And wickedness is disgusting to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.

9. They are all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.

12. I, wisdom, stay with prudence, And find out knowledge [and] discretion.

13. The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, I hate.

14. Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.

15. By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.

16. By me princes rule, And nobles, [even] all those who govern righteously.

17. I love those who love me; And those who seek me diligently will find me.

18. Riches and honor are with me; [Yes], durable wealth and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.

20. I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;

21. That I may cause those who love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.

22. Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.

23. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.

24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.

25. Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills I was brought forth;

26. While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.

27. When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle on the face of the deep,

28. When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,

29. When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;

30. Then I was by him, [as] a master craftsman; And I was daily [his] delight, Rejoicing always before him,

31. Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of man.

32. Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me; For blessed are those who keep my ways.

33. Hear instruction, and be wise, And don't refuse it.

34. Blessed is [the] man who hears me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.

35. For whoever finds me finds life, And will obtain favor of Yahweh.

36. But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul: All those who hate me love death.

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom has built her house; She has cut out her seven pillars:

2. She has killed her beasts; She has mingled her wine; She has also furnished her table:

3. She has sent forth her maidens; She cries on the highest places of the city:

4. Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,

5. Come, eat{+} of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.

6. Leave off, you{+} simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.

7. He who corrects a scoffer gets to himself reviling; And he who reproves a wicked man [gets] himself a blot.

8. Don't reprove a scoffer, or else he will hate you: Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.

9. Give [instruction] to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.

10. The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; And knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

11. For by me your days will be multiplied, And the years of your life will be increased.

12. If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; And if you scoff, you alone will bear it.

13. The foolish woman is clamorous; [She is] simple, and knows nothing.

14. And she sits at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,

15. To call to those who pass by, Who go right on their ways:

16. Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; And as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,

17. Stolen waters are sweet, And bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.

18. But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

32. If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, Or if you have thought evil, [Lay] your hand on your mouth.

30. Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; [But] a woman who fears Yahweh, she will be praised.

31. Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates.
