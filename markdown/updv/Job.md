# Job

## Job 1

1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.

2. And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.

3. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the sons of the east.

4. And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.

5. And it was so, when the days of their feasting had gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus Job did continually.

6. Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.

7. And Yahweh said to Satan, Where do you come from? Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

8. And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my slave Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.

9. Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?

10. Haven't you made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance has increased in the land.

11. But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.

12. And Yahweh said to Satan, Look, all that he has is in your power; only on him do not put forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.

13. And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,

14. that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys pasturing beside them;

15. and the Sabeans fell [on them], and took them away: yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.

16. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.

17. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.

18. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;

19. and, look, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.

20. Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped;

21. and he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I will return there: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away; blessed be the name of Yahweh.

22. In all this Job did not sin, nor charge God foolishly.

## Job 2

1. Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.

2. And Yahweh said to Satan, Where do you come from? And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

3. And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my slave Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil: and he still holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.

4. And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.

5. But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.

6. And Yahweh said to Satan, Look, he is in your hand; only spare his life.

7. So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with intense boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.

8. And he took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with it; and he sat among the ashes.

9. Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Renounce God, and die.

10. But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.

11. Now when Job's three companions heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.

12. And when they lifted up their eyes far off, and didn't know him, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.

13. So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.

## Job 3

1. After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

2. And Job answered and said:

3. Let the day perish in which I was born, And the night which said, A [noble] man was conceived.

4. Let that day be darkness; Don't let God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine on it.

5. Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud stay on it; Let all that makes blackness of day terrify it.

6. As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it: Don't let it rejoice among the days of the year; Don't let it come into the number of the months.

7. Look, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come in it.

8. Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.

9. Let the stars of its twilight be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it see the eyelids of the morning:

10. Because it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, Nor hid trouble from my eyes.

11. Why didn't I die from the womb? Why didn't I give up the ghost when my mother bore me?

12. Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should be nursed?

13. For now I should have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then I would have been at rest,

14. With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;

15. Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:

16. Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.

17. There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.

18. There the prisoners are at ease together; They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster.

19. The small and the great are there: And the slave is free from his master.

20. Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter in soul?

21. Who long for death, but it does not come, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;

22. Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave

23. To a [noble] man whose way is hid, And whom God has hedged in.

24. For my sighing comes before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.

25. For the thing which I fear comes on me, And that which I am afraid of comes to me.

26. I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble comes.

## Job 4

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,

2. If one assay to commune with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?

3. Look, you have instructed many, And you have strengthened the weak hands.

4. Your words have upheld him who was falling, And you have made firm the feeble knees.

5. But now it has come to you, and you faint; It touches you, and you are troubled.

6. Isn't your fear [of God] your confidence, [And] the integrity of your ways your hope?

7. Remember, I pray you, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?

8. According to as I have seen, those who plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.

9. By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.

10. The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

11. The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.

12. Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it.

13. In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,

14. Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.

15. Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.

16. It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice [saying],

17. Will common man be more just than God? Will [noble] man be more pure than his Maker?

18. Look, he puts no trust in his slaves; And his angels he charges with folly:

19. How much more those who stay in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!

20. Between morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish forever without any regarding it.

21. Isn't their tent-cord plucked up inside them? They die, and that without wisdom.

## Job 5

1. Call now; is there any who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?

2. For vexation kills the foolish man, And jealousy slays the silly one.

3. I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.

4. His sons are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:

5. Whose harvest the hungry eats up, And takes it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapes for their substance.

6. For affliction does not come forth from the dust, Neither does trouble spring out of the ground;

7. But man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward.

8. But as for me, I would seek to God, And to God I would commit my cause;

9. Who does great things and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number:

10. Who gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields;

11. So that he sets up on high those who are low, And those who mourn are exalted to safety.

12. He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can't perform their enterprise.

13. He takes the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.

14. They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noonday as in the night.

15. But he saves from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.

16. So the poor has hope, And iniquity stops her mouth.

17. Look, happy is [the] common man whom God corrects: Therefore don't despise the chastening of the Almighty.

18. For he makes sore, and binds up; He wounds, and his hands make whole.

19. He will deliver you in six troubles; Yes, in seven no evil will touch you.

20. In famine he will redeem you from death; And in war from the power of the sword.

21. You will be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.

22. At destruction and famine you will laugh; Neither will you be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

23. For you will be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.

24. And you will know that your tent is in peace; And you will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.

25. You will know also that your seed will be great, And your offspring as the grass of the earth.

26. You will come to your grave in a full age, Like a shock of grain comes in in its season.

27. See this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know it for your good.

## Job 6

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!

3. For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore my words have been rash.

4. For the arrows of the Almighty are inside me, The poison of which my spirit drinks up: The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.

5. Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?

6. Can that which has no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

7. My soul refuses to touch [them]; They are as loathsome food to me.

8. Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!

9. Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

10. And be it still my consolation, Yes, let me exult in pain that does not spare, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.

11. What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?

12. Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of bronze?

13. Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?

14. To him who is ready to faint kindness [should be shown] from his friend; Even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.

15. My brothers have betrayed as a wadi, As a channel of wadis, they pass away;

16. Which are black by reason of the ice, [And] in which the snow hides itself:

17. What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

18. The caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.

19. The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.

20. They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came there, and were confounded.

21. For now you{+} are nothing; You{+} see a terror, and are afraid.

22. Did I say, Give to me? Or, Offer a present for me of your{+} substance?

23. Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?

24. Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand in what I have erred.

25. How forcible are words of uprightness! But your{+} reproof, what does it reprove?

26. Do you{+} think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?

27. Yes, you{+} would cast [lots] on the fatherless, And make merchandise of your{+} companion.

28. Now therefore be pleased to look at me; For surely I will not lie to your{+} face.

29. Return, I pray you{+}, let there be no injustice; Yes, return again, my cause is righteous.

30. Is there injustice on my tongue? Can't my taste discern mischievous things?

## Job 7

1. Is there not a warfare to common man on earth? And are not his days like the days of a hired worker?

2. As a slave who earnestly desires the shadow, And as a hired worker that looks for his wages:

3. So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.

4. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.

5. My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.

6. My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope.

7. Oh remember that my life is a breath: My eye will no more see good.

8. The eye of him who sees me will look at me no more; Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.

9. As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, So he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more.

10. He will return no more to his house, Neither will his place know him anymore.

11. Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

12. Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That you set a watch over me?

13. When I say, My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint;

14. Then you scare me with dreams, And terrify me through visions:

15. So that my soul chooses strangling, And death rather than my bones.

16. I loathe [my life]; I would not live always: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.

17. What is common man, that you should magnify him, And that you should set your mind on him,

18. And that you should visit him every morning, And try him every moment?

19. How long will you not look away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow down my spittle?

20. If I have sinned, what do I do to you, O you watcher of man? Why have you set me as a mark for you, So that I am a burden to you?

21. And why don't you pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And you will seek me diligently, but I will not be.

## Job 8

1. Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,

2. How long will you speak these things? And [how long] will the words of your mouth be [like] a mighty wind?

3. Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

4. If your sons have sinned against him, And he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression;

5. If you would seek diligently to God, And make your supplication to the Almighty;

6. If you were pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for you, And make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.

7. And though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would greatly increase.

8. For inquire, I pray you, of the former age, And apply yourself to that which their fathers have searched out:

9. (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days on earth are a shadow);

10. Will not they teach you, and tell you, And utter words out of their heart?

11. Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water?

12. While it is yet in its greenness, [and] not cut down, It withers before any [other] herb.

13. So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the godless man will perish:

14. Whose confidence will break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider's web.

15. He will lean on his house, but it will not stand: He will hold it fast, but it will not endure.

16. He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.

17. His roots are wrapped about the [stone]-heap, He looks at the place of stones.

18. If he is destroyed from his place, Then it will deny him, [saying], I haven't seen you.

19. Look, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth will others spring.

20. Look, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evildoers.

21. He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, And your lips with shouting.

22. Those who hate you will be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked will be no more.

## Job 9

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can common man be just with God?

3. If he is pleased to contend with him, He can't answer him one of a thousand.

4. [He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?-

5. [Him] that removes the mountains, and they do not know it, When he overturns them in his anger;

6. That shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;

7. That commands the sun, and it does not rise, And seals up the stars;

8. That alone stretches out the heavens, And treads on the waves of the sea;

9. That makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;

10. That does great things past finding out, Yes, marvelous things without number.

11. Look, he goes by me, and I don't see him: He passes on also, but I don't perceive him.

12. Look, he seizes [the prey], who can hinder him? Who will say to him, What are you doing?

13. God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.

14. How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words [to reason] with him?

15. Whom, though I were righteous, yet I would not answer; I would plead for mercy to my judge.

16. If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet I would not believe that he listened to my voice.

17. For he breaks me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause.

18. He will not allow me to take my breath, But fills me with bitterness.

19. If [we speak] of strength, look, [he is] mighty! And if of justice, Who, [he says], will summon me?

20. Though I be righteous, my own mouth will condemn me: Though I be perfect, it will prove me perverse.

21. I am perfect; I do not regard myself; I despise my life.

22. It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.

23. If the scourge slays suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.

24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges: If [it is] not [he], then who is it?

25. Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good,

26. They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoops on the prey.

27. If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my [sad] countenance, and be of good cheer;

28. I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.

29. I will be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?

30. If I wash myself with snow, And clean my my hands with lye;

31. Yet you will plunge me in the ditch, And my own clothes will be disgusted with me.

32. For he is not a man as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.

33. If only there were an umpire between us That might lay his hand on us both,

34. [Then] he would take his rod away from me, And his terror would not make me afraid.

35. Then I would speak and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.

## Job 10

1. My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

2. I will say to God, Do not condemn me; Show me why you contend with me.

3. Is it good to you that you should oppress, That you should despise the work of your hands, And shine on the counsel of the wicked?

4. Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as common man sees?

5. Are your days as the days of common man, Or your years as the days of [noble] man,

6. That you inquire after my iniquity, And search after my sin,

7. Although you know that I am not wicked, And there is none who can deliver out of your hand?

8. Your hands have framed me and fashioned me, Together round about; yet you destroy me.

9. Remember, I urge you, that you have fashioned me as clay; And will you bring me into dust again?

10. Have you not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?

11. You have clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.

12. You have granted me life and loving-kindness; And your visitation has preserved my spirit.

13. Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this is with you:

14. If I sin, then you mark me, And you will not acquit me from my iniquity.

15. If I am wicked, woe to me; And if I am righteous, yet I will not lift up my head, Filled with shame and drunk with my affliction.

16. And if [my head] exalts itself, you hunt me as a lion; And again you show yourself marvelous on me.

17. You renew your witnesses against me, And increase your indignation on me: Changes and warfare are with me.

18. Why then have you brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.

19. I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

20. Are not my days few? stop. Turn away from me, that I may take comfort a little,

21. Before I go from where I will not return, [Even] to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;

22. The land dark as midnight, [The land] of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight.

## Job 11

1. Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,

2. Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?

3. Should your boastings make men hold their peace? And when you mock, will no man make you ashamed?

4. For you say, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in your eyes.

5. But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against you,

6. And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.

7. Can you by searching find out God? Can you find out the Almighty to perfection?

8. At the height of heaven, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?

9. The measure of it is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.

10. If he passes through, and shuts up, And calls to judgment, then who can hinder him?

11. For he knows false men: He sees iniquity also, even though he does not consider it.

12. But a vain man is void of understanding, Yes, man is born [as] a wild donkey's colt.

13. If you set your heart aright, And stretch out your hands toward him;

14. If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And don't let unrighteousness stay in your tents.

15. Surely then you will lift up your face without spot; Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear:

16. For you will forget your misery; You will remember it as waters that are passed away,

17. And [your] lifetime will be clearer than the noonday; Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning.

18. And you will be secure, because there is hope; Yes, you will search [about you], and will take your rest in safety.

19. Also you will lie down, and none will make you afraid; Yes, many will make suit to you.

20. But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they will have no way to flee; And their hope will be the giving up of the ghost.

## Job 12

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. No doubt but you{+} are the people, And wisdom will die with you{+}.

3. But I have understanding as well as you{+}; I am not inferior to you{+}: Yes, who doesn't know such things as these?

4. I am as one who is a laughingstock to his fellow man, I who called on God, and he answered: The just, the perfect man is a laughingstock.

5. In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; It is ready for them whose foot slips.

6. The tents of robbers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure; Into whose hand God brings [abundantly].

7. But ask now the beasts, and they will teach you; And the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you:

8. Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; And the fish of the sea will declare to you.

9. Who doesn't know in all these, That the hand of Yahweh has wrought this,

10. In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?

11. Does not the ear try words, Even as the palate tastes its food?

12. With aged men is wisdom, And in length of days understanding.

13. With [God] is wisdom and might; He has counsel and understanding.

14. Look, he breaks down, and it can't be built again; He shuts up a man, and there can be no opening.

15. Look, he withholds the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.

16. With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his.

17. He leads counselors away stripped, And judges he makes fools.

18. He looses the authority of kings, And he binds their loins with a belt.

19. He leads priests away stripped, And overthrows the mighty.

20. He removes the speech of the trusty, And takes away the understanding of the elders.

21. He pours contempt on princes, And looses the belt of the strong.

22. He uncovers deep things out of darkness, And brings out to light the shadow of death.

23. He increases the nations, and he destroys them: He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.

24. He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

25. They grope in the dark without light; And he makes them to stagger like a drunk man.

## Job 13

1. Look, my eye has seen all [this], My ear has heard and understood it.

2. What you{+} know, [the same] do I know also: I am not inferior to you{+}.

3. Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.

4. But you{+} are forgers of lies; You{+} are all physicians of no value.

5. Oh that you{+} would altogether hold your{+} peace! And it would be your{+} wisdom.

6. Hear now my reasoning, And listen to the pleadings of my lips.

7. Will you{+} speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?

8. Will you{+} show partiality to him? Will you{+} contend for God?

9. Is it good that he should search you{+} out? Or as one deceives common man, will you{+} deceive him?

10. He will surely reprove you{+}, If you{+} secretly show partiality.

11. Will not his majesty make you{+} afraid, And his dread fall on you{+}?

12. Your{+} memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your{+} defenses are defenses of clay.

13. Hold your{+} peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come upon me what will.

14. Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?

15. Look, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.

16. This also will be my salvation, That a godless man will not come before him.

17. Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your{+} ears.

18. Look now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.

19. Who is he that will contend with me? For then I would hold my peace and give up the ghost.

20. Only don't do two things to me; Then I will not hide myself from your face:

21. Withdraw your hand far from me; And don't let your terror make me afraid.

22. Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer me.

23. How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.

24. Why do you hide your face, And hold me for your enemy?

25. Will you harass a driven leaf? And will you pursue the dry stubble?

26. For you write bitter things against me, And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:

27. You put my feet also in the stocks, And mark all my paths; You set a bound to the soles of my feet:

28. Though I am like a rotten thing that consumes, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.

## Job 14

1. Man, who is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.

2. He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: He flees also as a shadow, and does not continue.

3. And do you open your eyes on such a one, And bring me into judgment with you?

4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.

5. Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with you, And you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass;

6. Look away from him, that he may rest, Until he will accomplish, as a hired worker, his day.

7. For there is hope of a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And that its tender branch will not cease.

8. Though its root waxes old in the earth, And its stock dies in the ground;

9. Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.

10. But [noble] man dies, and is laid low: Yes, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?

11. [As] the waters fail from the sea, And the river wastes and dries up;

12. So man lies down and does not rise: Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.

13. Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, That you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, That you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!

14. If a [noble] man die, will he live [again]? All the days of my warfare I would wait, Until my release should come.

15. You would call, and I would answer you: You would have a desire to the work of your hands.

16. But now you number my steps: Don't you watch over my sin?

17. My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And you fasten up my iniquity.

18. But the mountain falling comes to nothing; And the rock is removed out of its place;

19. The waters wear the stones; The overflowings of it wash away the dust of the earth: So you destroy the hope of common man.

20. You prevail forever against him, and he passes; You change his countenance, and send him away.

21. His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; And they are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them.

22. But his flesh on him has pain, And his soul inside him mourns.

## Job 15

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

2. Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?

3. Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches by which he can do no good?

4. Yes, you do away with fear, And hinder devotion before God.

5. For your iniquity teaches your mouth, And you choose the tongue of the crafty.

6. Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; Yes, your own lips testify against you.

7. Are you the first of man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?

8. Have you heard the secret counsel of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?

9. What do you know, that we don't know? What do you understand, which is not in us?

10. With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much older than your father.

11. Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word that is gentle toward you?

12. Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash,

13. That against God you turn your spirit, And let words go out of your mouth?

14. What is common man, that he should be clean? And he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

15. Look, he puts no trust in his holy ones; Yes, the heavens are not clean in his eyes:

16. How much less one who is disgusting and corrupt, A man who drinks iniquity like water!

17. I will show you, hear me; And that which I have seen I will declare:

18. (Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;

19. To whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):

20. The wicked man travails with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.

21. A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer will come upon him.

22. He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, And he is destined for the sword.

23. He is destined for bread, as bread for vultures. He knows that he is ready for destruction.

24. The day of darkness terrifies him, distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

25. Because he has stretched out his hand against God, And behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;

26. He runs on him with a [stiff] neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;

27. Because he has covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat on his loins;

28. And he has stayed in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;

29. He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, Neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.

30. He will not depart out of darkness; The flame will dry up his branches, And by the breath of [God's] mouth he will go away.

31. Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity will be his recompense.

32. It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green.

33. He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And will cast off his flower as the olive-tree.

34. For the company of the godless will be barren, And fire will consume the tents of bribery.

35. They are pregnant with mischief, and give birth to iniquity, And their heart prepares deceit.

## Job 16

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are all of you{+}.

3. Will vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?

4. I also could speak as you{+} do; If your{+} soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you{+}, And shake my head at you{+}.

5. [But] I would strengthen you{+} with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage [your{+} grief].

6. Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?

7. But now he has made me weary: You have made desolate all my company.

8. And you have shriveled me up, [which] is a witness [against me]: And my leanness rises up against me, It testifies to my face.

9. He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He has gnashed on me with his teeth: My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.

10. They have gaped on me with their mouth; They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.

11. God delivers me to the ungodly, And casts me into the hands of the wicked.

12. I was at ease, and he broke me apart; Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He has also set me up for his mark.

13. His archers circle me round about; He splits my reins apart, and does not spare; He pours out my gall on the ground.

14. He breaks me with breach on breach; He runs on me like a giant.

15. I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.

16. My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;

17. Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.

18. O earth, do not cover my blood, And let my cry have no [resting]-place.

19. Even now, look, my witness is in heaven, And he who vouches for me is on high.

20. My companions scoff at me: [But] my eye pours out tears to God,

21. That he would maintain the right of a [noble] man with God, And of a son of man with his fellow man!

22. For when a few years have come, I will go the way from where I will not return.

## Job 17

1. My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, Graves are [ready] for me.

2. Surely there are mockers with me, And my eye dwells on their provocation.

3. Give now a pledge, be surety for me with yourself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?

4. For you have hid their heart from understanding: Therefore you will not exalt [them].

5. He who denounces his companions for a prey, Even the eyes of his sons will fail.

6. But he has made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.

7. My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.

8. Upright men will be astonished at this, And the innocent will stir himself up against the godless.

9. Yet will the righteous hold on his way, And he who has clean hands will wax stronger and stronger.

10. But as for all of you{+}, come on now again; And I will not find a wise man among you{+}.

11. My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.

12. They change the night into day: The light, [say they], is near to the darkness.

13. If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;

14. If I have said to corruption, You are my father; To the worm, [You are] my mother, and my sister;

15. Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who will see it?

16. You will go down with me to Sheol. Shall we not go down together to the dust?

## Job 18

1. Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,

2. How long will you{+} hunt for words? Consider, and afterward we will speak.

3. Why are we counted as beasts, [And] have we become unclean in your{+} sight?

4. You who tear yourself in your anger, Will the earth be forsaken for you? Or will the rock be removed out of its place?

5. Yes, the light of the wicked will be put out, And the spark of his fire will not shine.

6. The light will be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him will be put out.

7. The steps of his strength will be straitened, And his own counsel will cast him down.

8. For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walks on the toils.

9. A trap will take [him] by the heel, [And] a snare will lay hold on him.

10. A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.

11. Terrors will make him afraid on every side, And will chase him at his heels.

12. His strength will be hunger-bitten, And calamity will be ready at his side.

13. The members of his body will be devoured, [Yes], the firstborn of death will devour his members.

14. He will be rooted out of his tent where he trusts; And he will be brought to the king of terrors.

15. There will stay in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone will be scattered on his habitation.

16. His roots will be dried up beneath, And above will his branch be cut off.

17. His remembrance will perish from the earth, And he will have no name in the street.

18. He will be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.

19. He will have neither son nor son's son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned.

20. Those who come after will be astonished at his day, As those who went before were frightened.

21. Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him who doesn't know God.

## Job 19

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. How long will you{+} vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?

3. These ten times you{+} have reproached me: You{+} are not ashamed that you{+} deal harshly with me.

4. And if indeed I have erred, My error remains with myself.

5. If indeed you{+} will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;

6. Know now that God has subverted me [in my cause], And has surrounded me with his net.

7. Look, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice.

8. He has walled up my way that I can't pass, And has set darkness in my paths.

9. He has stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.

10. He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope he has plucked up like a tree.

11. He has also kindled his wrath against me, And he counts me to him as [one of] his adversaries.

12. His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent.

13. He has put my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.

14. My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me.

15. Those who dwell in my house, and my female slaves, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.

16. I call to my slave, and he gives me no answer, [Though] I plead to him with my mouth.

17. My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the sons of my own mother.

18. Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me.

19. All my familiar friends are disgusted by me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.

20. My bone sticks to my skin and to my flesh, And I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.

21. Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you{+} my companions; For the hand of God has touched me.

22. Why do you{+} persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?

23. Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!

24. That with an iron pen and lead They were engraved in the rock forever!

25. But as for me I know that my Redeemer lives, And at last he will stand up on the earth:

26. And after my skin, [even] this [body], is destroyed, Then without my flesh will I see God;

27. Whom I, even I, will see, on my side, And my eyes will behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed inside me.

28. If you{+} say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;

29. Be{+} afraid of the sword: For wrath [brings] the punishments of the sword, That you{+} may know there is a judgment.

## Job 20

1. Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,

2. Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.

3. I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answers me.

4. Do you [not] know this of old time, Since man was placed on earth,

5. That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?

6. Though his height mounts up to the heavens, And his head reaches to the clouds;

7. Yet he will perish forever like his own dung: Those who have seen him will say, Where is he?

8. He will fly away as a dream, and will not be found: Yes, he will be chased away as a vision of the night.

9. The eye which saw him will see him no more; Neither will his place anymore look at him.

10. His sons will seek the favor of the poor, And his hands will give back his wealth.

11. His bones are full of his youth, But it will lie down with him in the dust.

12. Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, Though he hides it under his tongue,

13. Though he spares it, and will not let it go, But keeps it still inside his mouth;

14. Yet his food in his insides is turned, It is the gall of cobras inside him.

15. He has swallowed down riches, and he will vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.

16. He will suck the poison of cobras: The viper's tongue will slay him.

17. He will not look at the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.

18. That which he labored for he will restore, and will not swallow it down; According to the substance that he has gotten, he will not rejoice.

19. For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; He has violently taken away a house, and he will not build it up.

20. Because he knew no quietness inside him, He will not save anything of that in which he delights.

21. There was nothing left that he didn't devour; Therefore his prosperity will not endure.

22. In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in straits: The hand of everyone who is in misery will come upon him.

23. When he is about to fill his belly, [God] will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him, And will rain it on him while he is eating.

24. He will flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of bronze will strike him through.

25. He draws it forth, and it comes out of his back; Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall: Terrors are on him.

26. All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown [by man] will devour him; It will consume that which is left in his tent.

27. The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him.

28. The increase of his house will depart; [His goods] will flow away in the day of his wrath.

29. This is the portion of [the] wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed to him by God.

## Job 21

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your{+} consolations.

3. Allow me, and I also will speak; And after I have spoken, mock on.

4. As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?

5. Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your{+} hand on your{+} mouth.

6. Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror takes hold on my flesh.

7. Why do the wicked live, Become old, yes, wax mighty in power?

8. Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.

9. Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God on them.

10. Their bull genders, and does not fail; Their cow calves, and does not cast her calf.

11. They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.

12. They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.

13. They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.

14. And they say to God, Depart from us; For we do not desire knowledge of your ways.

15. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray to him?

16. Look, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

17. How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes on them? That [God] distributes sorrows in his anger?

18. That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carries away?

19. [You{+} say], God lays up his iniquity for his sons. Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it:

20. Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

21. For what does he care for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?

22. Will any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judges those who are high?

23. One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:

24. His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.

25. And another dies in bitterness of soul, And never tastes of good.

26. They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covers them.

27. Look, I know your{+} thoughts, And the devices with which you{+} would wrong me.

28. For you{+} say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent in which the wicked dwelt?

29. Have you{+} not asked wayfaring men? And don't you{+} know their evidences,

30. That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?

31. Who will declare his way to his face? And who will repay him what he has done?

32. Yet he will be borne to the grave, And men will keep watch over the tomb.

33. The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, And all of man will draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.

34. How then do you{+} comfort me in vain, Seeing in your{+} answers there remains [only] falsehood?

## Job 22

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

2. Can a [noble] man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.

3. Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? Or is it gain [to him], that you make your ways perfect?

4. Is it for your fear [of him] that he reproves you, That he enters with you into judgment?

5. Isn't your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.

6. For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing, And stripped the naked of their clothing.

7. You haven't given water to the weary to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry.

8. But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.

9. You have sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.

10. Therefore snares are round about you, And sudden fear troubles you,

11. Or darkness, so that you can't see, And abundance of waters cover you.

12. Isn't God in the height of heaven? And look at the height of the stars, how high they are!

13. And you say, What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?

14. Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he does not see; And he walks on the vault of heaven.

15. Will you keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?

16. Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,

17. Who said to God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?

18. Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

19. The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,

20. [Saying], Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire has consumed.

21. Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: By this good will come to you.

22. Receive, I pray you, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in your heart.

23. If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up, If you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.

24. And lay [your] treasure in the dust, And [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the brooks;

25. And the Almighty will be your treasure, And precious silver to you.

26. For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, And will lift up your face to God.

27. You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you; And you will pay your vows.

28. You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you; And light will shine on your ways.

29. When they are cast down, you will say, [There is] lifting up; And the humble person he will save.

30. He will deliver [even] him who is not innocent: Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.

## Job 23

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. Even today is my complaint rebellious: My hand is heavy on my groaning.

3. Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!

4. I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.

5. I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say to me.

6. Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; but he would give heed to me.

7. There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered forever from my judge.

8. Look, I go forward, but he is not [there]; And backward, but I can't perceive him;

9. On the left hand, when he does work, but I can't behold him; He hides himself on the right hand, that I can't see him.

10. But he knows the way that I take; When he has tried me, I will come forth as gold.

11. My foot has held fast to his steps; His way I have kept, and didn't turn aside.

12. I haven't gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.

13. But he is in one, and who can turn him? And what his soul desires, even that he does.

14. For he performs that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.

15. Therefore I am terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.

16. For God has made my heart faint, And the Almighty has terrified me;

17. Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.

## Job 24

1. Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why don't those who know him see his days?

2. They move the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.

3. They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox for a pledge.

4. They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves.

5. Look, as wild donkeys in the desert, They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness [yields] them bread for their children.

6. They cut their fodder in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked.

7. They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.

8. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

9. They pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;

10. [So that] they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves.

11. They make oil inside their walls; They tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst.

12. From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded cries out: Yet God does not regard the folly.

13. These are of those who rebel against the light; They don't know its ways, Nor remain in its paths.

14. The murderer rises with the light; He kills the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.

15. The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, No eye will see me: And he disguises his face.

16. In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the daytime; They don't know the light.

17. For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.

18. Swiftly they [pass away] on the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They don't turn into the way of the vineyards.

19. Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [So does] Sheol [those who] have sinned.

20. The womb will forget him; The worm will feed sweetly on him; He will be remembered no more; And unrighteousness will be broken as a tree.

21. He devours the barren that does not bear, And does not do good to the widow.

22. Yet [God] preserves the mighty by his power: He rises up that has no assurance of life.

23. [God] gives them to be in security, and they rest on it; And his eyes are on their ways.

24. They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as a [dried-up] flower, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.

25. And if it is not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech worth nothing?

## Job 25

1. Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,

2. Dominion and fear are with him; He makes peace in his high places.

3. Is there any number of his armies? And on whom does not his ambush arise?

4. How then can common man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of a woman?

5. Look, even the moon has no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his eyes:

6. How much less is common man, who is a worm! And the son of man, who is a worm!

## Job 26

1. Then Job answered and said,

2. How you have helped him who is without power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength!

3. How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!

4. To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from you?

5. The spirits of the dead tremble Beneath the waters and those that stay in them.

6. Sheol is naked before [God], And Abaddon has no covering.

7. He stretches out the north over empty space, And hangs the earth on nothing.

8. He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.

9. He encloses the face of the throne, And spreads his cloud on it.

10. He has described a boundary on the face of the waters, To the confines of light and darkness.

11. The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke.

12. He stirs up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.

13. By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand has pierced the swift serpent.

14. Look, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?

## Job 27

1. And Job again took up his parable, and said,

2. As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has vexed my soul:

3. (For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);

4. Surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness, Neither will my tongue utter deceit.

5. Far be it from me that I should justify you{+}: Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.

6. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart will not reproach [me] so long as I live.

7. Let my enemy be as the wicked, And let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.

8. For what is the hope of the godless, though he gets himself gain, When God takes away his soul?

9. Will God hear his cry, When trouble comes on him?

10. Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call on God at all times?

11. I will teach you{+} concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.

12. Look, all you{+} yourselves have seen it; Why then have you{+} become altogether vain?

13. This is the portion of [the] wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:

14. If his sons are multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring will not be satisfied with bread.

15. Those who remain of him will be buried in death, And his widows will make no lamentation.

16. Though he heaps up silver as the dust, And prepares raiment as the clay;

17. He may prepare it, but the just will put it on, And the innocent will divide the silver.

18. He builds his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper makes.

19. He lies down rich, but he will not be gathered [to his fathers]; He opens his eyes, and he is not.

20. Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest steals him away in the night.

21. The east wind carries him away, and he departs; And it sweeps him out of his place.

22. For [God] will hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.

23. Men will clap their hands at him, And will hiss him out of his place.

## Job 28

1. Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine.

2. Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone.

3. [Man] sets an end to darkness, And searches out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.

4. He breaks open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang far from common man, they swing to and fro.

5. As for the earth, out of it comes bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.

6. Its stones are the place of sapphires, And it has dust of gold.

7. That path no bird of prey knows, Neither has the falcon's eye seen it:

8. The proud beasts haven't trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed by it.

9. He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock; He overturns the mountains by the roots.

10. He cuts out channels among the rocks; And his eye sees every precious thing.

11. He dams up the sources of the rivers; And the thing that is hid he brings forth to light.

12. But where will wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?

13. Common man doesn't know its price; Neither is it found in the land of the living.

14. The deep says, It is not in me; And the sea says, It is not with me.

15. It can't be obtained for gold, Neither will silver be weighed for its price.

16. It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.

17. Gold and glass can't equal it, Neither will it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.

18. No mention will be made of coral or of crystal: Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.

19. The topaz of Ethiopia will not equal it, Neither will it be valued with pure gold.

20. From where then comes wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?

21. Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.

22. Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.

23. God understands its way, And he knows its place.

24. For he looks to the ends of the earth, And sees under the whole heaven;

25. To make a weight for the wind: Yes, he metes out the waters by measure.

26. When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;

27. Then he saw it, and declared it; He established it, yes, and searched it out.

28. And to man he said, Look, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.

## Job 29

1. And Job again took up his parable, and said,

2. Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;

3. When his lamp shined on my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;

4. As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was on my tent;

5. When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;

6. When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!

7. When I went forth to the gate to the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,

8. The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;

9. The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;

10. The voice of the leaders was hushed, And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.

11. For when the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; And when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me:

12. Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.

13. The blessing of him who was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

14. I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.

15. I was eyes to the blind, And I was feet to the lame.

16. I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him who I didn't know I searched out.

17. And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.

18. Then I said, I will die in my nest, And I will multiply my days as the sand:

19. My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lies all night on my branch;

20. My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.

21. To me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silent for my counsel.

22. After my words they did not speak again; And my speech distilled on them.

23. And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.

24. I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they did not cast down.

25. I chose out their way, and sat [as] chief, And stayed as a king in the army, As one who comforts the mourners.

## Job 30

1. But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.

2. Yes, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age has perished.

3. They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the desert, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.

4. They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food.

5. They are driven forth from the midst [of men]; They cry after them as after a thief;

6. So that they stay in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.

7. Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.

8. [They are] sons of fools, yes, sons of base men; They were scourged out of the land.

9. And now I have become their song, Yes, I am a byword to them.

10. They are disgusted by me, they stand aloof from me, And do not spare to spit in my face.

11. For he has loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.

12. On my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.

13. They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, [Even] men who have no helper.

14. As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves [on me].

15. Terrors are turned on me; They chase my honor as the wind; And my welfare has passed away as a cloud.

16. And now my soul is poured out inside me; Days of affliction have taken hold on me.

17. In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the [pains] that gnaw me take no rest.

18. By [God's] great force is my garment disfigured; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.

19. He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes.

20. I cry to you, and you do not answer me: I stand up, and you gaze at me.

21. You have turned to be cruel to me; With the might of your hand you persecute me.

22. You lift me up to the wind, you cause me to ride [on it]; And you dissolve me in the storm.

23. For I know that you will bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.

24. Nevertheless, does not one stretch out his hand when he falls? And, when he is ruined, cry for help because of it?

25. Didn't I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn't my soul grieved for the needy?

26. When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.

27. My insides are troubled, and do not rest; Days of affliction have come upon me.

28. I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.

29. I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.

30. My skin is black, [and falls] from me, And my bones are burned with heat.

31. Therefore my harp is [turned] to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of those who weep.

## Job 31

1. I made a covenant with my eyes; How then should I look at a virgin?

2. For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high?

3. Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity?

4. Doesn't he see my ways, And number all my steps?

5. If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot has hurried to deceit

6. (Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know my integrity);

7. If my step has turned out of the way, And my heart walked after my eyes, And if any spot has stuck to my hands:

8. Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.

9. If my heart has been enticed to a woman, And I have laid wait at my fellow man's door;

10. Then let my wife grind to another, And let others have sex with her.

11. For that were a heinous crime; Yes, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:

12. For it is a fire that consumes to Destruction, And would root out all my increase.

13. If I have despised the cause of my male slave or of my female slave, When they contended with me;

14. What then shall I do when God rises up? And when he visits, what shall I answer him?

15. Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?

16. If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

17. Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless has not eaten of it

18. (No, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her I have guided from my mother's womb);

19. If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;

20. If his loins haven't blessed me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

21. If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate:

22. Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And my arm be broken from the bone.

23. For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.

24. If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, [You are] my confidence;

25. If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much;

26. If I have seen the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness,

27. And my heart has been secretly enticed, And my mouth has kissed my hand:

28. This also was an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God who is above.

29. If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him;

30. (Yes, I haven't allowed my mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse);

31. If the men of my tent haven't said, Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?

32. (The sojourner has not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveler);

33. If like man I have covered my transgressions, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,

34. Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silent, and didn't go out of the door-

35. Oh that I had one to hear me! (Look, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); And [that I had] the indictment which my adversary has written!

36. Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it to me as a crown:

37. I would declare to him the number of my steps; As a leader I would go near to him.

38. If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together;

39. If I have eaten its fruits without money, Or have caused its owners to lose their life:

40. Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.

## Job 32

1. So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.

2. Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

3. Also against his three companions was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

4. Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.

5. And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.

6. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you{+} are very old; Therefore I held back, and didn't dare show you{+} my opinion.

7. I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.

8. But there is a spirit in common man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.

9. It is not the great who are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice.

10. Therefore I said, Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.

11. Look, I waited for your{+} words, I listened for your{+} reasonings, While you{+} searched out what to say.

12. Yes, I attended to you{+}, And, look, there was none who convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you{+}.

13. Beware you{+} don't say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:

14. For he has not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your{+} speeches.

15. They are amazed, they answer no more: They haven't a word to say.

16. And shall I wait, because they don't speak, Because they stand still, and answer no more?

17. I also will answer my part, I also will show my opinion.

18. For I am full of words; The spirit inside me constrains me.

19. Look, my breast is as wine which has no vent; Like blacksmith's bellows it is ready to burst.

20. I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.

21. Don't let me, I pray you{+}, respect a man's person; Neither will I give flattering titles to any among man.

22. For I don't know to give flattering titles; [Else] would my Maker soon take me away.

## Job 33

1. Nevertheless, Job, I pray you, hear my speech, And listen to all my words.

2. Look now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue has spoken in my mouth.

3. My words [will utter] the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they will speak sincerely.

4. The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

5. If you can, answer me; Set [your words] in order before me, stand forth.

6. Look, I am toward God even as you are: I also am formed out of the clay.

7. Look, my terror will not make you afraid, Neither will my pressure be heavy on you.

8. Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of [your] words, [saying],

9. I am clean, without transgression; I am pure, neither is there iniquity in me:

10. Look, he finds occasions against me, He counts me for his enemy:

11. He puts my feet in the stocks, He marks all my paths.

12. Look, I will answer you, in this you are not just; For God is greater than common man.

13. Why do you strive against him Because he doesn't give account of any of his matters?

14. For God speaks once, Yes twice, [though man] does not regard it.

15. In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls on men, In slumberings on the bed;

16. Then he opens the ears of men, And seals their warning,

17. That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, And hide pride from a [noble] man;

18. He keeps back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.

19. He is chastened also with pain on his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;

20. So that his life abhors bread, And his soul dainty food.

21. His flesh is consumed away, that it can't be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.

22. Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, And his life to the destroyers.

23. If there is with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show to man what is right for him;

24. Then [God] is gracious to him, and says, Protect him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.

25. His flesh becomes fresher than a child's; He returns to the days of his youth.

26. He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, So that he sees his face with joy: And he restores to common man his righteousness.

27. He sings before men, and says, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it didn't profit me:

28. He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life will see the light.

29. Look, God works all these things, Twice, [yes] thrice, with a [noble] man,

30. To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

31. Mark well, O Job, listen to me: Hold your peace, and I will speak.

32. If you have anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify you.

33. If not, listen to me: Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.

## Job 34

1. Moreover Elihu answered and said,

2. Hear my words, you{+} wise men; And give ear to me, you{+} who have knowledge.

3. For the ear tries words, As the palate tastes food.

4. Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.

5. For Job has said, I am righteous, And God has taken away my right:

6. Against my right he has lied; My wound is incurable, [though I am] without transgression.

7. What [noble] man is like Job, Who drinks up scoffing like water,

8. Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?

9. For he has said, It profits a [noble] man nothing That he should delight himself with God.

10. Therefore listen to me, you{+} men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.

11. For the work of man he will render to him, And cause a man to find according to his ways.

12. Yes, certainly, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.

13. Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who has disposed the whole world?

14. If he sets his heart on himself, [If] he gathers to himself his spirit and his breath;

15. All flesh will perish together, And man will turn again to dust.

16. If now [you have] understanding, hear this: Listen to the voice of my words.

17. Will even one who hates justice govern? And will you condemn him who is righteous [and] mighty?--

18. [Him] who says to a king, [You are] vile, [Or] to nobles, [You{+} are] wicked;

19. Who does not respect the persons of princes, Nor regards the rich more than the poor; For all of them are the work of his hands.

20. In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a [human] hand.

21. For his eyes are on the ways of a man, And he sees all his goings.

22. There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

23. For he does not need further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.

24. He breaks in pieces mighty men [in ways] past finding out, And sets others in their stead.

25. Therefore he takes knowledge of their works; And he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.

26. He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others;

27. Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:

28. So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.

29. When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether [it is done] to a nation, or to man:

30. He makes king [the] godless man From among the seducers of the people.

31. For has any said to God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [anymore]:

32. That which I don't see teach me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?

33. Will his recompense be as you will, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what you know.

34. Men of understanding will say to me, And the wise [noble] man will listen to me:

35. Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.

36. Oh that Job were tried to the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.

37. For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.

## Job 35

1. Moreover Elihu answered and said,

2. Do you think this to be [your] right, [Or] do you say, My righteousness is more than God's,

3. That you say, What advantage will it be to you? [And], What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?

4. I will answer you, And your companions with you.

5. Look to the heavens, and see; And look at the skies, which are higher than you.

6. If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?

7. If you are righteous, what do you give him? Or what does he receive of your hand?

8. Your wickedness [may hurt] a man as you are; And your righteousness [may profit] a son of man.

9. By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.

10. But none says, Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,

11. Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?

12. There they cry, but none gives answer, Because of the pride of evil men.

13. Surely God will not hear an empty [cry], Neither will the Almighty regard it.

14. How much less when you say you don't see him, The cause is before him, and you wait for him!

15. But now, because he has not visited in his anger, Neither does he greatly regard foolishness;

16. Therefore Job opens his mouth in vanity; He multiplies words without knowledge.

## Job 36

1. Elihu also proceeded, and said,

2. Allow me a little, and I will show you; For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf.

3. I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

4. For truly my words are not false: One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

5. Look, God is mighty, and does not despise any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.

6. He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives to the afflicted [their] right.

7. He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous: But with kings on the throne He sets them forever, and they are exalted.

8. And if they are bound in fetters, And are taken in the cords of afflictions;

9. Then he shows them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.

10. He opens also their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from iniquity.

11. If they listen and serve [him], They will spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.

12. But if they don't listen, they will perish by the sword, And they will die without knowledge.

13. But those who are godless in heart lay up anger: They don't cry for help when he binds them.

14. They die in youth, And their life [perishes] among the homosexuals.

15. He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, And opens their ear in oppression.

16. Yes, he would have allured you out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on your table would be full of fatness.

17. But you are full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold [on you].

18. For beware that wrath doesn't stir you up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.

19. Will your cry avail, [that you are] not in distress, Or all the forces of [your] strength?

20. Do not desire the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.

21. Take heed, do not regard iniquity: For this you have chosen rather than affliction.

22. Look, God does loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like him?

23. Who has enjoined him his way? Or who can say, You have wrought unrighteousness?

24. Remember that you magnify his work, Of which men have sung.

25. All of man have looked on it; Common man watches it far off.

26. Look, God is great, and we don't know him; The number of his years is unsearchable.

27. For he draws up the drops of water, Which distill in rain from his vapor,

28. Which the skies pour down And drop on man abundantly.

29. Yes, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?

30. Look, he spreads his light around him; And he covers the bottom of the sea.

31. For by these he judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance.

32. He covers his hands with the lightning, And gives it a charge that it strikes the mark.

33. The noise of it tells concerning him, The cattle also [tell] concerning [the storm] that comes up.

## Job 37

1. Yes, at this my heart trembles, And is moved out of its place.

2. Hear carefully the noise of his voice, And the sound that goes out of his mouth.

3. He sends it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightning to the ends of the earth.

4. After it a voice roars; He thunders with the voice of his majesty; And he does not restrain [the lightnings] when his voice is heard.

5. God thunders marvelously with his voice; Great things he does, which we can't comprehend.

6. For he says to the snow, Fall on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.

7. He seals up the hand of all of man, That all men whom he has made may know [it].

8. Then the beasts go into coverts, And stay in their dens.

9. Out of the chamber [of the south] comes the storm, And cold out of the north.

10. By the breath of God ice is given; And the width of the waters is straitened.

11. Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture; He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning:

12. And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatever he commands them On the face of the habitable world,

13. Whether it is for correction, or for his land, Or for loving-kindness, that he causes it to come.

14. Listen to this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.

15. Do you know how God lays [his charge] on them, And causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?

16. Do you know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?

17. How your garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south [wind]?

18. Can you with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?

19. Teach us what we will say to him; [For] we can't set [our speech] in order by reason of darkness.

20. Will it be told to him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?

21. And now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passes, and clears them.

22. Out of the north comes golden splendor: God has on him awesome majesty.

23. [Concerning] the Almighty, we can't find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.

24. Men therefore fear him: He does not regard any who are wise of heart.

## Job 38

1. Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

2. Who is this that darkens counsel By words without knowledge?

3. Gird up now your loins like a [noble] man; For I will demand of you, and you declare to me.

4. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.

5. Who determined its measures, if you know? Or who stretched the line on it?

6. On what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,

7. When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?

8. Or [who] shut up the sea with doors, When it broke forth, [as if] it had issued out of the womb;

9. When I made clouds its garment, And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,

10. And marked out for it my bound, And set bars and doors,

11. And said, This far you will come, but no further; And here will your proud waves be placed?

12. Have you commanded the morning since your days [began], [And] caused the sunrise to know its place;

13. That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?

14. It is changed as clay under the seal; And [all things] stand forth as a garment:

15. And from the wicked their light is withheld, And the high arm is broken.

16. Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?

17. Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?

18. Have you comprehended the earth in its width? Declare, if you know it all.

19. Where is the way to the place that light stays? And as for darkness, where is its place,

20. That you should take it to its bound, And that you should discern the paths to its house?

21. [Doubtless], you know, for you were then born, And the number of your days is great!

22. Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, Or have you seen the treasures of the hail,

23. Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?

24. Where is the way to the place that light is distributed, Or [from where is] the east wind scattered on the earth?

25. Who has cleft a channel for the floodwater, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;

26. To cause it to rain on a land where there is not a man; On the wilderness, in which there is not man;

27. To satisfy the waste and desolate [ground], And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?

28. Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?

29. Out of whose womb came the ice? And the frost of heaven, who has given birth to it?

30. The waters hide themselves [and become] like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.

31. Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?

32. Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or can you guide the Bear with her train?

33. Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their dominion in the earth?

34. Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover you?

35. Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say to you, Here we are?

36. Who has put wisdom in the ibis? Or who has given understanding to the rooster?

37. Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,

38. When the dust runs into a mass, And the clods are stuck together?

39. Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

40. When they couch in their dens, [And] remain in the covert to lie in wait?

41. Who provides for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry to God, [And] wander for lack of food?

## Job 39

1. Do you know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? [Or] can you mark when the hinds calve?

2. Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bring forth?

3. They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.

4. Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and don't return again.

5. Who has sent out the wild donkey free? Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,

6. Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?

7. He scorns the tumult of the city, Neither does he hear the shoutings of the driver.

8. The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searches after every green thing.

9. Will the wild-ox be content to serve you? Or will he spend the night by your crib?

10. Can you bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?

11. Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor?

12. Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, And gather [the grain] of your threshing-floor?

13. The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; [But] is it a pious plumage and down?

14. For she leaves her eggs on the earth, And warms them in the dust,

15. And forgets that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.

16. She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor is in vain, [she is] without fear;

17. Because God has deprived her of wisdom, Neither has he imparted to her understanding.

18. What time she lifts up herself on high, She scorns the horse and his rider.

19. Have you given the horse [his] might? Have you clothed his neck with the quivering mane?

20. Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.

21. He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength: He goes out to meet the armed men.

22. He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither does he turn back from the sword.

23. The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.

24. He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither does he believe that it is the voice of the trumpet.

25. As often as the trumpet [sounds] he says, Aha! And he smells the battle far off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

26. Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, (And) stretches her wings toward the south?

27. Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, And makes her nest on high?

28. On the cliff she dwells, and makes her home, On the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.

29. From there she spies out the prey; Her eyes watch it far off.

30. Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there she is.

## Job 40

1. Moreover Yahweh answered Job, and said,

2. Will he who criticizes contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.

3. Then Job answered Yahweh, and said,

4. Look, I am of small account; What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.

5. Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.

6. Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

7. Gird up your loins now like a [noble] man: I will demand of you, and you declare to me.

8. Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?

9. Or do you have an arm like God? And can you thunder with a voice like him?

10. Deck yourself now with excellency and dignity; And array yourself with honor and majesty.

11. Pour forth the overflowings of your anger; And look at everyone who is proud, and abase him.

12. Look at everyone who is proud, [and] bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand.

13. Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden [place].

14. Then I will also confess of you That your own right hand can save you.

15. Now look at behemoth, which I made as well as you; He eats grass as an ox.

16. See now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly.

17. He moves his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together.

18. His bones are [as] tubes of bronze; His limbs are like bars of iron.

19. He is the chief of the ways of God: [Only] he who made him brings his sword near.

20. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field play.

21. He lies under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen.

22. The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook circle him about.

23. Look, if a river overflows, he does not tremble; He is confident, though a Jordan swells even to his mouth.

24. Will any take him before his eyes, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?

## Job 41

1. Can you draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?

2. Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?

3. Will he make many supplications to you? Or will he speak soft words to you?

4. Will he make a covenant with you, That you should take him for a slave forever?

5. Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your maidens?

6. Will the bands [of fishermen] make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?

7. Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?

8. Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.

9. Look, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be overcome even at the sight of him?

10. None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?

11. Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? [Whatever is] under the whole heaven is mine.

12. I will not keep silent concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.

13. Who can strip off his outer garment? Who will come inside his jaws?

14. Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.

15. [His] strong scales are [his] back, Shut up together [as with] a close seal.

16. One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.

17. They are stuck [as close as] a man to his brother; They join together, so that they can't be sundered.

18. His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

19. Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.

20. Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, As of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes.

21. His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth.

22. In his neck resides strength, And terror dances before him.

23. The flakes of his flesh are stuck: They are firm on him; they can't be moved.

24. His heart is as firm as a stone; Yes, firm as the nether millstone.

25. When he raises himself up, the gods are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.

26. If one lays at him with the sword, it can't avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.

27. He counts iron as straw, [And] bronze as rotten wood.

28. The arrow can't make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.

29. Clubs are counted as stubble: He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.

30. His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds: He spreads [as it were] a threshing-wain on the mire.

31. He makes the deep to boil like a pot: He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

32. He makes a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be gray-headed.

33. On earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.

34. He beholds everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.

## Job 42

1. Then Job answered Yahweh, and said,

2. I know that you can do all things, And that no purpose of yours can be restrained.

3. Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have uttered that which I didn't understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I didn't know.

4. Hear, I urge you, and I will speak; I will demand of you, and declare you to me.

5. I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees you:

6. Therefore I abhor [myself], And repent in dust and ashes.

7. And it was so, that, after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two companions; for you{+} have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my slave Job has.

8. Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my slave Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my slave Job will pray for you{+}; for him I will accept, that I do not deal with you{+} after your{+} folly; for you{+} have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my slave Job has.

9. So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according to as Yahweh commanded them: and Yahweh accepted Job.

10. And Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his companions: and Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.

11. Then there came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.

12. So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.

13. He had also seven sons and three daughters.

14. And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.

15. And in all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.

16. And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.

17. So Job died, being old and full of days.
