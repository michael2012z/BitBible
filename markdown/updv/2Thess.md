# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;

2. Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We are bound to give thanks to God always for you{+}, brothers, even as it is meet, for that your{+} faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of all you{+} toward one another abounds;

4. so that we ourselves glory in you{+} in the churches of God for your{+} patience and faith in all your{+} persecutions and in the afflictions which you{+} endure;

5. [which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that you{+} may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you{+} also suffer:

6. since it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to those who afflict you{+},

7. and to you{+} who are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,

8. rendering vengeance to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus:

9. who will pay a penalty of eternal destruction away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,

10. when he will come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all those who believed (because our testimony to you{+} was believed) in that day.

11. To which end we also pray always for you{+}, that our God may count you{+} worthy of your{+} calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and [every] work of faith, with power;

12. that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you{+}, and you{+} in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. Now we urge you{+}, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him;

2. to the end that you{+} are not quickly shaken from your{+} mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;

3. let no man beguile you{+} in any wise: for [it will not be,] except the falling away comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition,

4. he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.

5. Don't you{+} remember, that, when I was yet with you{+}, I told you{+} these things?

6. And now you{+} know that which restrains, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.

7. For the mystery of lawlessness does already work: only [there is] one who restrains now, until he is removed.

8. And then will be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his coming;

9. [even he], whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,

10. and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

11. And for this cause God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:

12. that all who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness, would be judged.

13. But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you{+}, brothers beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you{+} from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:

14. to which he also called you{+} through our good news, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. So then, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you{+} were taught, whether by word, or by letter of ours.

16. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,

17. comfort your{+} hearts and establish them in every good work and word.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also [it is] with you{+};

2. and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all do not have faith.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you{+}, and guard you{+} from the evil [one].

4. And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you{+}, that you{+} both do and will do the things which we command.

5. And may the Lord direct your{+} hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.

6. Now we command you{+}, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you{+} withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.

7. For you{+} yourselves know how you{+} ought to imitate us: for we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you{+};

8. neither did we eat bread for nothing at any man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you{+}:

9. not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you{+}, that you{+} should imitate us.

10. For even when we were with you{+}, this we commanded you{+}, If any will not work, neither let him eat.

11. For we hear of some that walk among you{+} disorderly, that don't work at all, but are busybodies.

12. Now those who are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness, and eat their own bread.

13. But you{+}, brothers, don't be weary in well-doing.

14. And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, that you{+} do not associate with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.

15. And [yet] do not count as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

16. Now may the Lord of peace himself give you{+} peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with all of you{+}.

17. The salutation of me Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you{+}.
