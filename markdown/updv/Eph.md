# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:

2. Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly [places] in Christ:

4. even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:

5. having preappointed us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

6. to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:

7. in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,

8. which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,

9. making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him

10. to a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth; in him, [I say,]

11. in whom also we were made a heritage, having been preappointed according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;

12. to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:

13. in whom you{+} also, having heard the word of the truth, the good news of your{+} salvation, --in whom, having also believed, you{+} were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,

14. which is a security deposit of our inheritance, to the redemption of [God's] own possession, to the praise of his glory.

15. For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you{+}, and the love which [you{+} show] toward all the saints,

16. do not cease to give thanks for you{+}, making mention [of you{+}] in my prayers;

17. that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you{+} a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;

18. having the eyes of your{+} heart enlightened, that you{+} may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

19. and what is the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might

20. which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly [places],

21. far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come:

22. and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,

23. which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all things in all.

## Ephesians 2

1. And you{+} [he made alive,] when you{+} were dead through your{+} trespasses and sins,

2. in which you{+} once walked according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience;

3. among whom we also all once lived in the desire of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:--

4. but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,

5. even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ, (by grace you{+} have been saved)

6. and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly [places], in Christ Jesus:

7. that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:

8. for by grace you{+} have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, [it is] the gift of God;

9. not of works, that no man should boast.

10. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared in advance that we should walk in them.

11. Therefore remember, that once you{+}, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;

12. that you{+} were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

13. But now in Christ Jesus you{+} who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.

14. For he is our peace, who made both one, and in his flesh broke down the middle wall of partition, the enmity.

15. Having abolished the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; that he might create in himself the two into one new man, [so] making peace;

16. and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in himself:

17. and he came and preached [the good news of] peace to you{+} who were far off, and peace to those who were near:

18. for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.

19. So then you{+} are no more strangers and sojourners, but you{+} are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,

20. being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;

21. in whom each building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;

22. in whom you{+} also are built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.

## Ephesians 3

1. For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you{+} Gentiles--

2. if indeed you{+} have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given to me toward you{+};

3. how that by revelation was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,

4. by which, when you{+} read, you{+} can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;

5. which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;

6. [to wit], that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news,

7. of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.

8. To me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles [the good news of] the unsearchable riches of Christ;

9. and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which since the [past] ages has been hid in God who created all things;

10. to the intent that now to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly [places] might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,

11. according to the purpose of the ages which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord:

12. in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.

13. Therefore I ask that you{+} may not faint at my tribulations for you{+}, which are your{+} glory.

14. For this cause I bow my knees to the Father,

15. from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,

16. that he would grant you{+}, according to the riches of his glory, that you{+} may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;

17. that Christ may dwell in your{+} hearts through faith; to the end that you{+}, being rooted and grounded in love,

18. may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,

19. and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you{+} may be filled to all the fullness of God.

20. Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,

21. to him [be] the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all the generations of forever and ever. Amen.

## Ephesians 4

1. I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, urge you{+} to walk worthily of the calling with which you{+} were called,

2. with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;

3. being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

4. [There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as also you{+} were called in one hope of your{+} calling;

5. one Lord, one faith, one baptism;

6. one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.

7. But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

8. Therefore he says, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, he gave gifts to men.

9. (Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?

10. He who descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)

11. And he gave some [to be] apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

12. for the preparing of the saints, to the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ:

13. until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:

14. that we may no longer be juveniles, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;

15. but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, [even] Christ;

16. from whom all the body being joined and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in [due] measure of each individual part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.

17. This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you{+} no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,

18. being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;

19. who, feeling no more pain, delivered themselves up to sexual immorality, to work all impurity with greed.

20. But you{+} did not so learn Christ;

21. if indeed you{+} heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:

22. that you{+} put away, as concerning your{+} former manner of life, the old man, that waxes corrupt after the desires of deceit;

23. and that you{+} are renewed in the spirit of your{+} mind,

24. and put on the new man, that after God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.

25. Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak{+} truth each one with his fellow man: for we are members one of another.

26. Be{+} angry, and don't sin: don't let the sun go down on your{+} wrath:

27. neither give place to the devil.

28. Let him who stole steal no more: and even better, let him labor, working with his own hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.

29. Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your{+} mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.

30. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you{+} were sealed to the day of redemption.

31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you{+}, with all malice:

32. and be{+} kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you{+}.

## Ephesians 5

1. Be{+} therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;

2. and walk in love, even as Christ also loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.

3. But fornication, all impurity, or greed, don't let it even be named among you{+}, as becomes saints;

4. nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.

5. For this you{+} know for sure, that anyone who is a fornicator, or unclean, or greedy (that is, an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

6. Let no man deceive you{+} with empty words: for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.

7. Therefore don't be{+} partakers with them;

8. For you{+} were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light,

9. --for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth--

10. proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord;

11. and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and even better, reprove them as well;

12. for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.

13. But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light,

14. for everything that is made manifest is light. Therefore [he] says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.

15. Look therefore carefully how you{+} walk, not as unwise, but as wise;

16. redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

17. Therefore don't be{+} foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

18. And don't be drunk with wine, in which is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;

19. speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your{+} heart to the Lord;

20. giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;

21. subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.

22. Wives, [be in subjection] to your{+} own husbands, as to the Lord.

23. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, [being] himself the savior of the body.

24. But as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives also [be] to their husbands in everything.

25. Husbands, love your{+} wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it;

26. that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,

27. that he might present the church to himself a glorious [church], not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

28. Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself:

29. for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church;

30. because we are members of his body.

31. For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will stick to his wife; and the two will become one flesh.

32. This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.

33. Nevertheless, let each one of you{+} also love his own wife even as himself; but the wife should fear her husband.

## Ephesians 6

1. Children, obey your{+} parents in the Lord: for this is right.

2. Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),

3. that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.

4. And, you{+} fathers, do not provoke your{+} children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.

5. Slaves, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your{+} masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your{+} heart, as to Christ;

6. not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

7. with good will serving as slaves, as to the Lord, and not to men:

8. knowing that whatever good thing each one does, the same he will receive again from the Lord, whether slave or free.

9. And, you{+} masters, do the same things to them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours{+} is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.

10. Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.

11. Put on the whole armor of God, that you{+} may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

12. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].

13. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you{+} may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.

14. Stand therefore, having girded your{+} loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,

15. and having fastened your{+} feet in the foundation of the good news of peace;

16. as well taking up the shield of faith, with which you{+} will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil [one].

17. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

18. with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,

19. And on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the good news,

20. for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

21. But that you{+} also may know my affairs, what I participate in, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you{+} all things:

22. whom I have sent to you{+} for this very purpose, that you{+} may know our state, and that he may comfort your{+} hearts.

23. Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

24. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with [a love] incorruptible.
