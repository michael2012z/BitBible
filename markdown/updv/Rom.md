## Romans 1

1. Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the good news of God,

2. which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,

3. concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,

4. who was declared the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,

5. through whom we received grace and apostleship, to obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;

6. among whom you{+} are also [the] called of Jesus Christ:

7. To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, [the] called saints: Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you{+}, that your{+} faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.

9. For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, how I unceasingly remember you{+}

10. always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you{+}.

11. For I long to see you{+}, that I may impart to you{+} some spiritual gift, to the end you{+} may be established;

12. that is, that I with you{+} may be comforted in you{+}, each of us by the other's faith, both yours{+} and mine.

13. And I would not have you{+} ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you{+} (and was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit in you{+} also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.

14. I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.

15. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the good news to you{+} also who are in Rome.

16. For I am not ashamed of the good news: for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

17. For in it is revealed a righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is written, But the righteous will live by faith.

18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness;

19. because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it to them.

20. For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, [even] his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse:

21. because knowing God, they did not glorify him as God or give thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.

22. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23. and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.

24. Therefore God delivered them up in the desires of their hearts to impurity, that their bodies should be shamed among themselves:

25. they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

26. For this cause God delivered them up to immoral sexual passions of shame: for even their women changed the natural use into what is against nature:

27. and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, became passionate with each other, men with men, shamefully having sex together, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.

28. And even as they did not approve to have God in [their] knowledge, God delivered them up to a disapproved mind, to do those things which are not fitting;

29. being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

30. backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31. without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:

32. who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who participate in such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also give their approval to those who participate in them.

## Romans 2

1. Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are that judge: for in what you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge participate in the same things.

2. And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who participate in such things.

3. And reckon this, O man, who judge those who participate in such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?

4. Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?

5. But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;

6. who will render to every man according to his works:

7. to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:

8. but to those who are factious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [will be] wrath and indignation,

9. tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;

10. but glory and honor and peace to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:

11. for there is no respect of persons with God.

12. For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law;

13. for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law will be justified:

14. (for when Gentiles that don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law to themselves;

15. in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness with them, and their thoughts one with another accusing or excusing [them]);

16. in the day when God judges the secrets of men, according to my good news, by Christ Jesus.

17. But if you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,

18. and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,

19. and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,

20. a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of juveniles, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;

21. you therefore that teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach a man should not steal, do you steal?

22. You who say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?

23. You who glory in the law, through your transgression of the law do you dishonor God?

24. For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you{+}, even as it is written.

25. For circumcision indeed profits, if you participate in the law: but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

26. If therefore the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?

27. And will not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?

28. For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:

29. but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.

## Romans 3

1. What advantage then has the Jew? Or what is the profit of circumcision?

2. Much in every way: first of all, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.

3. What then? If some were without faith, will their want of faith make of no effect the faithfulness of God?

4. God forbid: yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar; according to as it is written, That you might be justified in your words, And might prevail when you come into judgment.

5. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visits with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)

6. God forbid: for then how will God judge the world?

7. But if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?

8. And why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? Whose condemnation is just.

9. What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;

10. as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;

11. There is none who understands, There is none who seeks after God;

12. They have all turned aside, they have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not, so much as one:

13. Their throat is an open tomb; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:

14. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

15. Their feet are swift to shed blood;

16. Destruction and misery are in their ways;

17. And the way of peace they have not known:

18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

19. Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:

20. because by the works of the law will no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law [comes] the knowledge of sin.

21. But now apart from the law a righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

22. even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all those who believe; for there is no distinction;

23. for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;

24. being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

25. whom God set forth [to be] a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done previously, in the forbearance of God;

26. for the showing, [I say], of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.

27. Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No: but by a law of faith.

28. For we reckon that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.

29. Or is God [the God] of Jews only? Is he not [the God] of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also:

30. since there is [only] one God, he will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.

31. Do we then make the law of no effect through faith? God forbid: no, we establish the law.

## Romans 4

1. What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?

2. For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something of which to glory; but not toward God.

3. For what does the Scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.

4. Now to him who works, the wages aren't reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.

5. But to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.

6. Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man, to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works,

7. [saying], Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.

8. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not reckon.

9. Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcision, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.

10. How then was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:

11. and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision; that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also;

12. and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.

13. For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.

14. For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect:

15. for the law works wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.

16. For this cause [it is] of faith, that [it may be] according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all

17. (as it is written, A father of many nations I have made you) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.

18. Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So will your seed be.

19. And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb;

20. yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,

21. and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.

22. Therefore also it was reckoned to him for righteousness.

23. Now it wasn't written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned to him;

24. but for our sake also, to whom it will be reckoned, who believe on him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,

25. who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.

## Romans 5

1. Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;

2. through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

3. And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation works steadfastness;

4. and steadfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:

5. and hope does not put to shame; because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given to us.

6. For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.

7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for perhaps for the good man some one would even dare to die.

8. But God commends his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

9. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath [of God] through him.

10. For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;

11. and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.

12. Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, for that all sinned:--

13. for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.

14. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a figure of him who was to come.

15. But not as the trespass, so also [is] the gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.

16. And not as through one who sinned, [so] is the gift: for the judgment [came] of one to condemnation, but the gift [came] of many trespasses to justification.

17. For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, [even] Jesus Christ.

18. So then as through one trespass [the judgment came] to all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness [the gift came] to all men to justification of life.

19. For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one will the many be made righteous.

20. And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly:

21. that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 6

1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?

2. God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live in it?

3. Or are you{+} ignorant that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

4. We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.

5. For if we have become united with [him] in the likeness of his death, we will be also [in the likeness] of his resurrection;

6. knowing this, that our old man was crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be done away, it no longer to serve us as slaves to sin;

7. for he who has died is justified from sin.

8. But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;

9. knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death no more has dominion over him.

10. For the death that he died, he died to sin once: but the life that he lives, he lives to God.

11. Even so reckon{+} also yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.

12. Don't let sin therefore reign in your{+} mortal body, that you{+} should obey its desires:

13. neither present your{+} members to sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your{+} members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.

14. For sin will not have dominion over you{+}: for you{+} are not under law, but under grace.

15. What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.

16. Don't you{+} know, that to whom you{+} present yourselves [as] slaves to obedience, his slaves you{+} are whom you{+} obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?

17. But thanks be to God, that, whereas you{+} were slaves of sin, you{+} became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you{+} were delivered;

18. and being made free from sin, you{+} were made a slave to righteousness.

19. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your{+} flesh: for as you{+} presented your{+} members [as] slaves to impurity and to iniquity to iniquity, even so now present your{+} members [as] slaves to righteousness to sanctification.

20. For when you{+} were slaves of sin, you{+} were free in regard of righteousness.

21. What fruit then did you{+} have at that time in the things of which you{+} are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

22. But now being made free from sin and being made slaves to God, you{+} have your{+} fruit to sanctification, and the end eternal life.

23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 7

1. Or are you{+} ignorant, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?

2. For the woman who has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.

3. So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress: but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.

4. Therefore, my brothers, you{+} also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that you{+} should be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.

5. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.

6. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, in order to serve us as slaves in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.

7. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nevertheless, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, You will not covet:

8. but sin, finding occasion, worked in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin [is] dead.

9. And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived,

10. and I died, and the commandment, which [was] to life, this I found [to be] to death:

11. for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.

12. So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.

13. Did then that which is good become death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful.

14. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

15. For that which I do, I don't know: for what I do not want, that I participate in; but what I hate, that I do.

16. But if what I do not want, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.

17. So now I no longer am the one who does it, but sin which dwells in me.

18. For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing: for to want is present with me, but to do that which is good [is] not.

19. For the good which I want, I do not: but the evil which I do not want, that I participate in.

20. But if I do what I do not want, I no longer am the one who does it, but sin which dwells in me.

21. I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.

22. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

23. but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and capturing me in the law of sin which is in my members.

24. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?

25. But thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve as a slave to the law of God; but with the flesh, to the law of sin.

## Romans 8

1. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.

2. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made you free from the law of sin and of death.

3. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

4. that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who don't walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

5. For those who are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

6. For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:

7. because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:

8. and those who are in the flesh can't please God.

9. But you{+} are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you{+}. But if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of his.

10. And if Christ is in you{+}, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.

11. But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you{+}, he who raised up Christ from the dead will give life also to your{+} mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you{+}.

12. So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:

13. for if you{+} live after the flesh, you{+} must die; but if by the Spirit you{+} put to death the activities of the body, you{+} will live.

14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.

15. For you{+} didn't receive the spirit of slavery again to fear; but you{+} received the spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba, Father.

16. The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:

17. and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified with [him].

18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.

19. For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the revealing of the sons of God.

20. For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope

21. that the creation itself also will be delivered from the slavery of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.

22. For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.

23. And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan inside ourselves, waiting for [our] adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.

24. For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopes for that which he sees?

25. But if we hope for that which we don't see, [then] we wait for it with patience.

26. And in like manner the Spirit also helps our infirmity: for we don't know how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself makes intercession for [us] with groanings which can't be uttered;

27. and he who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.

28. And we know that to those who love God all things work together for good, to those who are called according to [his] purpose.

29. For whom he foreknew, he also preappointed [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers:

30. and whom he preappointed, those he also called: and whom he called, those he also justified: and whom he justified, those he also glorified.

31. What then shall we say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [is] against us?

32. He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?

33. Who will lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God who justifies;

34. who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, and what's more, who was raised, who also is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.

35. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

36. Even as it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

37. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

38. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,

39. nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 9

1. I say the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,

2. that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.

3. For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

4. who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;

5. whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh. May God, who is over all, be blessed forever. Amen.

6. But [it is] not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel:

7. neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac will your seed be called.

8. That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.

9. For this is a word of promise, According to this season I will come, and Sarah will have a son.

10. And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac--

11. for [the children] not being yet born, neither having participated in anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stay,

12. not of works, but of him who calls, it was said to her, The elder will serve as a slave to the younger.

13. According to as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.

14. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.

15. For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.

16. So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.

17. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I raised you up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.

18. So then he has mercy on whom he wants, and he hardens whom he wants.

19. You will say then to me, Why then does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?

20. On the contrary, O man, who are you that reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus?

21. Or has not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel to honor, and another to shame?

22. What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:

23. and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared in advance to glory,

24. [even] us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?

25. As he says also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.

26. And it will be, [that] in the place where it was said to them, You{+} are not my people, There they will be called sons of the living God.

27. And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved:

28. for the Lord will execute [his] word on the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.

29. And, as Isaiah has said before, Except Yahweh of hosts had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like Gomorrah.

30. What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:

31. but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at [that] law.

32. Why? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;

33. even as it is written, Look, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense: And he who believes on him will not be put to shame.

## Romans 10

1. Brothers, my heart's desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.

2. For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.

3. For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.

4. For Christ is the end of the law to righteousness to everyone who believes.

5. For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man who does those things will live by them.

6. But the righteousness which is of faith says thus, Don't say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)

7. or, Who will descend into the abyss? (That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)

8. But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:

9. that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and will believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

10. For with the heart man believes to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.

11. For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on him will not be put to shame.

12. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same [Lord] is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him:

13. for, Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.

14. How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?

15. And how will they preach, except they be sent? According to as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things!

16. But they did not all listen to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?

17. So belief [comes] of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.

18. But I say, Is it the case that they have not heard? On the contrary, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world.

19. But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses says, I will provoke you{+} to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding I will anger you{+}.

20. And Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found by those who did not seek me; I became manifest to those who did not ask of me.

21. But as to Israel he says, All the day long I spread out my hands to a disobedient and opposing people.

## Romans 11

1. I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

2. God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or don't you{+} know what the Scripture says of Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:

3. Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have dug down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

4. But what does the answer of God say to him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

5. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

6. But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.

7. What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he did not obtain; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:

8. according to as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.

9. And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumbling block, and a recompense to them:

10. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow down their back always.

11. I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.

12. Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness.

13. But I speak to you{+} who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my service;

14. if by any means I may provoke to jealousy [those who are] my flesh, and may save some of them.

15. For if the casting away of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what [will] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?

16. And if the first fruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

17. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became copartners with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;

18. do not glory over the branches: but if you glory, it is not you that bear the root, but the root you.

19. You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.

20. Very well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don't be highminded, but fear:

21. for if God didn't spare the natural branches, lest neither will he spare you.

22. See then the goodness and severity of God: toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, God's goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also will be cut off.

23. And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.

24. For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more will these, which are the natural [branches], be grafted into their own olive tree.

25. For I would not, brothers, have you{+} ignorant of this mystery, lest you{+} be wise in your{+} own conceits, that a hardening in part has befallen Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;

26. and so all Israel will be saved: even as it is written, There will come out of Zion the Deliverer; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

27. And this is my covenant to them, When I will take away their sins.

28. As concerning the good news, they are enemies for your{+} sake: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.

29. For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.

30. For as you{+} in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,

31. even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you{+} they also may now obtain mercy.

32. For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.

33. Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!

34. For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?

35. Or who has first given to him, and it will be recompensed to him again?

36. For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him [be] the glory forever. Amen.

## Romans 12

1. I urge you{+} therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your{+} bodies, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, [which is] your{+} spiritual service.

2. And don't be fashioned according to this age: but be transformed by the renewing of your{+} mind, that you{+} may prove what the will of God is--that [which is] good and acceptable and perfect.

3. For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you{+}, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according to as God has dealt to each man a measure of faith.

4. For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same activity:

5. so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.

6. And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of our faith;

7. or service, [let us give ourselves] to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;

8. or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, [let him do it] with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

9. Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; stick to that which is good.

10. In love of the brothers be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;

11. in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving as slaves to the Lord;

12. rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing steadfastly in prayer;

13. sharing to the necessities of the saints; given to the love for strangers.

14. Bless those who persecute you{+}; bless, and do not curse.

15. Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.

16. Be of the same mind one toward another. Don't set your{+} mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Don't be wise in your{+} own conceits.

17. Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.

18. If it is possible, as much as in you{+} lies, be at peace with all men.

19. Don't avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath [of God]: for it is written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will recompense, says the Lord.

20. But if your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him to drink: for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.

21. Don't be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

## Romans 13

1. Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the [powers] that be are appointed of God.

2. Therefore he who resists the power, withstands the ordinance of God: and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.

3. For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And do you want to not fear the power? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same:

4. for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword for nothing: for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who participates in evil.

5. Therefore [you{+}] must surely be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also because of conscience.

6. For this cause you{+} pay taxes also; for they are ministers of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.

7. Render to all their dues: tax to whom tax [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.

8. Owe no man anything, except to love one another: for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.

9. For this, You will not commit adultery, You will not kill, You will not steal, You will not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, You will love your fellow man as yourself.

10. Love works no ill to his fellow man: love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.

11. And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you{+} to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we believed.

12. The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.

13. Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in promiscuity and sexual immorality, not in strife and jealousy.

14. But put{+} on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don't make provision for the flesh, to [fulfill] the desires [of it].

## Romans 14

1. But him who is weak in faith receive to yourselves, [yet] not for decision of scruples.

2. One man has faith to eat all things: but he who is weak eats herbs.

3. Don't let him who eats set at nothing him who does not eat; and don't let him who does not eat judge him who eats: for God has received him.

4. Who are you that judges the household slave of another? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand; for the Lord has power to make him stand.

5. For one man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.

6. He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord: and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.

7. For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.

8. For whether we live, we live to the Lord; or whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.

9. For to this end Christ died and lived [again], that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.

10. But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you set at nothing your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment-seat of God.

11. For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, to me every knee will bow, And every tongue will confess to God.

12. So then each of us will give account of himself to God.

13. Let us not therefore judge one another anymore: but judge{+} this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion of falling.

14. I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is common of itself: except that to him who accounts anything to be common, to him it is common.

15. For if because of meat your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don't destroy with your meat him for whom Christ died.

16. Don't let then your{+} good be evil spoken of:

17. for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

18. For he who in this [way] is serving as a slave to Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.

19. So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may edify one another.

20. Don't overthrow the work of God for meat's sake. All things indeed are clean; nevertheless it is evil for that man who eats with offense.

21. It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [to do anything] by which your brother stumbles.

22. The faith which you have, you have to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not judge himself in that which he approves.

23. But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because [he eats] not of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.

## Romans 15

1. Now we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

2. Let each of us please his fellow man for that which is good, to edifying.

3. For Christ also didn't please himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.

4. For whatever things were written previously were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope.

5. Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you{+} to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:

6. that with one accord you{+} may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7. Therefore receive to yourselves one another, even as Christ also received you{+}, to the glory of God.

8. For I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises [given] to the fathers,

9. and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore I will give praise to you among the Gentiles, And sing to your name.

10. And again he says, Rejoice, you{+} Gentiles, with his people.

11. And again, Praise the Lord, all you{+} Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.

12. And again, Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, And he who rises to rule over the Gentiles; On him will the Gentiles hope.

13. Now may the God of hope fill you{+} with all joy and peace in believing, that you{+} may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.

14. And I myself also am persuaded of you{+}, my brothers, that you{+} yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

15. But I write the more boldly to you{+} in some measure, as putting you{+} again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given to me by God,

16. that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering the good news of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

17. Therefore I have glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.

18. For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,

19. in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and around [Jerusalem] even to Illyricum, I have fully preached the good news of Christ;

20. yes, making it my aim so to preach the good news, not where Christ was [already] named, that I might not build on another man's foundation;

21. but, according to as it is written, To those whom it was not told about him, they will see. And they who have not heard will understand.

22. Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you{+}:

23. but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you{+},

24. whenever I go to Spain (for I hope to see you{+} in my journey, and to be brought on my way to there by you{+}, if first in some measure I will have been satisfied with your{+} company)--

25. but now, I [say], I go to Jerusalem, serving the saints.

26. For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.

27. Yes, it has been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles shared in their spiritual things, they owe it [to them] also to minister to them in carnal things.

28. When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you{+} to Spain.

29. And I know that, when I come to you{+}, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

30. Now I urge you{+}, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you{+} strive together with me in your{+} prayers to God for me;

31. that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and [that] my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;

32. that I may come to you{+} in joy through the will of God, and together with you{+} find rest.

33. Now the God of peace be with all of you{+}. Amen.

## Romans 16

1. I commend to you{+} Phoebe, our sister, and who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:

2. that you{+} receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that you{+} assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you{+}: for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.

3. Greet Prisca and Aquila my coworkers in Christ Jesus,

4. who laid down their own necks for my life; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:

5. and [greet] the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first fruits of Asia to Christ.

6. Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on you{+}.

7. Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.

8. Greet Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.

9. Greet Urbanus our coworker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

10. Greet Apelles the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the [household] of Aristobulus.

11. Greet Herodion my kinsman. Greet them of the [household] of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.

12. Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.

13. Greet Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

14. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.

15. Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.

16. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you{+}.

17. Now I urge you{+}, brothers, mark those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you{+} learned: and turn away from them.

18. For those who are such do not serve as slaves to our Lord Christ, but to their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the blameless.

19. For your{+} obedience has come abroad to all men. I rejoice therefore over you{+}: but I would have you{+} wise to that which is good, and simple to that which is evil.

20. And the God of peace will bruise Satan under your{+} feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you{+}.

21. Timothy my coworker greets you{+}; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.

22. I Tertius, who write the letter, greet you{+} in the Lord.

23. Gaius my host, and of the whole church, greets you{+}. Erastus the treasurer of the city greets you{+}, and Quartus the brother.

24. []

25. Now to him who is able to establish you{+} according to my good news and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence through eternal times,

26. but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known to all the nations to obedience of faith:

27. to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever. Amen.
