# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,

2. to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of you in my supplications, night and day

4. longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;

5. having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in you also.

6. For which cause I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

7. For God did not give us a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.

8. Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the good news according to the power of God;

9. who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,

10. but has now been manifested by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the good news,

11. to which I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.

12. For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.

13. Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

14. That good thing which was committed to [you] guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.

15. This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

16. The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: for he often refreshed me, and wasn't ashamed of my chain;

17. but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me

18. (the Lord grant to him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

2. And the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.

3. Suffer hardship with [me], as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

4. No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.

5. And if also a man contends in the games, he is not crowned, except he has contended lawfully.

6. The husbandmen who labors must be the first to partake of the fruits.

7. Consider what I say; for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news:

9. in which I suffer hardship to bonds, as a criminal; but the word of God is not bound.

10. Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

11. Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we will also live with him:

12. if we endure, we will also reign with him: if we will deny him, he also will deny us:

13. if we are faithless, he stays faithful; for he can't deny himself.

14. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging [them] in the sight of God, that they are not to strive about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.

15. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed worker, correctly handling the word of truth.

16. But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,

17. and their word will eat as does a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

18. men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.

19. Nevertheless the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his: and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.

20. Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to shame.

21. If a man therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared to every good work.

22. But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

23. But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.

24. And the Lord's slave must not strive, but be gentle toward all, apt to teach, forbearing,

25. in meekness correcting those who oppose themselves; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of the truth,

26. and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come.

2. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

3. without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,

4. traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;

5. holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. From these also turn away.

6. For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by diverse desires,

7. ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

8. And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith.

9. But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.

10. But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,

11. persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.

12. Yes, and all who would live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

13. But evil men and impostors will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

14. But you stay in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them.

15. And that from a baby you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

16. All Scripture [is] inspired of God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness:

17. that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely to every good work.

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I charge [you] in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:

2. preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.

3. For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own desires;

4. and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.

5. But be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your service.

6. For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.

7. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:

8. from now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.

9. Be diligent to come shortly to me:

10. for Demas forsook me, having loved this present age, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

11. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you; for he is useful to me in [my] service.

12. But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.

13. The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:

15. of whom you also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.

16. At my first defense no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.

17. But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

18. The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.

19. Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.

21. Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.

22. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you{+}.
