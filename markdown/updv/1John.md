# 1 John

## 1 John 1

1. That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life

2. --and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you{+} the life, the eternal [life], which was with the Father, and was manifested to us--

3. that which we have seen and heard we declare to you{+} also, that you{+} also may have fellowship with us: yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:

4. and these things we write, that our joy may be made full.

5. And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you{+}, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

6. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't do the truth:

7. but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.

8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

## 1 John 2

1. My little children, these things I write to you{+} that you{+} may not sin. And if any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:

2. and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.

3. And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

4. He who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;

5. but whoever keeps his word, in him truly has the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:

6. he who says he stays in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.

7. Beloved, I don't write a new commandment to you{+}, but an old commandment which you{+} had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which you{+} heard.

8. Again, a new commandment I write to you{+}, which thing is true in him and in you{+}; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.

9. He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.

10. He who loves his brother stays in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.

11. But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

12. I write to you{+}, [my] little children, because your{+} sins are forgiven you{+} for his name's sake.

13. I write to you{+}, fathers, because you{+} know him who is from the beginning. I write to you{+}, young men, because you{+} have overcome the evil one.

14. I have written to you{+}, little children, because you{+} know the Father. I have written to you{+}, fathers, because you{+} know him who is from the beginning. I have written to you{+}, young men, because you{+} are strong, and the word of God stays in you{+}, and you{+} have overcome the evil one.

15. Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

16. For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the vain glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

17. And the world passes away, and its desire: but he who does the will of God stays forever.

18. Little children, it is the last hour: and as you{+} heard that antichrist comes, even now have there arisen many antichrists; therefore we know that it is the last hour.

19. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have stayed with us: but [they went out], that they might be made manifest that all of them are not of us.

20. And you{+} have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you{+} know.

21. I have not written to you{+} because you{+} don't know the truth, but because you{+} do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.

22. Who is the liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, [even] he who denies the Father and the Son.

23. Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father: he who confesses the Son has the Father also.

24. As for you{+}, let that stay in you{+} which you{+} heard from the beginning. If that which you{+} heard from the beginning stays in you{+}, you{+} also will stay in the Son, and in the Father.

25. And this is the promise which he promised us, [even] the eternal life.

26. These things I have written to you{+} concerning those who would lead you{+} astray.

27. And as for you{+}, the anointing which you{+} received of him stays in you{+}, and you{+} don't need that anyone teach you{+}; but as his anointing teaches you{+} concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you{+}, you{+} stay in him.

28. And now, [my] little children, stay in him; that, when he is manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

29. If you{+} know that he is righteous, you{+} know that everyone also that does righteousness is begotten of him.

## 1 John 3

1. Look at what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God; and [such] we are. For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it did not know him.

2. Beloved, we are now children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we will be. We know that, if he will be manifested, we will be like him; for we will see him even as he is.

3. And everyone who has this hope [set] on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.

4. Everyone who does sin, also does lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.

5. And you{+} know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.

6. Whoever stays in him doesn't sin: whoever sins has neither seen him nor known him.

7. [My] little children, let no man lead you{+} astray: he who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:

8. he who does sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

9. Whoever is begotten of God does not sin, because his seed stays in him: and he can't sin, because he is begotten of God.

10. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: anyone not doing righteousness is not of God, neither is he who is not loving his brother.

11. For this is the message which you{+} heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:

12. not as Cain [who] was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.

13. And don't marvel, brothers, if the world hates you{+}.

14. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn't love stays in death.

15. Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you{+} know that any murderer does not have eternal life staying in him.

16. Hereby we know love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.

17. But whoever has the world's goods, and looks at his brother in need, and shuts up his compassion from him, how does the love of God stay in him?

18. [My] Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.

19. And hereby we will know that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before him:

20. because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.

21. Beloved, if our heart doesn't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;

22. and whatever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.

23. And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.

24. And he who keeps his commandments stays in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.

## 1 John 4

1. Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

2. Hereby you{+} know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God:

3. and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God: and this is the [spirit] of the antichrist, of which you{+} have heard that it comes; and now it is in the world already.

4. You{+} are of God, [my] little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he who is in you{+} than he who is in the world.

5. They are of the world: therefore they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them.

6. We are of God: he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

7. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone who loves is begotten of God, and knows God.

8. He who doesn't love doesn't know God; for God is love.

9. In this was the love of God manifested in us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.

10. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.

11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

12. No man has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God stays in us, and his love is perfected in us:

13. hereby we know that we stay in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.

14. And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [to be] the Savior of the world.

15. Whoever will confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God stays in him, and he in God.

16. And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love; and he who stays in love stays in God, and God stays in him.

17. In this love has been made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.

18. There is no fear in love: but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment; and he who fears has not been made perfect in love.

19. We love, because he first loved us.

20. If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, can't love God whom he has not seen.

21. And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God love his brother also.

## 1 John 5

1. Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whoever loves him who begot loves him also who is begotten of him.

2. Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.

3. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

4. For whatever is begotten of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that has overcome the world, [even] our faith.

5. And who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

6. This is he who came through water and blood: Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood. And the Spirit is who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.

7. For there are three who bear witness,

8. the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three are in [agreement as] one.

9. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he has borne witness concerning his Son.

10. He who believes on the Son of God, has the witness in himself: he who doesn't believe God, has made him a liar; because he has not believed in the witness that God has borne concerning his Son.

11. And the witness is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

12. He who has the Son, has the life; he who does not have the Son of God, does not have the life.

13. These things I have written to you{+}, that you{+} may know that you{+} have eternal life, [even] to you{+} who believe on the name of the Son of God.

14. And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:

15. and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.

16. If any man sees his brother sinning a sin not to death, he will ask, and [God] will give him life--for those who sin not to death. There is sin to death: [but] that's not what I am saying he should ask about.

17. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is sin not to death.

18. We know that whoever is begotten of God does not sin; but he who was begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.

19. We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.

20. And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

21. [My] little children, guard yourselves from idols.
