# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;

2. to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. As I exhorted you to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,

4. neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; [so do I now].

5. But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:

6. from which things some having swerved have turned aside to vain talking;

7. desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor what they confidently affirm.

8. But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,

9. as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

10. for fornicators, for homosexuals, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;

11. according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

12. I thank him who enabled me, [even] Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to [his] service;

13. though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: nevertheless I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;

14. and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

15. Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:

16. nevertheless for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his long-suffering, for an example of those who should thereafter believe on him to eternal life.

17. Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

18. This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may war the good warfare;

19. holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:

20. of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.

## 1 Timothy 2

1. I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;

2. for kings and all who are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.

3. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;

4. who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.

5. For there is [only] one God, and [only] one mediator between God and men, [the] man Christ Jesus,

6. who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony [to be borne] in its own times;

7. to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I don't lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

8. I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.

9. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;

10. but (which becomes women professing godliness) through good works.

11. Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.

12. But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.

13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve;

14. and Adam wasn't beguiled, but the woman being beguiled has fallen into transgression:

15. but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they stay in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.

## 1 Timothy 3

1. Faithful is the saying, If a man seeks the office of overseer, he desires a good work.

2. The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach;

3. no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;

4. one who rules well his own house, having [his] children in subjection with all gravity;

5. (but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?)

6. not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

7. Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

8. Servants in like manner [must be] grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of monetary gain;

9. holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

10. And let these also first be proved; then let them serve, if they are blameless.

11. Women in like manner [must be] grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.

12. Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and their own houses well.

13. For they having served well gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

14. These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;

15. but if I tarry long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

16. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; He who was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the spirit, Seen of angels, Preached among the nations, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.

## 1 Timothy 4

1. But the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some will fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,

2. through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;

3. forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

4. For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving:

5. for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.

6. If you put the brothers in mind of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed [until now]:

7. but refuse profane and old wives' fables. And exercise yourself to godliness:

8. for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.

9. Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance.

10. For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

11. These things command and teach.

12. Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.

13. Until I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.

14. Don't neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the group of elders.

15. Be diligent in these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your progress may be manifest to all.

16. Take heed to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Don't rebuke an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers:

2. the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.

3. Honor widows who are widows indeed.

4. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety toward their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.

5. Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.

6. But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.

7. These things also command, that they may be without reproach.

8. But if any does not provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.

9. Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, [having been] the wife of one man,

10. well reported of for good works; if she has brought up children, if she has used hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.

11. But younger widows refuse: for when their sexual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they desire to marry;

12. having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.

13. And besides they learn also [to be] idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

14. I desire therefore that the younger [widows] marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling:

15. for some already turned aside after Satan.

16. If any woman who believes has widows, let her relieve them, and don't let the church be burdened; that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.

17. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.

18. For the Scripture says, You will not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn. And, The worker is worthy of his wages.

19. Against an elder don't receive an accusation, except on [the basis of] two or three witnesses.

20. Those who sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.

21. I charge [you] in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.

22. Lay hands hastily on no man, neither share in other men's sins: keep yourself pure.

23. Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.

24. Some men's sins are evident, going before to judgment; and some men also they follow after.

25. In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such that are otherwise can't be hid.

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let as many as are slaves under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.

2. And those who have believing masters, don't let them despise them, because they are brothers; but let them serve as better slaves, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort.

3. If any man teaches a different doctrine, and does not consent to sound words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;

4. he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, from which comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

5. wranglings of men corrupted in mind and defrauded of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.

6. But godliness with contentment is great gain:

7. for we brought nothing into the world, neither can we carry anything out;

8. but having food and covering we will be content with this.

9. But those who are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful desires, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.

10. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11. But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

12. Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.

13. I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;

14. that you keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

15. which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

16. who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honor and power eternal. Amen.

17. Charge those who are rich in this present age, not to be highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;

18. that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

19. laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is [life] indeed.

20. O Timothy, guard that which is committed to [you], turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;

21. which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you{+}.
