# Acts

## Acts 1

1. The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,

2. until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen:

3. To whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:

4. and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, [he said], you{+} heard from me:

5. For John indeed baptized in water; but you{+} will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.

6. They therefore, when they had come together, asked him, saying, Lord, do you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. And he said to them, It is not for you{+} to know times or seasons, which the Father has set in his own authority.

8. But you{+} will receive power, when the Holy Spirit has come upon you{+}: and you{+} will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.

9. And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

10. And while they were looking steadfastly into heaven as he went, look, two men stood by them in white apparel;

11. who also said, Men, Galileans, why do you{+} stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was received up from you{+} into heaven will so come in like manner as you{+} watched him going into heaven.

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called, of Olive, which is near to Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey off.

13. And when they had come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas [the son] of James.

14. These all with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer, with the women, and [with] Mary the mother of Jesus, and [with] his brothers.

15. And in these days Peter stood up among the brothers, and said (and there was a multitude of names of about a hundred and twenty in all),

16. Men, brothers, it was needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.

17. For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this service.

18. (Now this man obtained a field with the wages of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.

19. And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their own language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)

20. For it is written in the Book of Psalms, Let his habitation be made desolate, And let no man dwell in it. And, His office of oversight let another take.

21. Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,

22. beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.

23. And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom you have chosen,

25. to take the place in this service and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.

26. And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And when the day of Pentecost had now come, they were all together in one place.

2. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And there appeared to them tongues separating apart, like of fire; and it sat on each one of them.

4. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5. Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.

6. And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.

7. And they were amazed and marveled, saying, Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?

8. And how do we each hear in our own language in which we were born?

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,

10. in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome,

11. both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.

12. And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What does this mean?

13. But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.

14. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke forth to them, [saying], Men, Jews, and all you{+} who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you{+}, and give ear to my words.

15. For these are not drunk, as you{+} suppose; seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day.

16. But this is that which has been spoken through the prophet Joel:

17. And it will be in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh: And your{+} sons and your{+} daughters will prophesy, And your{+} young men will see visions, And your{+} old men will dream dreams:

18. Yes and on my male slaves and on my female slaves in those days I will pour forth of my Spirit; and they will prophesy.

19. And I will show wonders in the heaven above, And signs on the earth beneath; Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:

20. The sun will be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord comes, That great and notable [day].

21. And it will be, that everyone who will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.

22. Men, Israelites, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God to you{+} by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you{+}, even as you{+} yourselves know;

23. him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you{+} by the hand of lawless men crucified and slew:

24. whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.

25. For David says concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face; For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:

26. Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope:

27. Because you will not leave my soul to Hades, Neither will you give your Holy One to see corruption.

28. You made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with your countenance.

29. Men, brothers, I may say to you{+} freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.

30. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set [one] on his throne;

31. he foreseeing [this] spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

32. This Jesus, God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.

33. Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you{+} both see and hear.

34. For David did not ascend into the heavens: but he says himself, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,

35. Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.

36. Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you{+} crucified.

37. Now when they heard [this,] they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men, brothers, what shall we do?

38. And Peter says to them, Repent{+}, and be baptized each of you{+} in the name of Jesus Christ to the remission of your{+} sins; and you{+} will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For to you{+} is the promise, and to your{+} children, and to all who are far off, [even] as many as Yahweh our God will call to him.

40. And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.

41. Then they who received his word were baptized: and there were added [to them] in that day about three thousand souls.

42. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.

43. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.

44. And all who believed were together, and had all things common;

45. and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according to as any man had need.

46. And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,

47. praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those who were saved.

## Acts 3

1. Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour].

2. And a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who entered into the temple;

3. who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.

4. And Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, Look at us.

5. And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. But Peter said, Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

7. And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his anklebones received strength.

8. And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

10. and they took knowledge of him, that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.

11. And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.

12. And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, Men, Israelites, why do you{+} marvel at this man? Or why do you{+} fasten your{+} eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?

13. The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you{+} delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.

14. But you{+} denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a man [who was] a murderer to be granted to you{+},

15. and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; of which we are witnesses.

16. And by faith in his name has his name made this man strong, whom you{+} see and know: yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of all of you{+}.

17. And now, brothers, I know that in ignorance you{+} participated in it, as also did your{+} rulers.

18. But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.

19. Repent{+} therefore, and turn again, that your{+} sins may be blotted out;

20. so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ who has been appointed for you{+}, [even] Jesus:

21. whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old.

22. Moses indeed said, A prophet will Yahweh your{+} God raise up to you{+} from among your{+} brothers, like me. To him you{+} will listen in all things whatever he will speak to you{+}.

23. And it will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet, will be completely destroyed from among the people.

24. Yes and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.

25. You{+} are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your{+} fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.

26. To you{+} first, God having raised up his Son, sent him to bless you{+}, in turning away each [of you{+}] from your{+} iniquities.

## Acts 4

1. And as they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,

2. being very troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3. And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward to the next day: for it was now evening.

4. But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about 5,000.

5. And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;

6. and Annas the high priest [was there], and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.

7. And when they had set them in the middle [of the Council], they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have you{+} done this?

8. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, You{+} rulers of the people, and elders,

9. if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to a lame man, how this man is made whole;

10. be it known to all of you{+}, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you{+} crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] in him does this man stand here before you{+} whole.

11. He is the stone which was set at nothing of you{+} the builders, which was made the head of the corner.

12. And in no other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, in which we must be saved.

13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

14. And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

15. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,

16. saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has happened through them, is manifest to all who dwell in Jerusalem; and we can't deny it.

17. But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak from now on to no man in this name.

18. And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you{+} rather than to God, you{+} judge:

20. for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.

21. And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.

22. For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing happened.

23. And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.

24. And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Sovereign Yahweh, you who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them:

25. who by the Holy Spirit, [by] the mouth of our father David your son, said, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?

26. The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed.

27. For of a truth in this city against your holy Son Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,

28. to do whatever your hand and your counsel predetermined to come to pass.

29. And now, Lord, look at their threatenings: and grant to your slaves to speak your word with all boldness,

30. while you stretch forth your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Son Jesus.

31. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.

32. And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul: and not one [of them] said that anything of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.

33. And with great power the apostles gave their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was on them all.

34. For neither was there among them any who lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,

35. and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made to each, according to as anyone had need.

36. And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,

37. having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.

## Acts 5

1. But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,

2. and kept back [part] of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land?

4. While it stayed [unsold], did it not stay yours? And after it was sold, was it not in your power? How is it that you have conceived this matter in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.

5. And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all who heard it.

6. And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.

7. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.

8. And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether you{+} sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.

9. But Peter [said] to her, How is it that you{+} have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.

10. And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.

11. And great fear came upon the whole church, and on all who heard these things.

12. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders happening among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.

13. But of the rest no man dared stick [close] to them: nevertheless the people magnified them;

14. and what's more, believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;

15. insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.

16. And there also came together the multitudes from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and those who were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.

17. But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,

18. and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.

19. But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,

20. Go{+}, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.

21. And when they heard [this], they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the Sanhedrin together, and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.

22. But the attendants that came didn't find them in the prison; and they returned, and told,

23. saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man inside.

24. Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them to what this would grow.

25. And there came one and told them, Look, the men whom you{+} put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.

26. Then the captain went with the attendants, and brought them, [but] without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.

27. And when they had brought them, they set them before the Sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,

28. saying, Didn't we strictly charge you{+} not to teach in this name? And look, you{+} have filled Jerusalem with your{+} teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us.

29. But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you{+} slew, hanging him on a tree.

31. God exalted him with his right hand [to be] a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.

32. And we are witnesses of these things; and [so is] the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.

33. But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and minded to slay them.

34. But there stood up one in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, highly honored by all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.

35. And he said to them, Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves as concerning these men, what you{+} are about to participate in.

36. For before these days Theudas rose up, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.

37. After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away [some of the] people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.

38. And now I say to you{+}, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown:

39. but if it is of God, you{+} will not be able to overthrow them; lest perhaps you{+} are found even to be fighting against God. So they were persuaded by him.

40. And when they had called the apostles to them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41. They therefore departed from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name.

42. And every day, in the temple and at home, they did not cease to teach and to preach [the good news of] Christ Jesus.

## Acts 6

1. Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.

2. And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God to serve tables.

3. But, brothers, find{+} seven men of good report from among you{+}, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

4. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer, and in the service of the word.

5. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;

6. whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

7. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

8. And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.

9. But there arose certain of those who were of the synagogue called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.

10. And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.

11. Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and [against] God.

12. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the Sanhedrin,

13. and set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease to speak words against this holy place, and the law:

14. for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.

15. And all who sat in the Sanhedrin, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

## Acts 7

1. And the high priest said, Are these things so?

2. And he said, Men, brothers and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,

3. and said to him, Get out of your land, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I will show you.

4. Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from there, when his father was dead, [God] removed him into this land, in which you{+} now dwell:

5. and he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when [as yet] he had no child.

6. And God spoke on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should make them slaves, and treat them ill, four hundred years.

7. And I will judge the nation to which they will serve as slaves, God said: and after that they will come forth, and serve me in this place.

8. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so [Abraham] begot Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac [begot] Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,

10. and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and over all his house.

11. Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.

12. But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.

13. And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers; and Joseph's race became manifest to Pharaoh.

14. And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

15. And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;

16. and they were carried over to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.

17. But as the time of the promise drew near which God assured to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

18. until there arose another king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.

19. The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babies to the end they might not live.

20. At which season Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair; and he was nourished three months in his father's house.

21. And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.

22. And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.

23. But when he was well-near forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the sons of Israel.

24. And seeing one [of them] suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian:

25. and he supposed that his brothers understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they didn't understand.

26. And the day following he appeared to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Men, you{+} are brothers; why do you{+} wrong one another?

27. But he who did his fellow man wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?

29. And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.

30. And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.

31. And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to look, there came a voice of the Lord,

32. I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and did not dare look.

33. And the Lord said to him, Loose the sandals from your feet: for the place on which you stand is holy ground.

34. I have surely seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send you into Egypt.

35. This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? God has sent him [to be] both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.

36. This man led them forth, having done wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.

37. This is that Moses, who said to the sons of Israel, God will raise up to you{+} a prophet from among your{+} brothers, like me.

38. This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give to us:

39. to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,

40. saying to Aaron, Make us gods that will go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.

41. And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.

42. But God turned, and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the Book of the Prophets, Did you{+} offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

43. And you{+} took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of your god Rephan, The figures which you{+} made to worship them: And I will carry you{+} away beyond Babylon.

44. Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spoke to Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.

45. Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;

46. who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the house of Jacob.

47. But Solomon built him a house.

48. Nevertheless the Most High does not dwell in [houses] made with hands; as the prophet says,

49. The heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool of my feet: What manner of house will you{+} build me? says the Lord: Or what is the place of my rest?

50. Did not my hand make all these things?

51. You{+} stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you{+} always resist the Holy Spirit: as your{+} fathers did, so do you{+}.

52. Which of the prophets did your{+} fathers not persecute? And they killed those who showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom you{+} have now become traitors and murderers;

53. you{+} who received the law as it was appointed by angels, and did not keep it.

54. Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.

55. But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,

56. and said, Look, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.

57. But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed on him with one accord;

58. and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen, calling on and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was giving approval to his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.

3. But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women delivered them to prison.

4. They therefore who were scattered abroad, went about preaching [the good news of] the word.

5. And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.

6. And the multitudes gave heed with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.

7. For [from] many of those who had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many who were palsied, and who were lame, were healed.

8. And there was much joy in that city.

9. But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who formerly in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

10. to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.

11. And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.

12. But when they believed Philip preaching [the good news] concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13. And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and watching signs and great miracles happening, he was amazed.

14. Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:

15. who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:

16. for as yet it had fallen on none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,

19. saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay my hands, he may receive the Spirit.

20. But Peter said to him, May your silver with you be destroyed, because you have thought to obtain the gift of God with money.

21. You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right before God.

22. Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of your heart will be forgiven you.

23. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.

24. And Simon answered and said, You{+} pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you{+} have spoken come upon me.

25. They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.

26. But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert.

27. And he arose and went: and look, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;

28. and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.

29. And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and stick [close] to this chariot.

30. And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Do you understand what you read?

31. And he said, How can I, except some one will guide me? And he implored Philip to come up and sit with him.

32. Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is mute, So he does not open his mouth:

33. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who will declare? For his life is taken from the earth.

34. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom does the prophet speak this? Of himself, or of some other?

35. And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him [the good news of] Jesus.

36. And as they went on the way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch says, Look, [here is] water; what does hinder me to be baptized?

37. []

38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.

39. And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the good news to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.

## Acts 9

1. But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,

2. and asked of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew near to Damascus: and suddenly there shone around him a light out of heaven:

4. and he fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

5. And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he [said], I am Jesus whom you persecute:

6. but rise, and enter into the city, and it will be told you what you must do.

7. And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no man.

8. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.

9. And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.

10. Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Look, I [am here], Lord.

11. And the Lord [said] to him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for look, he prays;

12. and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.

13. But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem:

14. and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.

15. But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before Gentiles and kings, and [the] sons of Israel:

16. for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake.

17. And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] Jesus, who appeared to you in the way which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

18. And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;

19. and he took food and was strengthened. And he was some days with the disciples who were at Damascus.

20. And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, He is the Son of God.

21. And all who heard him were amazed, and said, Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.

22. But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.

23. And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:

24. but their plot became known to Saul. But they were also watching the gates, both day and night, that they might kill him:

25. but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.

26. And when he came to Jerusalem, he assayed to stick [close] to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem,

29. preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spoke and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.

30. And when the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

31. So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.

32. And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.

33. And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.

34. And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you: arise and make your bed. And immediately he arose.

35. And all who dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.

36. Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.

37. And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.

38. And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, entreating him, Do not delay to come through to us.

39. And Peter arose and went with them. And when he came, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

40. But Peter put them all forth, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

41. And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.

42. And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.

43. And it came to pass, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. Now [there was] a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a captain from the Italian Battalion,

2. a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.

3. He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.

4. And he, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have gone up for a memorial before God.

5. And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:

6. he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.

7. And when the angel that spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household slaves, and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually;

8. and having rehearsed all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.

9. Now on the next day, as they were on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:

10. and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;

11. and he looks at heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners on the earth:

12. in which were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.

13. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.

14. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.

15. And a voice [came] to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, don't make common.

16. And this was done thrice: and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.

17. Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might be, look, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,

18. and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.

19. And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Look, three men are seeking you.

20. But arise, and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.

21. And Peter went down to the men, and said, Look, I am he whom you{+} seek: what is the cause why you{+} have come?

22. And they said, Captain Cornelius, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned [of God] by a holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words from you.

23. So he called them in and lodged them. And on the next day he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

24. And on the next day he entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends.

25. And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.

26. But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.

27. And as he talked with him, he went in, and finds many come together:

28. and he said to them, You{+} yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to stick [close] to or come to one of another nation; and [yet] to me has God shown that I should not call any man common or unclean:

29. therefore also I came without opposing, when I was sent for. I ask, therefore, what [is the] reason you{+} sent for me?

30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and look, a man stood before me in bright apparel,

31. and says, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.

32. Send therefore to Joppa, and call to you Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside.

33. Forthwith therefore I sent to you; and you have well done that you have come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded you of the Lord.

34. And Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:

35. but in every nation he who fears him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to him.

36. The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ [saying that], He is Lord of all.

37. That saying you{+} yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;

38. [even] Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.

40. God raised him up on the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before of God, [even] to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.

42. And he charged us to preach to the people, and to testify that this is he who is appointed of God [to be] the Judge of the living and the dead.

43. To him all the prophets bear witness, that through his name everyone who believes on him will receive remission of sins.

44. While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.

45. And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.

46. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then Peter answered,

47. Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?

48. And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they prayed him to tarry some days.

## Acts 11

1. Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.

2. And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,

3. saying, You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them.

4. But Peter began, and expounded [the matter] to them in order, saying,

5. I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:

6. on which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.

7. And I heard also a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.

8. But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.

9. But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, don't make common.

10. And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.

11. And look, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea to me.

12. And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brothers also accompanied me; and we entered into the man's house:

13. and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;

14. who will speak to you words, by which you will be saved, you and all your house.

15. And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us in the beginning.

16. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized in water; but you{+} will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.

17. If then God gave to them the like gift as [he did] also to us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?

18. And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also has God granted repentance to life.

19. They therefore who were scattered abroad on the tribulation that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except only to Jews.

20. But there were some of them, men, Cyprians and Cyreneans, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecian Jews also, preaching [the good news of] the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned to the Lord.

22. And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch:

23. who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would continue in the Lord:

24. for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added to the Lord.

25. And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;

26. and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught many people, and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

27. Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.

29. And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send help to the brothers who dwelt in Judea:

30. which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.

2. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

3. And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And [those] were the days of unleavened bread.

4. And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four groups of four soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.

5. Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church to God for him.

6. And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.

7. And look, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he struck Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

8. And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and fasten on your sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Cast your garment about you, and follow me.

9. And he went out, and followed; and he didn't know that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.

10. And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.

11. And when Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord has sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. And when he had considered [the thing], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.

13. And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a female slave came to answer, named Rhoda.

14. And when she knew Peter's voice, she didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.

15. And they said to her, You are insane. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.

16. But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.

17. But he, beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things to James, and to the brothers. And he departed, and went to another place.

18. Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.

19. And when Herod had sought for him, and did not find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and spent some time there.

20. Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king's country.

21. And on a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration to them.

22. And the people shouted, [saying], The voice of a god, and not of a man.

23. And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

24. But the word of God grew and multiplied.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.

## Acts 13

1. Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was [there], prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

2. And as they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.

3. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.

4. So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

5. And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.

6. And when they had gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a man [who was] a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus;

7. who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called to him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.

8. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.

9. But Saul, who is also [called] Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,

10. and said, O full of all guile and all villany, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

11. And now, look, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

12. Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

13. Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.

14. But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.

15. And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if you{+} have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

16. And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men, Israelites, and you{+} who fear God, listen:

17. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.

18. And for about the time of forty years as a foster-father he bore them in the wilderness.

19. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave [them] their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:

20. and after these things he gave [them] judges until Samuel the prophet.

21. And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.

22. And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bore witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.

23. Of this man's seed has God according to promise brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus;

24. when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

25. And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What do you{+} suppose that I am? I am not [he]. But look, there comes one after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.

26. Men, brothers, sons of the stock of Abraham, and those among you{+} who fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.

27. For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled [them] by condemning [him].

28. And though they found no cause of death [in him], yet they asked of Pilate that he should be slain.

29. And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.

30. But God raised him from the dead:

31. and he was seen for many days of those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.

32. And we bring you{+} good news of the promise made to the fathers,

33. that God has fulfilled these things to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day I have begotten you.

34. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken on this wise, I will give you{+} the holy and sure [blessings] of David.

35. Because he says also in another [psalm], You will not give Your Holy One to see corruption.

36. For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:

37. but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.

38. Be it known to you{+} therefore, men, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you{+} remission of sins, and from all things which you{+} could not be justified by the law of Moses.

39. By this man everyone who believes is justified.

40. Beware therefore, lest that come upon [you{+}] which is spoken in the prophets:

41. Look, you{+} despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your{+} days, A work which you{+} will in no way believe, if one declares it to you{+}.

42. And as they went out, they implored that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.

43. Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.

44. And the next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.

45. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.

46. And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you{+}. Seeing you{+} thrust it from you{+}, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, look, we turn to the Gentiles.

47. For so has the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, That you should be for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth.

48. And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.

49. And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.

50. But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.

51. But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 14

1. And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.

2. But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brothers.

3. Therefore they spent a long time [there], speaking boldly in the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

4. But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.

5. And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,

6. they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region:

7. and there they preached the good news.

8. And at Lystra there sat a certain man, lame in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who had never walked.

9. The same heard Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,

10. said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up and walked.

11. And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.

12. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.

13. And the priest of Jupiter whose [temple] was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have sacrificed with the multitudes.

14. But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out

15. and saying, Sirs, why do you{+} do these things? We also are men of like passions with you{+}, and bring you{+} good news, that you{+} should turn from these useless things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them:

16. who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.

17. And yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you{+} from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your{+} hearts with food and gladness.

18. And with these sayings they scarcely restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them.

19. But there came Jews there from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.

20. But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the next day he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. And when they had preached the good news to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,

22. confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.

23. And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.

24. And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.

25. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;

26. and from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been delivered to [the care of] the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.

27. And when they had come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. And they spent not a little time with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, [saying], Except you{+} are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you{+} can't be saved.

2. And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, [the brothers] appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.

3. They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.

4. And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.

5. But there rose up some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.

6. And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.

7. And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men, brothers, you{+} know that a good while ago God chose among you{+}, that by my mouth the Gentiles were to hear the word of the good news, and to believe.

8. And God, who knows the heart, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us;

9. and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.

10. Now therefore why do you{+} make trial of God, that you{+} should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

11. But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.

12. And all the multitude kept silent; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.

13. And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me:

14. Symeon has rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

15. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

16. After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen; And I will build again its ruins, And I will set it up:

17. That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, on whom my name is called, says the Lord, [who is] doing these things

18. [as they were] known from of old.

19. Therefore my judgment is, that we not trouble those who from among the Gentiles turn to God;

20. but that we write to them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.

21. For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.

22. Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers:

23. and they wrote [thus] by them, The apostles and the elders, brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings:

24. Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you{+} with words, subverting your{+} souls; to whom we gave no commandment;

25. it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you{+} with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. men who have delivered up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will tell you{+} the same things by word of mouth.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay on you{+} no greater burden than these necessary things:

29. that you{+} abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if you{+} keep yourselves, you{+} will do reasonably well. Take care.

30. So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.

31. And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.

32. And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.

33. And after they had been [there] for some time, they were dismissed in peace from the brothers to those who had sent them forth.

34. []

35. But Paul and Barnabas spent time in Antioch, teaching and preaching [the good news of] the word of the Lord, with many others also.

36. And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they fare.

37. And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.

38. But Paul thought it not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to the work.

39. And there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated apart one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus;

40. but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being delivered to [the care of] the grace of the Lord by the brothers.

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

## Acts 16

1. And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and look, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who believed; but his father was a Greek.

2. The same was well reported of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium.

3. Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

4. And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been determined by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.

5. So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.

6. And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;

7. and when they had come across from Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;

8. and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.

9. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing and imploring him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.

10. And when he had seen the vision, right away we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the good news to them.

11. And setting sail from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;

12. and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a [Roman] colony: and we were spending some days in this city.

13. And on the Sabbath day we went forth outside the gate by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.

14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things which were spoken by Paul.

15. And when she was baptized, and her household, she implored us, saying, If you{+} have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay [there]. And she constrained us.

16. And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain female slave having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune-telling.

17. The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you{+} the way of salvation.

18. And this she did for many days. But Paul, being very troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.

19. But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,

20. and when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,

21. and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.

22. And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.

23. And when they had laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

24. who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

25. But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;

26. and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bands were loosed.

27. And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

28. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do nothing to harm yourself: for we are all here.

29. And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,

30. and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house.

32. And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, with all who were in his house.

33. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.

34. And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.

35. But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.

36. And the jailor reported these words to Paul, [saying], The magistrates have sent to let you{+} go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No truly; but let them come themselves and bring us out.

38. And the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;

39. and they came and implored them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.

40. And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house] of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.

## Acts 17

1. Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:

2. and Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

3. opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that Jesus, whom I proclaim to you{+}, is the Christ.

4. And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.

5. But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took to them certain vile men of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.

6. And when they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying out, These who have turned the world upside down have come here also;

7. whom Jason has received: and, contrary to the decrees of Caesar, these all take part in another king who they are saying to be Jesus.

8. And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.

9. And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.

10. And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who when they had come there went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.

12. Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.

13. But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Berea also, they came there likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.

14. And then immediately the brothers sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy stayed there still.

15. But those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.

16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked inside him as he looked at the city full of idols.

17. So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.

18. And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? Others, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached [the good news of] Jesus and the resurrection.

19. And they took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?

20. For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.

21. (Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)

22. And Paul stood among the Areopagus, and said, Men, Atheneans, in all things, I perceive that you{+} are very religious.

23. For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your{+} worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you{+} worship in ignorance, this I set forth to you{+}.

24. The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;

25. neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things;

26. and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined [their] appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;

27. that they should seek God, if perhaps they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:

28. for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your{+} own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.

29. Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.

30. The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commands men that they should all everywhere repent:

31. inasmuch as he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed; he has given assurance of this to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.

32. Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear you concerning this yet again.

33. Thus Paul went out from among them.

34. But certain men stuck [close] to him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

## Acts 18

1. After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.

2. And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came to them;

3. and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them, and he worked, for by their trade they were tentmakers.

4. And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.

5. But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.

6. And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said to them, Your{+} blood [be] on your{+} own heads; I am clean: from now on I will go to the Gentiles.

7. And he departed from there, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

8. And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

9. And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, Don't be afraid, but speak and don't hold your peace:

10. for I am with you, and no man will set on you to harm you: for I have many people in this city.

11. And he dwelt [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

12. But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,

13. saying, This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.

14. But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O you{+} Jews, there would be a reason that I should bear with you{+}:

15. but if they are questions about words and names and your{+} own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.

16. And he drove them from the judgment-seat.

17. And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.

18. And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.

19. And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

20. And when they asked him to stay a longer time, he did not consent;

21. but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again to you{+} if God wills, he set sail from Ephesus.

22. And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.

23. And having spent some time [there], he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.

24. Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.

25. This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:

26. and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more accurately.

27. And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he came, he helped them much that had believed through grace;

28. for he powerfully confuted the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

## Acts 19

1. And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came down to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:

2. and he said to them, Did you{+} receive the Holy Spirit when you{+} believed? And they [said] to him, No, we did not even hear whether the Holy Spirit was [given].

3. And he said, Into what then were you{+} baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.

4. And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Jesus.

5. And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.

7. And they were in all about twelve men.

8. And he entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading [as to] the things concerning the kingdom of God.

9. But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.

10. And this continued for the space of two years; so that all those who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

11. And God did special miracles by the hands of Paul:

12. insomuch that to the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.

13. But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took on them to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you{+} by Jesus whom Paul preaches.

14. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.

15. And the evil spirit answered and said to them, Jesus I know, and Paul I am aware of, but who are you{+}?

16. And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

17. And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their activities.

19. And not a few of those who participated in magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it was $1 Million.

20. So, by the power of the Lord, the word kept spreading and growing stronger.

21. Now after these things had ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.

22. And having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained in Asia for a while.

23. And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.

24. For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen;

25. whom he gathered together, with the workers of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you{+} know that by this business we have our wealth.

26. And you{+} see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:

27. and not only is there danger that this trade of ours come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worships.

28. And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesus.

29. And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's travel companions.

30. And when Paul was minded to enter in to the people, the disciples did not allow him.

31. And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and implored him not to adventure himself into the theatre.

32. Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and most didn't know why they had come together.

33. And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense to the people.

34. But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.

35. And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he says, Men, Ephesians, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?

36. Seeing then that these things can't be opposed, you{+} ought to be quiet, and to participate in nothing rash.

37. For you{+} have brought [here] these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.

38. If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.

39. But if you{+} seek after something more, it will be settled in the regular assembly.

40. For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause [for it]: and as concerning it we will not be able to give account of this concourse. And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

## Acts 20

1. And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, said his goodbyes and departed to go into Macedonia.

2. And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.

3. And when he had spent three months [there,] and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.

4. And there accompanied him: Sopater of Berea, [the son] of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

5. But these had gone before, and stayed [waiting] for us at Troas.

6. And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.

7. And on the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the next day; and prolonged his speech until midnight.

8. And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.

9. And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.

10. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Don't be{+} distressed; for his life is in him.

11. And when he had gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, so he departed.

12. And they brought the boy alive, and were not a little comforted.

13. But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.

14. And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.

15. And sailing from there, we came the following day across from Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying, if it might be possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

17. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.

18. And when they had come to him, he said to them, You{+} yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you{+} all the time,

19. serving as a slave to the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;

20. how I did not shrink from declaring to you{+} anything that was profitable, and teaching you{+} publicly, and from house to house,

21. testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.

22. And now, look, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will befall me there:

23. except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But I don't hold my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.

25. And now, look, I know that all of you{+}, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more.

26. Therefore I testify to you{+} this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.

27. For I did not shrink from declaring to you{+} the whole counsel of God.

28. Take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you{+} overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood.

29. I know that after my departing grievous wolves will enter in among you{+}, not sparing the flock;

30. and from among your{+} own selves will men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.

31. Therefore watch{+}, remembering that by the space of three years I did not cease to admonish each one [of you{+}] night and day with tears.

32. And now I commend you{+} to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build [you{+}] up, and to give [you{+}] the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

33. I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

34. You{+} yourselves know that these hands served to my necessities, and to those who were with me.

35. In all things I gave you{+} an example, that so laboring you{+} ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

36. And when he had thus spoken, having knelt down with them all, he prayed.

37. And they all wept intensely, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,

38. sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him on his way to the ship.

## Acts 21

1. And when it came to pass that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara:

2. and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.

3. And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.

4. And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.

5. And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and all of them, including women and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed;

6. and said our goodbyes to each other; and we went onboard the ship, but they returned home again.

7. And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.

8. And on the next day we departed, and came to Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.

9. Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.

10. And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus.

11. And coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place implored him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. Then Paul answered, What do you{+} do, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

15. And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.

16. And there went with us also [certain] of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing [with them] one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.

17. And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.

18. And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.

19. And when he had greeted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his service.

20. And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said to him, You see, brother, how many tens of thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:

21. and they have been informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.

22. What is it therefore? They will certainly hear that you have come.

23. Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on them;

24. these take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that there is no truth in the things of which they have been informed concerning you; but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.

25. But as concerning the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.

26. Then Paul took the men the next day, having been purified with them, [and] went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.

27. And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,

28. crying out, Men, Israelites, help: This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and has defiled this holy place.

29. For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.

30. And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.

31. And as they were seeking to kill him, news came up to the Colonel of the Battalion, All Jerusalem is in confusion.

32. And forthwith he took soldiers and captains, and ran down on them: and they, when they saw the colonel and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.

33. Then the colonel came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.

34. And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.

35. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;

36. for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.

37. And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he says to the colonel, May I say something to you? And he said, Do you know Greek?

38. Are you not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?

39. But Paul said, I am a Jewish man, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I urge you, give me leave to speak to the people.

40. And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand to the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,

## Acts 22

1. Men: brothers and fathers, hear{+} the defense which I now make to you{+}.

2. And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he says,

3. I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, instructed at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God even as all of you{+} are this day:

4. and I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.

5. As also the high priest bears me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.

6. And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew near to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light around me.

7. And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

8. And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.

9. And those who were with me indeed saw the light, but they didn't hear the voice of him who spoke to me.

10. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it will be told you of all things which are appointed for you to do.

11. And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me I came into Damascus.

12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,

13. came to me, and standing by me said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.

14. And he said, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.

15. For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.

16. And now why do you tarry? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.

17. And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,

18. and saw him saying to me, Hurry, and get quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of you testimony concerning me.

19. And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed on you:

20. and when the blood of Stephen your witness was shed, I also was standing by, and giving approval, and keeping the garments of those who slew him.

21. And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you forth far from here to the Gentiles.

22. And they gave him audience to this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

23. And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,

24. the colonel commanded him to be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.

25. And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the captain that stood by, Is it lawful for you{+} to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?

26. And when the captain heard it, he went to the colonel and told him, saying, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.

27. And the colonel came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.

28. And the colonel answered, With a great sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am [a Roman] born.

29. They then who were about to examine him immediately departed from him: and the colonel also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

30. But on the next day, desiring to know the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.

## Acts 23

1. And Paul, looking steadfastly on the Sanhedrin, said, Men, brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.

2. And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.

3. Then said Paul to him, God will strike you, you whited wall: and do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?

4. And those who stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest?

5. And Paul said, I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest: for it is written, You will not speak evil of a ruler of your people.

6. But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.

7. And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.

8. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.

9. And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?

10. And when there arose a great dissension, the colonel, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.

11. And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as you have testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.

12. And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

13. And there were more than forty that made this conspiracy.

14. And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.

15. Now therefore you{+} with the Sanhedrin signify to the colonel that he bring him down to you{+}, as though you{+} would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.

16. But Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.

17. And Paul called to him one of the captains, and said, Bring this young man to the colonel; for he has something to tell him.

18. So he took him, and brought him to the colonel, and says, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.

19. And the colonel took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that you have to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though you would inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.

21. You, therefore, should not yield to them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink until they have slain him: and now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.

22. So the colonel let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that you have signified these things to me.

23. And he called to him two of the captains, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:

24. and [he bade them] provide beasts, that they might set Paul on them, and bring him safe to Felix the governor.

25. And he wrote a letter after this form:

26. Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.

27. This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.

28. And desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin:

29. whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.

30. And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak the things against him before you.

31. So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:

33. and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.

34. And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,

35. I will hear you fully, he said, when your accusers also have come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.

## Acts 24

1. And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and [with] an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.

2. And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,

3. we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. But, that I not be further tedious to you, I entreat you to hear us of your clemency a few words.

5. For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

6. who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:

7. []

8. from whom you will be able, by examining him yourself, to take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him.

9. And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.

10. And when the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, Since I know that you have been of many years a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:

11. Seeing that you can take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:

12. and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.

13. Neither can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.

14. But this I confess to you, that after the Way which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;

15. having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.

16. In this I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offense toward God and men always.

17. Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:

18. amid which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult:

19. but [there were] certain Jews from Asia, who ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.

20. Otherwise let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,

21. except it is for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you{+} this day.

22. But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Colonel Lysias will come down, I will determine your{+} matter.

23. And he gave order to the captain that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him.

24. But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was Jewish, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.

25. And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go your way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call you to me.

26. He hoped as well that money would be given him of Paul: therefore also he sent for him the more often, and communed with him.

27. But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.

## Acts 25

1. Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.

2. And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they implored him,

3. asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.

4. Nevertheless Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart [there] shortly.

5. Let them therefore, he says, who are of power among you{+} go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.

6. And when he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.

7. And when he came, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;

8. while Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.

9. But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?

10. But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews I have done no wrong, as you also very well know.

11. If then I am a wrongdoer, and have participated in anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is [true] of which these accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.

12. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar: to Caesar you will go.

13. Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea saluting Festus.

14. And as they spent many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;

15. about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], asking for sentence against him.

16. To whom I answered, that it is not Roman custom to give up any man, until the accused has the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.

17. When therefore they had come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.

18. Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;

19. but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

20. And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.

21. But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I should send him to Caesar.

22. And Agrippa [said] to Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he says, you will hear him.

23. So on the next day, when Agrippa came, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the generals and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.

24. And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you{+} see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

25. But I found that he had participated in nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.

26. Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you{+}, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after having the examination, I may have somewhat to write.

27. For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not as well to signify the charges against him.

## Acts 26

1. And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defense:

2. I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews:

3. especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: therefore I urge you to hear me patiently.

4. My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem, all the Jews know;

5. having knowledge of me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now I stand [here] to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God to our fathers;

7. to which [promise] our twelve tribes, earnestly serving [God] night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!

8. Why is it judged incredible with you{+}, if God does raise the dead?

9. I truly thought myself that I ought to participate in many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

10. And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.

11. And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.

12. In which as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,

13. in the middle of the day, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.

14. And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.

15. And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.

16. But arise, and stand on your feet: for to this end I have appeared to you, to appoint you an attendant and a witness both of the things in which you have seen me, and of the things in which I will appear to you;

17. delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,

18. to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.

19. Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:

20. but declared both to them of Damascus first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, participating in works worthy of repentance.

21. For this cause the Jews seized me being in the temple, and assayed to kill me.

22. Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, to this day, I stand testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said should come;

23. how that the Christ must suffer, [and] how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.

24. And as he thus made his defense, Festus says with a loud voice, Paul, you are insane; your much learning is turning you insane.

25. But Paul says, I am not insane, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.

26. For the king knows of these things, to whom I also speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this has not happened in a corner.

27. King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.

28. And Agrippa [said] to Paul, With but little persuasion you would make me a Christian.

29. And Paul [said], I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not you only, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.

30. And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them:

31. and when they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, This man does not participate in anything worthy of death or of bonds.

32. And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.

## Acts 27

1. And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to Captain Julius from the Augustan Battalion.

2. And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.

3. And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends and refresh himself.

4. And putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

5. And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia.

6. And there the captain found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us in it.

7. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty across from Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, across from Salmone;

8. and with difficulty coasting along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens; near to where was the city of Lasea.

9. And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,

10. and said to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the load and the ship, but also of our lives.

11. But the captain gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.

12. And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, most advised to put to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter [there; which is] a haven of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.

13. And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.

14. But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:

15. and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way [to it,] and were driven.

16. And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:

17. and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.

18. And as we exceedingly labored with the storm, the next day they began to throw the [the freight] overboard;

19. and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.

20. And when neither sun nor stars shone on [us] for many days, and no small tempest lay on [us,] all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.

21. And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood among them, and said, Men, you{+} should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.

22. And now I exhort you{+} to be of good cheer; for there will be no loss of life among you{+}, but [only] of the ship.

23. For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom I also serve,

24. saying, Don't be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar: and look, God has granted you all those who sail with you.

25. Therefore, men, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it will be even so as it has been spoken to me.

26. But we must be cast on a certain island.

27. But when the fourteenth night came, as we were driven to and fro in the [sea of] Adria, about the middle of the night the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:

28. and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.

29. And fearing lest perhaps we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.

30. And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,

31. Paul said to the captain and to the soldiers, Except these stay in the ship, you{+} can't be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.

33. And while the day was coming on, Paul implored them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you{+} wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.

34. Therefore I urge you{+} to take some food: for this is for your{+} safety: for there will not a hair perish from the head of any of you{+}.

35. And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he broke it, and began to eat.

36. Then they were all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.

37. And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.

38. And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.

39. And when it was day, they didn't know the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship on it.

40. And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.

41. But having fallen on a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and stayed unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.

42. And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any [of them] should swim out, and escape.

43. But the captain, desiring to save Paul, prevented them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;

44. and the rest, some on planks, and some on [other] things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.

## Acts 28

1. And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.

2. And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.

3. But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

4. And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live.

5. Nevertheless he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.

6. But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and saw nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

7. Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.

8. And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.

9. And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:

10. who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put onboard such things as we needed.

11. And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.

12. And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

13. And from there we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;

14. where we found brothers, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.

15. And from there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

16. And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier that guarded him.

17. And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those who were the chief of the Jews: and when they had come together, he said to them, I, men, brothers, having done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:

18. who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.

19. But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.

20. For this cause therefore I entreated you{+} to see and to speak with [me]: for because of the hope of Israel I have this chain around me.

21. And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any harm of you.

22. But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.

23. And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded [the matter,] testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.

24. And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.

25. And when they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to your{+} fathers,

26. saying, Go to this people, and say, By hearing you{+} will hear, and will in no way understand; And seeing you{+} will see, and will in no way perceive:

27. For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, perhaps they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.

28. Be it known therefore to you{+}, that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles: they will also hear.

29. []

30. And he stayed two whole years in his own rented dwelling, and received all who went in to him,

31. preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.
