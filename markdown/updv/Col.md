# Colossians

## Colossians 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

2. To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ [who are] at Colossae: Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father.

3. We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you{+},

4. having heard of your{+} faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you{+} have toward all the saints,

5. because of the hope which is laid up for you{+} in the heavens, of which you{+} heard before in the word of the truth of the good news,

6. which has come to you{+}; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as [it does] in you{+} also, since the day you{+} heard and knew the grace of God in truth;

7. even as you{+} learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your{+} behalf,

8. who also declared to us your{+} love in the Spirit.

9. For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray and make request for you{+}, that you{+} may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,

10. to walk worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

11. strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, to all patience and long-suffering with joy;

12. giving thanks to the Father, who made you{+} meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;

13. who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;

14. in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:

15. who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;

16. for in him were all things created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and to him;

17. and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.

18. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

19. For it was the good pleasure [of the Father] that in him should all the fullness dwell;

20. and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens.

21. And you{+}, being in time past alienated and enemies in your{+} mind in your{+} evil works,

22. yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you{+} holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:

23. if indeed you{+} continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news which you{+} heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; of which I Paul was made a servant.

24. Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your{+} sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church;

25. of which I was made a servant, according to the dispensation of God which was given me toward you{+}, to fulfill the word of God,

26. [even] the mystery which has been hid since the ages and since the generations: but now it has been manifested to his saints,

27. to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you{+}, the hope of glory:

28. whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;

29. to which I labor also, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.

## Colossians 2

1. For I would have you{+} know how greatly I strive for you{+}, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;

2. that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, [even] Christ,

3. in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.

4. This I say, that no one may delude you{+} with persuasiveness of speech.

5. For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you{+} in the spirit, joying and seeing your{+} order, and the steadfastness of your{+} faith in Christ.

6. As therefore you{+} received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk in him,

7. rooted and built up in him, and established in your{+} faith, even as you{+} were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.

8. Take heed lest there will be anyone who makes spoil of you{+} through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:

9. for in him dwells all the fullness of Deity bodily,

10. and in him you{+} are made full, who is the head of all principality and power:

11. in whom you{+} were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;

12. having been buried with him in baptism, in which you{+} were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.

13. And you{+}, being dead in your{+} trespasses and the uncircumcision of your{+} flesh, you{+}, he made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;

14. having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he has taken it out from between [him and us], nailing it to the cross;

15. having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

16. Let no man therefore judge you{+} in meat and in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day:

17. which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.

18. Let no man rob you{+} of your{+} prize by a voluntary humility and worshiping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has seen, puffed up for nothing by his fleshly mind,

19. and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increasing with the increase of God.

20. If you{+} died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you{+} subject yourselves to ordinances,

21. Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch

22. (all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?

23. Which things indeed have a show of wisdom in do-it-yourself religion, and humility, and severity to the body; [but are] not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.

## Colossians 3

1. If then you{+} were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.

2. Set your{+} mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.

3. For you{+} died, and your{+} life is hid with Christ in God.

4. When Christ will be manifested, [who is] your{+} life, then you{+} will also be manifested with him in glory.

5. Put to death therefore your{+} members which are on the earth: fornication, impurity, immoral sexual passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry;

6. because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience:

7. in which you{+} also once walked, when you{+} lived in these things;

8. but now do you{+} also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your{+} mouth:

9. do not lie one to another; seeing that you{+} have put off the old man with his activities,

10. and have put on the new man, who is being renewed to knowledge after the image of him who created him:

11. where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all things, and in all.

12. Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering;

13. forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you{+}, so also [should] you{+}:

14. and above all these things [put on] love, which is the bond of perfectness.

15. And let the peace of Christ rule in your{+} hearts, to the which you{+} also were called in one body; and be{+} thankful.

16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you{+} richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms [and] hymns [and] spiritual songs, singing with grace in your{+} hearts to God.

17. And whatever you{+} do, in word or in deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

18. Wives, be in subjection to your{+} husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

19. Husbands, love your{+} wives, and do not be bitter against them.

20. Children, obey your{+} parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.

21. Fathers, do not provoke your{+} children, that they not be discouraged.

22. Slaves, obey in all things those who are your{+} masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:

23. whatever you{+} do, work heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;

24. knowing that from the Lord you{+} will receive the recompense of the inheritance: you{+} serve as slaves to the Lord Christ.

25. For he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done: and there is no respect of persons.

## Colossians 4

1. Masters, render to your{+} slaves that which is just and equal; knowing that you{+} also have a Master in heaven.

2. Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving;

3. as well praying for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;

4. that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

5. Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.

6. Let your{+} speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you{+} may know how you{+} ought to answer each one.

7. All my affairs Tychicus will make known to you{+}, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord:

8. whom I have sent you{+} for this very purpose, that you{+} may know our state, and that he may comfort your{+} hearts;

9. together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you{+}. They will make known to you{+} all things that [are done] here.

10. Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner greets you{+}, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you{+} received commandments; if he comes to you{+}, receive him),

11. and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these [are my] only coworkers to the kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.

12. Epaphras, who is one of you{+}, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you{+}, always striving for you{+} in his prayers, that you{+} may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.

13. For I bear him witness, that he has much labor for you{+}, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.

14. Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you{+}.

15. Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in her house.

16. And when this letter has been read among you{+}, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you{+} also read the letter from Laodicea.

17. And say to Archippus, Take heed to the service which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.

18. The salutation of me Paul with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you{+}.
