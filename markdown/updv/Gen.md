# Genesis

## Genesis 1

1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

2. And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

3. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

4. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

5. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.

6. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

7. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

8. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.

9. And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

10. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.

11. And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, in which is their seed, on the earth: and it was so.

12. And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, in which is their seed, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.

13. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.

14. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:

15. and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.

16. And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars.

17. And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth,

18. and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

19. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

20. And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

21. And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.

22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.

23. And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.

25. And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.

26. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

27. And God created the man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

28. And God blessed them: and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.

29. And God said, Look, I have given you{+} every herb yielding seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you{+} it will be for food:

30. and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.

31. And God saw everything that he had made, and, look, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

## Genesis 2

1. And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

2. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

3. And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.

4. These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made earth and heaven.

5. And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth: and the man was not [there] to till the ground;

6. but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.

7. And Yahweh God formed the man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living soul.

8. And Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.

9. And out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.

11. The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which circles the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

12. and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

13. And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that circles the whole land of Cush.

14. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it, which goes in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

15. And Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

16. And Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:

17. but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you will not eat of it: for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.

18. And Yahweh God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make a matching helper for him.

19. And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them to the man to see what he would call them: and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.

20. And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there wasn't found a matching helper for him.

21. And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead of it:

22. and the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man.

23. And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she will be called a woman, because she was taken out of a man.

24. Therefore will a man leave his father and his mother, and will stick to his wife: and they will be one flesh.

25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

## Genesis 3

1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Yahweh God had made. And he said to the woman, has God really said, You{+} will not eat of any tree of the garden?

2. And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:

3. but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You{+} will not eat of it, neither will you{+} touch it, or else you{+} will die.

4. And the serpent said to the woman, You{+} will not surely die:

5. for God knows that in the day you{+} eat of it, then your{+} eyes will be opened, and you{+} will be as God, knowing good and evil.

6. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.

7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

8. And they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.

9. And Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, Where are you?

10. And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

11. And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you that you should not eat?

12. And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.

13. And Yahweh God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.

14. And Yahweh God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly you will go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life:

15. and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: he will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.

16. To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you will bring forth sons; and your desire will be to your husband, and he will rule over you.

17. And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You will not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life;

18. thorns also and thistles it will bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field;

19. in the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust you will return.

20. And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.

21. And Yahweh God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.

22. And Yahweh God said, Look, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, so that he doesn't put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever--

23. therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.

24. So he drove out the man; and he caused the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to stay at the east of the garden of Eden to keep the way of the tree of life.

## Genesis 4

1. And the man had sex with his wife Eve; and she became pregnant, and gave birth to Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Yahweh.

2. And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

3. And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Yahweh.

4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstborns of his flock and of its fat. And Yahweh had respect to Abel and to his offering:

5. but to Cain and to his offering he did not have respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.

6. And Yahweh said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why is your countenance fallen?

7. If you do well, will it not be lifted up? And if you do not well, sin is crouching at the door: and to you will be its desire, but you will rule over it.

8. And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

9. And Yahweh said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I don't know: am I my brother's keeper?

10. And he said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.

11. And now cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;

12. from now on when you till the ground, it will not yield its strength to you; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.

13. And Cain said to Yahweh, My punishment is greater than I can bear.

14. Look, you have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from your face I will be hid; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whoever finds me will slay me.

15. And Yahweh said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should strike him.

16. And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

17. And Cain had sex with his wife; and she became pregnant, and gave birth to Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.

18. And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begot Mehujael: and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech.

19. And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

20. And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.

21. And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.

22. And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

23. And Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; You{+} wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:

24. If Cain will be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

25. And Adam had sex with his wife; and she bore a son, and named him Seth. For, [she said], God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.

26. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he named him Enosh. Then it was begun to call on the name of Yahweh.

## Genesis 5

1. This is the Book of the Generations of Adam. In the day that God created Adam, in the likeness of God he made him;

2. male and female he created them, and blessed them, and called their name Man, in the day when they were created.

3. And Adam lived 130 years, and begot [a son] in his own likeness, after his image; and named him Seth:

4. and the days of Adam after he begot Seth were 800 years: and he begot sons and daughters.

5. And all the days that Adam lived were 930 years: and he died.

6. And Seth lived 105 years, and begot Enosh:

7. and Seth lived after he begot Enosh 807 years, and begot sons and daughters:

8. and all the days of Seth were 912 years: and he died.

9. And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Kenan.

10. And Enosh lived after he begot Kenan 815 years, and begot sons and daughters:

11. and all the days of Enosh were 905 years: and he died.

12. And Kenan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel:

13. and Kenan lived after he begot Mahalalel 840 years, and begot sons and daughters:

14. and all the days of Kenan were 910 years: and he died.

15. And Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared:

16. And Mahalalel lived after he begot Jared 830 years, and begot sons and daughters:

17. and all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years: and he died.

18. And Jared lived 162 years, and begot Enoch:

19. and Jared lived after he begot Enoch 800 years, and begot sons and daughters:

20. And all the days of Jared were 962 years: and he died.

21. And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah:

22. and Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah 300 years, and begot sons and daughters:

23. and all the days of Enoch were 365 years:

24. and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

25. And Methuselah lived 187 years, and begot Lamech:

26. and Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech 782 years, and begot sons and daughters.

27. And all the days of Methuselah were 969 years: and he died.

28. And Lamech lived 182 years, and begot a son:

29. and he named him Noah, saying, This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, [which comes] because of the ground which Yahweh has cursed.

30. And Lamech lived after he begot Noah 595 years, and begot sons and daughters:

31. And all the days of Lamech were 777 years: and he died.

32. And Noah was 500 years old: And Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6

1. And it came to pass, when man began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,

2. that the sons of God saw the daughters of man that they were fair; and they took for themselves wives of all who they chose.

3. And Yahweh said, My spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh: and his days will be 120 years.

4. The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man, and they bore [children] to them: the same were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.

5. And Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

6. And it repented Yahweh that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

7. And Yahweh said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repents me that I have made them.

8. But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.

9. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, [and] perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.

10. And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11. And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

12. And God saw the earth, and, look, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.

13. And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, look, I will destroy them from the earth.

14. Make an ark of gopher wood. You will make the ark with a series of compartments, and will pitch it inside and outside with pitch.

15. And this is how you will make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the width of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

16. You will make a light to the ark, and to a cubit you will finish it upward; and the door of the ark you will set in its side; with lower, second, and third stories you will make it.

17. And I, look, I do bring the flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth will die.

18. But I will establish my covenant with you; and you will come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.

19. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort you will bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they will be male and female.

20. Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive.

21. And you take to yourself of all food that is eaten, and gather it to you; and it will be for food for you, and for them.

22. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.

## Genesis 7

1. And Yahweh said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you I have seen righteous before me in this generation.

2. Of every clean beast you will take to you seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:

3. of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.

4. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will destroy from off the face of the ground.

5. And Noah did according to all that Yahweh commanded him.

6. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood was on the earth.

7. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

8. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,

9. there went in two and two to Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.

10. And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were on the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

12. And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.

13. In the very same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

14. they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.

15. And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.

16. And those that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Yahweh shut him in.

17. And the flood was forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.

18. And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark went on the face of the waters.

19. And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.

20. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.

21. And all flesh died that moved on the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and all of man:

22. all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.

23. And every living thing was destroyed that was on the face of the ground, from man to cattle, to creeping things, and to birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and those that were with him in the ark.

24. And the waters prevailed on the earth a hundred and fifty days.

## Genesis 8

1. And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided;

2. the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was kept back;

3. and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.

4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.

5. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

6. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:

7. and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

8. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;

9. but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in to him into the ark.

10. And he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;

11. and the dove came in to him at evening; and, look, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

12. And he waited yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return again to him anymore.

13. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and noticed that the face of the ground was dried.

14. And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.

15. And God spoke to Noah, saying,

16. Go forth from the ark, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.

17. Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.

18. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:

19. every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.

20. And Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.

21. And Yahweh smelled the sweet savor; and Yahweh said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again strike anymore everything living, as I have done.

22. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.

## Genesis 9

1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth.

2. And the fear of you{+} and the dread of you{+} will be on every beast of the earth, and on every bird of the heavens; With all by which the ground teems, and all the fish of the sea, into your{+} hand they are delivered.

3. Every moving thing that lives will be food for you{+}, as I have given you{+} everything of the green herb.

4. But flesh with its life, [which is] its blood, you{+} will not eat.

5. And surely your{+} blood, [the blood] of your{+} lives, I will require; At the hand of every beast I will require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man.

6. Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed: For in the image of God he made man.

7. And you{+}, be fruitful and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.

8. And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

9. And I, look, I establish my covenant with you{+}, and with your{+} seed after you{+};

10. and with every living creature that is with you{+}, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you{+}, from all those coming out of the ark to all the beasts of the earth.

11. And I will establish my covenant with you{+}; neither will all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of the flood; neither will there anymore be a flood to destroy the earth.

12. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you{+} and every living creature that is with you{+}, for perpetual generations:

13. I have set my bow in the cloud, and it will be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

14. And it will come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow will be seen in the cloud,

15. and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you{+} and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

16. And the bow will be in the cloud; and I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.

17. And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.

18. And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

19. These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth spread over.

20. And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:

21. and he drank of the wine, and was drunk. And he was uncovered inside his tent.

22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.

23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.

24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.

25. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A slave of slaves he will be to his brothers.

26. And he said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his slave.

27. God enlarge Japheth, And let him stay in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his slave.

28. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

29. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died.

## Genesis 10

1. Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, [namely], of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood.

2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

3. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

4. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.

5. Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

6. And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.

7. And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.

8. And Cush begot Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

9. He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh: therefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Yahweh.

10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad--all of them in the land of Shinar.

11. Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,

12. and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).

13. And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

14. and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from where went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.

15. And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

16. and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,

17. and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

18. and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.

19. And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, to Lasha.

20. These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.

21. And to Shem, the father of all the sons of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were sons born.

22. The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.

23. And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

24. And Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber.

25. And to Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother's name was Joktan.

26. And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

27. and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

28. and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

29. and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.

30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.

31. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

32. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

## Genesis 11

1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.

2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

3. And they said one to another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had slime for mortar.

4. And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may reach] to heaven, and let us make us a name; or else we will be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.

5. And Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of man built.

6. And Yahweh said, Look, they are one people, and they all have one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withheld from them, which they purpose to do.

7. Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

8. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.

9. Therefore the name of it was called Babel; because there Yahweh confounded the language of all the earth: and from there Yahweh scattered them abroad on the face of all the earth.

10. These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood.

11. And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

12. And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begot Shelah.

13. And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

14. And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber:

15. and Shelah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

16. And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg:

17. and Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.

18. And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu:

19. and Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.

20. And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug:

21. and Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.

22. And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor:

23. and Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

24. And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah:

25. and Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.

26. And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27. Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begot Lot.

28. And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

29. And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

30. And Sarai was barren; She had no child.

31. And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and he had them go out from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there.

32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.

## Genesis 12

1. Now Yahweh said to Abram, Get out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to the land that I will show you:

2. and I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and you will be a blessing;

3. and I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse: and in you will all the families of the earth be blessed.

4. So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls who they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

6. And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

7. And Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed I will give this land: and there he built an altar to Yahweh, who appeared to him.

8. And he removed from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he built an altar to Yahweh, and called on the name of Yahweh.

9. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.

10. And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was intense in the land.

11. And it came to pass, when he came near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Now see, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at:

12. and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive.

13. Say, I pray you, you are my sister; that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.

14. And it came to pass, that, when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.

15. And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

16. And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-donkeys, and male slaves, and female slaves, and she-donkeys, and camels.

17. And Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

18. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?

19. Why did you say, She's my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore here is your wife, take her, and go your way.

20. And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.

## Genesis 13

1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.

2. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

3. And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,

4. to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Yahweh.

5. And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

6. And the land wasn't able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

7. And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.

8. And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are brothers.

9. Isn't the whole land before you? Separate yourself, I pray you, from me. If [you will take] the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if [you take] the right hand, then I will go to the left.

10. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.

11. So Lot chose for himself all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

12. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.

13. Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Yahweh exceedingly.

14. And Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward:

15. for all the land which you see, to you I will give it, and to your seed forever.

16. And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may your seed also be numbered.

17. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the width of it; for to you I will give it.

18. And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar to Yahweh.

## Genesis 14

1. And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,

2. that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).

3. All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).

4. Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

5. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,

6. and the Horites in their mountain, Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.

7. And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.

8. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;

9. against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.

10. Now the valley of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the mountain.

11. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.

12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

13. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he stayed by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.

14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he mobilized his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.

15. And he divided himself against them by night, he and his slaves, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.

16. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (the same is the King's Valley).

18. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.

19. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:

20. and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.

21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to yourself.

22. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,

23. that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich:

24. except only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.

## Genesis 15

1. After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, Don't be afraid, Abram: I am your shield, [and] your exceedingly great reward.

2. And Abram said, O Sovereign Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of the inheritance of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?

3. And Abram said, Look, to me you have given no seed: and, see, one born in my house is my heir.

4. And, look, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, This man will not be your heir; But he who will come forth out of inside you will be your heir.

5. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them: and he said to him, So will your seed be.

6. And he believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.

7. And he said to him, I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.

8. And he said, O Sovereign Yahweh, by what shall I know that I will inherit it?

9. And he said to him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

10. And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half opposite the other: but he did not divide the birds.

11. And the birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.

12. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and, look, a dread, dark and enormous, fell on him.

13. And he said to Abram, Know for certain that your seed will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them; and they will afflict them four hundred years;

14. and also that nation, whom they will serve, I will judge: and afterward they will come out with great substance.

15. But you will go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried in a good old age.

16. And in the fourth generation they will come here again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.

17. And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, look, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.

18. In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:

19. the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,

20. and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,

21. and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.

## Genesis 16

1. Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no [children]: and she had a female slave, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

2. And Sarai said to Abram, Now seeing that Yahweh has restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray you, to my slave; it may be that I will obtain [children] by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.

3. And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her slave, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.

4. And he went in to Hagar, and she became pregnant: and when she saw that she had become pregnant, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

5. And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on you: I gave my slave into your bosom; and when she saw that she had become pregnant, I was despised in her eyes: Yahweh judge between me and you.

6. But Abram said to Sarai, Look, your slave is in your hand; do to her that which is good in your eyes. And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.

7. And the angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

8. And he said, Hagar, Sarai's slave, where did you come from? And where are you going? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.

9. And the angel of Yahweh said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.

10. And the angel of Yahweh said to her, I will greatly multiply your seed, it will be too many to count.

11. And the angel of Yahweh said to her, Look, you are pregnant, and will give birth to a son; and you will name him Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction.

12. And he will be [as] a wild donkey among man; his hand [will be] against everyone, and everyone's hand against him; and he will stay across from all his brothers.

13. And she named Yahweh who spoke to her, El-Roi,: for she said, Do I still see now [even] after my vision?

14. Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; look, it is between Kadesh and Bered.

15. And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

16. And Abram was eighty-six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

## Genesis 17

1. And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be perfect.

2. And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.

3. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

4. As for me, look, my covenant is with you, and you will be the father of a multitude of nations.

5. Neither will your name anymore be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations I have made you.

6. And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come out of you.

7. And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you.

8. And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

9. And God said to Abraham, And as for you, you will keep my covenant, you, and your seed after you throughout their generations.

10. This is my covenant, which you{+} will keep, between me and you{+} and your seed after you: every male among you{+} will be circumcised.

11. And you{+} will be circumcised in the flesh of your{+} foreskin; and it will be a token of a covenant between me and you{+}.

12. And he who is eight days old will be circumcised among you{+}, every male throughout your{+} generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner who is not of your seed.

13. He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must surely be circumcised: and my covenant will be in your{+} flesh for an everlasting covenant.

14. And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.

15. And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you will not call her name Sarai, but Sarah will be her name.

16. And I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son of her: yes, I will bless her, and she will be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples will be of her.

17. Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Will a child be born to him who is a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?

18. And Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before you!

19. And God said, No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son; and you will call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.

20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: look, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes he will beget, and I will make him a great nation.

21. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time in the next year.

22. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

23. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had said to him.

24. And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

25. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

26. In the very same day, Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

27. And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

## Genesis 18

1. And Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

2. and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and noticed three men stood across from him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,

3. and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, don't pass away, I pray you, from your slave:

4. let now a little water be fetched, and wash your{+} feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

5. and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen your{+} heart; after that you{+} will pass on: since you{+} have come to your{+} slave. And they said, Do so, as you have said.

6. And Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, Quickly make ready three seahs of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.

7. And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the attendant; and he hurried to dress it.

8. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.

9. And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Look, in the tent.

10. And he said, I will certainly return to you when the season comes around; and, see, Sarah your wife will have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.

11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

12. And Sarah laughed inside herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

13. And Yahweh said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?

14. Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes around, and Sarah will have a son.

15. Then Sarah denied [it], saying, I didn't laugh; for she was afraid. And he said, No; but you did laugh.

16. And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

17. And Yahweh said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;

18. seeing that Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?

19. For I have known him, to the end that he may command his sons and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.

20. And Yahweh said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;

21. I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to its [Sodom's] cry, which has come to me; and if not, I will know.

22. And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.

23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?

24. Perhaps there are fifty righteous inside the city: will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?

25. Far be that from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be that from you: will not the Judge of all the earth do right?

26. And Yahweh said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous inside the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.

27. And Abraham answered and said, Seeing now that I have taken on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:

28. perhaps there will lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.

29. And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Perhaps there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.

30. And he said, Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak: perhaps there will be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

31. And he said, Seeing now that I have taken on myself to speak to the Lord: perhaps there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.

32. And he said, Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: perhaps ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.

33. And Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.

## Genesis 19

1. And the two angels came to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;

2. and he said, Look now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you{+}, into your{+} slave's house, and spend the night, and wash your{+} feet, and you{+} will rise up early, and go on your{+} way. And they said, No; but we will spend the night in the street.

3. And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

4. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;

5. and they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.

6. And Lot went out the door to them, and shut the door after him.

7. And he said, I pray you{+}, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.

8. Look now, I have two daughters that haven't had any sex with a man; let me, I pray you{+}, bring them out to you{+}, and do to them as is good in your{+} eyes: only to these men do nothing, since they have come under the shadow of my roof.

9. And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn and always judges: now we will deal worse with you, than with them. And they pressed intensely on the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.

10. But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.

11. And they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

12. And the men said to Lot, Whomever belongs to you here, a son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:

13. for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Yahweh: and Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.

14. And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Get up, go out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy the city. But he seemed to his sons-in-law as one who mocked.

15. And when the morning arose, the angels then hurried Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, or else you will be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

16. But he lingered; and the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they brought him forth, and set him outside the city.

17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your life; don't look behind you, neither stop in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, or else you will be consumed.

18. And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my lord:

19. now see that your slave has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving-kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life; and I can't escape to the mountain, or else evil will stick to me, and I will die:

20. now see this city that is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there--isn't it a little one?--and my soul will live.

21. And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.

22. Hurry, escape there; for I can't do anything until you have come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

23. The sun was risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.

24. Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven;

25. and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.

26. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27. And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh:

28. and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and over the whole surface of the land (of the [Jordan] valley), and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.

29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.

30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

31. And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:

32. come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

33. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.

34. And it came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Look, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and you go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

35. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.

36. Thus were both the daughters of Lot pregnant by their father.

37. And the firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.

38. And the younger, she also bore a son, and named him Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.

## Genesis 20

1. And Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar.

2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She's my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Look, you are but a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man's wife.

4. Now Abimelech had not had any sex with her. And he said, Lord, will you slay even a righteous nation?

5. Didn't he say to me, She's my sister? And she, even she herself said, He's my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.

6. And God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn't allow you to have any sex with her.

7. Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. And if you don't restore her, know that you will surely die, you, and all who are yours.

8. And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his slaves, and told all these things in their ears. And the men were very afraid.

9. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? And in what have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.

10. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?

11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wife's sake.

12. And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:

13. and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you will show to me. At every place where we will come, say of me, He is my brother.

14. And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male slaves and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him.

15. And Abimelech said, Look, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.

16. And to Sarah he said, See, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Look, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all who are with you. And in respect of all you are righted.

17. And Abraham prayed to God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female slaves. And they gave birth.

18. For Yahweh had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

## Genesis 21

1. And Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.

2. And Sarah became pregnant, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.

4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.

5. And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.

6. And Sarah said, God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.

7. And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should nurse sons? For I have borne him a son in his old age.

8. And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.

9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.

10. Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave and her son. For the son of this slave will not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.

11. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.

12. And God said to Abraham, Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your slave. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For in Isaac will your seed be called.

13. And also of the son of the slave I will make into a nation, because he is your seed.

14. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and [gave her] the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.

15. And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

16. And she went, and she sat down across from him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Don't let me see the child's death. And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.

17. And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.

18. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation.

19. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

20. And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.

21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

22. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.

23. Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me, and to the land in which you have sojourned.

24. And Abraham said, I will swear.

25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's slaves had violently taken away.

26. And Abimelech said, I don't know who has done this thing. You did not tell me, and I had not heard of it yet, but today.

27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. And the two made a covenant.

28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

29. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What do these seven ewe lambs mean which you have set by themselves?

30. And he said, These seven ewe lambs you will take of my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.

31. Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they swore both of them.

32. So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

33. And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there called on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.

34. And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

## Genesis 22

1. And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said to him, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.

2. And he said, Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.

3. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.

4. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.

5. And Abraham said to his young men, You{+} remain here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you{+}.

6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.

7. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, Look, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?

8. And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together.

9. And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.

10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.

11. And the angel of Yahweh called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.

12. And he said, Don't lay your hand on the lad, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you haven't withheld your son, your only son, from me.

13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and noticed a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.

14. And Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh-jireh. As it is said to this day, On the mount of Yahweh it will be provided.

15. And the angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,

16. and said, By myself I have sworn, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and haven't withheld your son, your only son,

17. that in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your seed will possess the gate of his enemies.

18. And in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because you have obeyed my voice.

19. So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.

20. And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Look, Milcah, she also has borne sons to your brother Nahor.

21. Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.

22. And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

24. And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.

## Genesis 23

1. And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years.

2. And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

3. And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,

4. I am a stranger and a sojourner with you{+}. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you{+}, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

5. And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying,

6. Please hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. In the choice of our tombs bury your dead. None of us will withhold from you his tomb that you may bury your dead.

7. And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the sons of Heth.

8. And he communed with them, saying, If it is your{+} mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

9. that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you{+} for a possession of a burying-place.

10. Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the sons of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,

11. Please, my lord, hear me. The field I give you, and the cave that is in it, I give it you. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.

12. And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.

13. And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will, I pray you, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying,

15. Please my lord, listen to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Bury therefore your dead.

16. And Abraham listened to Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant.

17. So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all its border round about, were made sure

18. to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.

19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.

20. And the field, and the cave that is in it, were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the sons of Heth.

## Genesis 24

1. And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age. And Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.

2. And Abraham said to his slave, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh.

3. And I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.

4. But you will go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.

5. And the slave said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I bring your son again to the land from where you came?

6. And Abraham said to him, You be careful not to bring my son there again.

7. Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land. He will send his angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.

8. And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath. Only you will not bring my son there again.

9. And the slave put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.

10. And the slave took ten camels, of the camels of his master, having all good things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.

11. And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.

12. And he said, O Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray you, success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

13. Look, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.

14. And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I will say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink. And she will say, Drink, and I will give your camels to drink also. Let the same be she who you have appointed for your slave Isaac. And by this will I know that you have shown kindness to my master.

15. And it came to pass, before he had finished speaking, that, look, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.

16. And the damsel was very fair to look at, a virgin, neither had any man had any sex with her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

17. And the slave ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher.

18. And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.

19. And when she was done giving him to drink, she said, I will draw for your camels also, until they are done drinking.

20. And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.

21. And the man looked steadfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.

22. And it came to pass, as the camels were done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,

23. and said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I pray you. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?

24. And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.

25. She said moreover to him, We have both straw and fodder enough, and room to lodge in.

26. And the man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.

27. And he said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving-kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.

28. And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.

29. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain.

30. And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me. That he came to the man. And, look, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.

31. And he said, Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

32. And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

33. And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.

34. And he said, I am Abraham's slave.

35. And Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. And he has become great. And he has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male slaves and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.

36. And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old. And to him he has given all that he has.

37. And my master made me swear, saying, You will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.

38. But you will go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.

39. And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.

40. And he said to me, Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. And you will take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.

41. Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred. And if they don't give her to you, you will be free from my oath.

42. And I came this day to the fountain, and said, O Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go.

43. Look, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the young woman that comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink.

44. And she will say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels. Let the same be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master's son.

45. And before I had finished speaking in my heart, look, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the fountain, and drew. And I said to her, Let me drink, I pray you.

46. And she hurried, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels to drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels to drink also.

47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.

48. And I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.

49. And now if you{+} will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can't speak to you bad or good.

51. Look, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as Yahweh has spoken.

52. And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's slave heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.

53. And the slave brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.

54. And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.

55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel remain with us [a few] days, at the least ten. After that she will go.

56. And he said to them, Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.

57. And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.

58. And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.

59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's slave, and his men.

60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be [the mother] of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them.

61. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode on the camels, and followed the man. And the slave took Rebekah, and went his way.

62. And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.

63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and noticed that there were camels coming.

64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.

65. And she said to the slave, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the slave said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.

66. And the slave told Isaac all the things that he had done.

67. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

## Genesis 25

1. And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.

2. And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

3. And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

4. And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.

5. And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.

6. But to the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.

7. And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, 175 years.

8. And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, old and satisfied, and was gathered to his people.

9. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.

10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.

12. Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's slave, bore to Abraham.

13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14. and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15. Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations.

17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered to his people.

18. And they stayed from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He settled across from all his brothers.

19. And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac.

20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.

21. And Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. And Yahweh was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife became pregnant.

22. And the sons struggled together inside her. And she said, If it is so, why is this happening to me? And she went to inquire of Yahweh.

23. And Yahweh said to her, Two nations are in your womb, And two peoples will be separated from inside you. And the one people will be stronger than the other people. And the elder will serve the younger.

24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, look, there were twins in her womb.

25. And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they named him Esau.

26. And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had a hold on Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

27. And the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.

28. Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.

29. And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.

30. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red [pottage]. For I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.

31. And Jacob said, First sell me your birthright.

32. And Esau said, Look, I am about to die. And what profit will the birthright be to me?

33. And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he swore to him. And he sold his birthright to Jacob.

34. And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.

## Genesis 26

1. And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.

2. And Yahweh appeared to him, and said, Don't go down into Egypt. Stay in the land which I will tell you of.

3. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.

4. And I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these lands. And in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,

5. because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

6. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

7. And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She's my sister. For he feared to say, My wife, because the men of the place would kill me for Rebekah since she was fair to look at.

8. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, look, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

9. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Look, certainly she's your wife. And how have you said, She's my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said if I didn't I would die because of her.

10. And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.

11. And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.

12. And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Yahweh blessed him.

13. And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.

14. And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.

15. Now all the wells which his father's slaves had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.

16. And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us. For you are much mightier than we.

17. And Isaac departed there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

18. And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.

19. And Isaac's slaves dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.

20. And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.

21. And they dug another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.

22. And he removed from there, and dug another well. And for that they didn't strive. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.

23. And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.

24. And Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my slave Abraham's sake.

25. And he built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's slaves dug a well.

26. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.

27. And Isaac said to them, Why have you{+} come to me, seeing you{+} hate me, and have sent me away from you{+}?

28. And they said, We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. And we said, Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,

29. that you will do us no hurt, as we haven't touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of Yahweh.

30. And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.

31. And they rose up early in the morning, and swore one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

32. And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's slaves came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.

33. And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.

34. And when Esau was forty years old he took as wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

35. And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebekah.

## Genesis 27

1. And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, My son. And he said to him, Here I am.

2. And he said, Look now, I am old, I don't know the day of my death.

3. Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt venison for me.

4. And make savory food for me, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless you before I die.

5. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

6. And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Look, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,

7. Bring venison to me, and make savory food for me, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.

8. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.

9. Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good young goats. And I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves.

10. And you will bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.

11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Look, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.

12. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will seem to him as a deceiver. And I will bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.

13. And his mother said to him, Your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

14. And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.

15. And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.

16. And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.

17. And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

18. And he came to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are you, my son?

19. And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done according to as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.

20. And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Yahweh your God sent me success.

21. And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are my very son Esau or not.

22. And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

23. And he did not discern him, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.

24. And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

25. And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he ate. And he brought him wine, and he drank.

26. And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.

27. And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.

28. And God give you of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and new wine.

29. Let peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, And let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, And blessed be everyone who blesses you.

30. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

31. And he also made savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me.

32. And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.

33. And Isaac trembled very greatly, and said, Who then is he that has hunted venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, [and] he will be blessed.

34. When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a very great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.

35. And he said, Your brother came with guile, and has taken away your blessing.

36. And he said, Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. And, look, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?

37. And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Look, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for slaves. And with grain and new wine I have sustained him. And what then shall I do for you, my son?

38. And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

39. And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Look, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above.

40. And by your sword you will live, and you will serve your brother. And it will come to pass, when you will break loose, That you will shake his yoke from off your neck.

41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will slay my brother Jacob.

42. And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Look, your brother Esau, as concerning you, comforts himself, [purposing] to kill you.

43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee to Laban my brother, to Haran.

44. And tarry with him a few days, until your brother's fury turn away.

45. Until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets that which you have done to him. Then I will send, and fetch you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you{+} both in one day?

46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?

## Genesis 28

1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, You will not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

2. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. And take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.

3. And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples.

4. And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you. That you may inherit the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.

5. And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

6. Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from there. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You will not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

7. And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and had gone to Paddan-aram.

8. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac his father.

9. And Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.

10. And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.

11. And he came upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.

12. And he dreamed. And look, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And look, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

13. And, look, Yahweh stood above it, and said, I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, to you I will give it, and to your seed.

14. And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.

15. And, look, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.

16. And Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Yahweh is in this place. And I didn't know it.

17. And he was afraid, and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.

19. And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at first.

20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,

21. so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,

22. then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God's house. And of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you.

## Genesis 29

1. Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east.

2. And he looked, and noticed a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone on the well's mouth was great.

3. And there were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place.

4. And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where are you{+} from? And they said, We are of Haran.

5. And he said to them, Do you{+} know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.

6. And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, look, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.

7. And he said, Look, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.

8. And they said, We can't, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.

9. While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. For she shepherded them.

10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

12. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.

13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

14. And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he remained with him the space of a month.

15. And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?

16. And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

17. And Leah's eyes were tender. But Rachel had a beautiful body and face.

18. And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.

19. And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than I should give her to another man. Remain with me.

20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they were like a few days in his eyes, for the love he had to her.

21. And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.

22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in to her.

24. And Laban gave Zilpah his female slave to his daughter Leah for a slave.

25. And it came to pass in the morning that, look, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you beguiled me?

26. And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.

27. Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet another seven years.

28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.

29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his female slave to be her slave.

30. And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet another seven years.

31. And Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren.

32. And Leah became pregnant, and gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, Because Yahweh has looked on my affliction. For now my husband will love me.

33. And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a son: and said, Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this [son] also. And she named him Simeon.

34. And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore he named him Levi.

35. And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a son. And she said, This time I will praise Yahweh. Therefore she named him Judah. And she left off bearing.

## Genesis 30

1. And when Rachel saw that she did not bear for Jacob, Rachel envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, Give me sons, otherwise I will die.

2. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?

3. And she said, Look, my slave Bilhah, go in to her; that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain [children] by her.

4. And she gave him Bilhah her slave as wife: and Jacob went in to her.

5. And Bilhah became pregnant, and bore Jacob a son.

6. And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan.

7. And Bilhah Rachel's slave became pregnant again, and bore Jacob a second son.

8. And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she named him Naphtali.

9. When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her slave, and gave her to Jacob as wife.

10. And Zilpah Leah's slave bore Jacob a son.

11. And Leah said, Fortunate! And she named him Gad.

12. And Zilpah Leah's slave bore Jacob a second son.

13. And Leah said, I am happy! For the daughters will call me happy: and she named him Asher.

14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes.

15. And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? And would you take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.

16. And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

17. And God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant, and bore Jacob a fifth son.

18. And Leah said, God has given me my wages, because I gave my slave to my husband: and she named him Issachar.

19. And Leah became pregnant again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.

20. And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she named him Zebulun.

21. And afterward she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.

22. And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.

23. And she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son: and said, God has taken away my reproach:

24. and she named him Joseph, saying, Yahweh add to me another son.

25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.

26. Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service with which I have served you.

27. And Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in your eyes, [tarry]: [for] I have used magic and [found that] Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.

28. And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.

29. And he said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.

30. For you had little before I came, and it has increased to a multitude; and Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?

31. And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You will not give me anything: if you will do this thing for me, I will again shepherd your flock and keep it.

32. I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] will be my wages.

33. So will my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when you will come concerning my wages that are before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that [if found] with me, will be counted stolen.

34. And Laban said, Agreed, let it be according to your word.

35. And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;

36. and he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob shepherded the rest of Laban's flocks.

37. And Jacob took for himself rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.

38. And he set the rods which he had peeled across from the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.

39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.

40. And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them to Laban's flock.

41. And it came to pass, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;

42. but when the flock was feeble, he didn't put them in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

43. And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and female slaves and male slaves, and camels and donkeys.

## Genesis 31

1. And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's he has gotten all this glory.

2. And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and, look, it was not toward him as formerly.

3. And Yahweh said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.

4. And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,

5. and said to them, I see your{+} father's countenance, that it is not toward me as formerly; but the God of my father has been with me.

6. And you{+} know that with all my power I have served your{+} father.

7. And your{+} father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God didn't allow him to hurt me.

8. If he said thus, The speckled will be your wages; then all the flock bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked will be your wages; then bore all the flock ringstreaked.

9. Thus God has taken away the cattle of your{+} father, and given them to me.

10. And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, look, the he-goats which leaped on the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.

11. And the angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here I am.

12. And he said, Lift up now your eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap on the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban does to you.

13. I am the God of Beth-el, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your nativity.

14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

15. Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.

16. For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our son's: now then, whatever God has said to you, do.

17. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels;

18. and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father to the land of Canaan.

19. Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the talismans that were her father's.

20. And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he fled.

21. So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.

22. And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.

23. And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he stuck [closely] in the mountain of Gilead.

24. And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, You be careful not to speak to Jacob either good or bad.

25. And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brothers encamped in the mountain of Gilead.

26. And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?

27. Why did you flee secretly, and steal away from me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;

28. and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.

29. It is in the power of my hand to do you{+} harm: but the God of your{+} father spoke to me last night, saying, You be careful that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.

30. And now, [though] you would surely be gone, because you intensely longed after your father's house, [yet] why have you stolen my gods?

31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said if I don't, you will take your daughters from me by force.

32. With whomever you find your gods, he will not live: before our brothers discern for yourself what is yours with me, and take it with you. For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.

33. And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female slaves; but he didn't find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

34. Now Rachel had taken the talismans, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. And Laban felt all about the tent, but didn't find them.

35. And she said to her father, Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me. And he searched, but didn't find the talismans.

36. And Jacob was angry, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?

37. Whereas you have felt all about my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us two.

38. These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats haven't cast their young, and the rams of your flocks I have not eaten.

39. That which was torn of beasts I didn't bring to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.

40. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.

41. These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock: and you have changed my wages ten times.

42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.

43. And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons whom they have borne?

44. And now come, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.

45. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

46. And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there by the heap.

47. And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.

48. And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:

49. and Mizpah, for he said, Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.

50. If you will afflict my daughters, and if you will take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.

51. And Laban said to Jacob, Look at this heap, and look at the pillar, which I have set between me and you.

52. This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.

53. May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.

54. And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.

55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned to his place.

## Genesis 32

1. And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

2. And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.

4. And he commanded them, saying, Thus you{+} will say to my lord Esau: Thus says your slave Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and remained until now:

5. and I have oxen, and donkeys, [and] flocks, and male slaves, and female slaves: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.

6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and moreover he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.

7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;

8. and he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.

9. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh, who said to me, Return to your country, and to your kindred, and I will do you good:

10. I am not worthy of the least of all the loving-kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your slave; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.

11. Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him. Or else, he will come and strike me, from mother to sons.

12. And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which will be too many to count.

13. And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:

14. two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

15. thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.

16. And he delivered them into the hand of his slaves, every drove by itself, and said to his slaves, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.

17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? And where do you go? And whose are these before you?

18. Then you will say [They are] your slave Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, look, he also is behind us.

19. And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this manner you{+} will speak to Esau, when you{+} find him;

20. and you{+} will say, Moreover, look, your slave Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.

21. So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.

22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two female slaves, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.

23. And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.

24. And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

25. And when he saw that he didn't prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.

26. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.

27. And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.

28. And he said, Your name will not be Jacob anymore, but Israel: for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.

29. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you ask for my name? And he blessed him there.

30. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [he said], I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

31. And the sun rose on him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped on his thigh.

32. Therefore the sons of Israel don't eat the sinew of the hip which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.

## Genesis 33

1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and noticed that Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two female slaves.

2. And he put the female slaves and their children first, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.

3. And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

5. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your slave.

6. Then the female slaves came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.

7. And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and afterward came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

8. And he said, What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.

9. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.

10. And Jacob said, No, I pray you, if now I have found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand; since I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.

11. Take, I pray you, my gift that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

12. And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.

13. And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.

14. Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his slave: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord, to Seir.

15. And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me. And he said, Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.

16. So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

17. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

18. And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.

19. And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.

20. And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.

## Genesis 34

1. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.

2. And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.

3. And his soul stuck to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.

4. And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel as wife.

5. Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.

6. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.

7. And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.

8. And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your{+} daughter: I pray you{+}, give her to him as wife.

9. And make{+} marriages with us; give your{+} daughters to us, and take our daughters to you{+}.

10. And you{+} will dwell with us: and the land will be before you{+}; dwell and trade in it, and get possessions in it.

11. And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your{+} eyes, and what you{+} will say to me, I will give.

12. Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to as you{+} will say to me: but give me the damsel as wife.

13. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,

14. and said to them, We can't do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that would be a reproach to us.

15. Only on this condition we will consent to you{+}: if you{+} will be as we are, that every male of you{+} is circumcised;

16. then we will give our daughters to you{+}, and we will take your{+} daughters to us, and we will dwell with you{+}, and we will become one people.

17. But if you{+} will not listen to us, to be circumcised; then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.

18. And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

19. And the young man didn't defer to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.

20. And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

21. These men are peaceful with us; so let them dwell in the land, and trade in it; for, look, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.

22. Only on this condition will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.

23. Will not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.

24. And to Hamor and to Shechem his son listened all who went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

25. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.

26. And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth.

27. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.

28. They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;

29. and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, they captured and plundered, as well as all that was in the houses.

30. And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You{+} have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and strike me; and I will be destroyed, I and my house.

31. And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?

## Genesis 35

1. And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.

2. Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you{+}, and purify yourselves, and change your{+} garments:

3. and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

4. And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

5. And they journeyed: and a terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

6. So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people who were with him.

7. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

8. And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.

9. And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.

10. And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel will be your name: and he named him Israel.

11. And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations will be of you, and kings will come out of your loins;

12. and the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you I will give the land.

13. And God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.

14. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering on it, and poured oil on it.

15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.

16. And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.

17. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Don't be afraid; for now you will have another son.

18. And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.

19. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).

20. And Jacob set up a pillar on her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.

21. And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.

22. And it came to pass, while Israel stayed in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it, and it was evil in his eyes. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

23. The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;

24. the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;

25. and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's slave: Dan and Naphtali;

26. and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's slave: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.

27. And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

28. And the days of Isaac were 180 years.

29. And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

## Genesis 36

1. Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).

2. Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,

3. and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.

4. And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel;

5. and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.

6. And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.

7. For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.

8. And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

9. And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

10. these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.

11. And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

12. And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.

13. And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.

14. And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.

15. These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,

16. chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.

17. And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.

18. And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

19. These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom.

20. These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,

21. and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.

22. And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotan's sister was Timna.

23. And these are the sons of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.

24. And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father.

25. And these are the sons of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.

26. And these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.

27. These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.

28. These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.

29. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,

30. chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.

31. And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the sons of Israel.

32. And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

33. And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.

34. And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.

35. And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.

36. And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

37. And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.

38. And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

39. And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.

40. And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,

41. chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,

42. chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,

43. chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.

## Genesis 37

1. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.

2. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them to their father.

3. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.

4. And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.

5. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers: and they hated him all the more.

6. And he said to them, Hear, I pray you{+}, this dream which I have dreamed:

7. for, look, we were binding sheaves in the field, and see, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and see, your{+} sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

8. And his brothers said to him, Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

9. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, Look, I have dreamed yet a dream: and see, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.

10. And he told it to his father, and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?

11. And his brothers envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.

12. And his brothers went to shepherd their father's flock in Shechem.

13. And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers shepherding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.

14. And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15. And a certain man found him, and, look, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What do you seek?

16. And he said, I am seeking my brothers: tell me, I pray you, where they are shepherding [the flock].

17. And the man said, They have departed from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.

18. And they saw him far off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.

19. And they said one to another, Look, this dreamer comes.

20. Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast has devoured him: and we will see what will become of his dreams.

21. And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.

22. And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.

23. And it came to pass, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;

24. and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.

25. And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and noticed a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.

26. And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?

27. Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and don't let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers listened to him.

28. And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.

29. And Reuben returned to the pit; and, look, Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

30. And he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?

31. And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;

32. and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This we have found: know now whether it is your son's coat or not.

33. And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat: an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.

34. And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

35. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.

36. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.

## Genesis 38

1. And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in to her.

3. And she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son; and he named him Er.

4. And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a son; and she named him Onan.

5. And she yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.

6. And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.

7. And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. And Yahweh slew him.

8. And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother.

9. And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, whenever he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.

10. And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and he slew him also.

11. Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah my son is grown up; for he said, Or else he will also die, like his brothers. And Tamar went and remained in her father's house.

12. And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his companion Hirah the Adullamite.

13. And it was told Tamar, saying, Look, your father-in-law goes up to Timnah to shear his sheep.

14. And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as wife.

15. When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; for she had covered her face.

16. And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray you, let me come in to you: for he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?

17. And he said, I will send you a young goat from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a security deposit, until you send it?

18. And he said, What security deposit shall I give you? And she said, Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and had sex with her, and she became pregnant by him.

19. And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

20. And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his companion the Adullamite, to receive the security deposit from the woman's hand: but he didn't find her.

21. Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.

22. And he returned to Judah, and said, I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.

23. And Judah said, Let her take it to her, or else we will be put to shame: look, I sent this young goat, and you haven't found her.

24. And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has prostituted; and moreover, look, she's pregnant by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

25. When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, I am pregnant: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.

26. And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She's more righteous than I; since I didn't give her to Shelah my son. And he didn't have any sex with her again.

27. And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, look, twins were in her womb.

28. And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

29. And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, look, his brother came out: and she said, Why have you made a breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez.

30. And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread on his hand: and his name was called Zerah.

## Genesis 39

1. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down there.

2. And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

3. And his master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

4. And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he ministered to him: and he made him Overseer of the House, and all that he had he put into his hand.

5. And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.

6. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he didn't know anything [that was] with him, except the bread which he ate. And Joseph had a handsome body and face.

7. And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

8. But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Look, my master doesn't know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand:

9. he is not greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

10. And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he didn't listen to her to lie by her, to have any sex with her.

11. And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there wasn't any man of the men of the house there inside.

12. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got out.

13. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,

14. that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us: he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

15. and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got out.

16. And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.

17. And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew slave, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me:

18. and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.

19. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did your slave to me; that his wrath was kindled.

20. And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.

21. But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

22. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever they did there, he was the one who did it.

23. The keeper of the prison didn't look to anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it to prosper.

## Genesis 40

1. And it came to pass after these things, that the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was angry against his two officers, against the chief of the cupbearers, and against the chief of the bakers.

3. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

4. And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered to them: and they continued a season in ward.

5. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.

6. And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and, look, they were sad.

7. And he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Why do you{+} look so sad today?

8. And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none who can interpret it. And Joseph said to them, Don't interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, I pray you{+}.

9. And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, look, a vine was before me;

10. and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, [and] its blossoms shot forth; [and] its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:

11. and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

12. And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;

13. within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you to your office: and you will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his cupbearer.

14. But have me in your remembrance when it will be well with you, and show kindness, I pray you, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

15. for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

16. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, look, three baskets of white bread were on my head:

17. and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.

18. And Joseph answered and said, This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;

19. within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.

20. And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his slaves: and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his slaves.

21. And he restored the chief cupbearer to be his cupbearer again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

22. but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

23. Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot him.

## Genesis 41

1. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, look, he stood by the river.

2. And, look, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they pastured in the reed-grass.

3. And, look, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine on the brink of the river.

4. And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine ate up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

5. And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, look, seven ears of grain came up on one stalk, rank and good.

6. And, look, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.

7. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, look, it was a dream.

8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the sacred scholars of Egypt, and all its wise men: and Pharaoh told them the things he dreamt; but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.

9. Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I remember my faults this day:

10. Pharaoh was angry with his slaves, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:

11. and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

12. And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, slave to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

13. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.

14. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.

15. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none who can interpret it: and I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.

16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

17. And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, look, I stood on the brink of the river:

18. and see, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:

19. and see, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:

20. and the lean and ill-favored kine ate up the first seven fat kine:

21. and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

22. And I saw in my dream, and see, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:

23. and see, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:

24. and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it to the sacred scholars; but there was none who could declare it to me.

25. And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.

26. The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.

27. And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven thin ears blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.

28. That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh: what God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.

29. Look, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:

30. and there will arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will consume the land;

31. and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.

32. And the reason the dream was doubled to Pharaoh is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

33. Now therefore let Pharaoh seek out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

34. Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

35. And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.

36. And the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.

37. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his slaves.

38. And Pharaoh said to his slaves, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God?

39. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has shown you all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as you:

40. you will be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled: I will be greater than you only in the throne.

41. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;

43. and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.

44. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you will no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him as wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

46. And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

47. And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.

48. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

49. And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.

50. And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.

51. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For, [he said], God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

52. And the name of the second he called Ephraim: For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.

53. And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.

54. And the seven years of famine began to come, according to as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

55. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he says to you{+}, do.

56. And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all [the storehouses] among them, and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine was intense in the land of Egypt.

57. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was intense in all the earth.

## Genesis 42

1. Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, Why do you{+} look one on another?

2. And he said, Look, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: you{+} get down there, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die.

3. And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

4. But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob didn't send with his brothers; for he said, If I do perhaps harm will befall him.

5. And the sons of Israel came to buy among those who came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

6. And Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.

7. And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said to them. From where do you{+} come? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

8. And Joseph knew his brothers, but they didn't know him.

9. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You{+} are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you{+} have come.

10. And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have your slaves come.

11. We are all sons of one man; we are true men, your slaves are no spies.

12. And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you{+} have come.

13. And they said, We your slaves are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, look, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.

14. And Joseph said to them, That is it that I spoke to you{+}, saying, You{+} are spies:

15. hereby you{+} will be proved: by the life of Pharaoh you{+} will not go forth from here, except your{+} youngest brother come here.

16. Send one of you{+}, and let him fetch your{+} brother, and you{+} will be bound, that your{+} words may be proved, whether there is truth in you{+}: otherwise by the life of Pharaoh surely you{+} are spies.

17. And he put them all together into ward three days.

18. And Joseph said to them the third day, Do this, and live: for I fear God:

19. if you{+} are true men, let one of your{+} brothers be bound in your{+} prison-house; but you{+} go, carry grain for the famine of your{+} houses:

20. and bring your{+} youngest brother to me; so will your{+} words be verified, and you{+} will not die. And they did so.

21. And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he pled with us for mercy, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Didn't I speak to you{+}, saying, Don't sin against the child; and you{+} would not hear? Therefore also, look, his blood is required.

23. And they didn't know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.

24. And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.

25. Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done to them.

26. And they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed there.

27. And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder in the lodging-place, he noticed his money; and, look, it was in the mouth of his sack.

28. And he said to his brothers, My money is restored; and, look, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?

29. And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,

30. The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.

31. And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:

32. we are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

33. And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby will I know that you{+} are true men: leave one of your{+} brothers with me, and take [grain for] the famine of your{+} houses, and go your{+} way;

34. and bring your{+} youngest brother to me: then I will know that you{+} are no spies, but that you{+} are true men: so I will deliver you{+} your{+} brother, and you{+} will traffic in the land.

35. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, look, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.

36. And Jacob their father said to them, You{+} have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you{+} will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

37. And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I don't bring him to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.

38. And he said, My son will not go down with you{+}; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which you{+} go, then you{+} will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.

## Genesis 43

1. And the famine was intense in the land.

2. And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.

3. And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, You{+} will not see my face, except your{+} brother be with you{+}.

4. If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food:

5. but if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You{+} will not see my face, except your{+} brother be with you{+}.

6. And Israel said, Why did you{+} deal so ill with me, as to tell the man whether you{+} had yet a brother?

7. And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your{+} father yet alive? Have you{+} [another] brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your{+} brother down?

8. And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.

9. I will be surety for him; of my hand you will require him: if I don't bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever:

10. for except we had lingered, surely we would have now returned a second time.

11. And their father Israel said to them, If it is so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your{+} vessels, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;

12. and take double money in your{+} hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your{+} sacks carry again in your{+} hand; perhaps it was an oversight:

13. take also your{+} brother, and arise, go again to the man:

14. and God Almighty give you{+} mercy before the man, that he may release to you{+} your{+} other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.

15. And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men will dine with me at noon.

17. And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.

18. And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we are brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall on us, and take us for slaves, and our donkeys.

19. And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,

20. and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

21. and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, look, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

22. And other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food: we don't know who put our money in our sacks.

23. And he said, Peace be to you{+}, don't be afraid: your{+} God, and the God of your{+} father, has given you{+} treasure in your{+} sacks: I had your{+} money. And he brought Simeon out to them.

24. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their donkeys fodder.

25. And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.

26. And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.

27. And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your{+} father well, the old man of whom you{+} spoke? Is he yet alive?

28. And they said, Your slave our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.

29. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your{+} youngest brother, of whom you{+} spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.

30. And Joseph hurried; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.

31. And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.

32. And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is disgusting to the Egyptians.

33. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one with another.

34. And he took [and sent] messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

## Genesis 44

1. And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.

2. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

3. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.

4. [And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Get up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you{+} rewarded evil for good?

5. Isn't this that in which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed uses it for magic? You{+} have done evil in so doing.

6. And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.

7. And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your slaves that they should do such a thing.

8. Look, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?

9. With whomever of your slaves it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.

10. And he said, Now also let it be according to your{+} words: he with whom it is found will be my slave; and you{+} will be innocent.

11. Then they hurried, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.

12. And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

13. Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his donkey, and returned to the city.

14. And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

15. And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you{+} have done? Don't you{+} know that a man such as I can indeed use magic [to find out]?

16. And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your slaves: look, we are my lord's slaves, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.

17. And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave but as for you{+}, you{+} get up in peace to your{+} father.

18. Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, let your slave, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your slave; for you are even as Pharaoh.

19. My lord asked his slaves, saying, Have you{+} a father, or a brother?

20. And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.

21. And you said to your slaves, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.

22. And we said to my lord, The lad can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.

23. And you said to your slaves, Except your{+} youngest brother come down with you{+}, you{+} will see my face no more.

24. And it came to pass when we came up to your slave my father, we told him the words of my lord.

25. And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.

26. And we said, We can't go down: if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother is with us.

27. And your slave my father said to us, You{+} know that my wife bore me two sons:

28. and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I haven't seen him since:

29. and if you{+} take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you{+} will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.

30. Now therefore when I come to your slave my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

31. it will come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not there, that he will die: and your slaves will bring down the gray hairs of your slave our father with sorrow to Sheol.

32. For your slave became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.

33. Now therefore, let your slave, I pray you, remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.

34. For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad is not with me? Or else, I will see the evil that will come upon my father.

## Genesis 45

1. Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

2. And he wept aloud: and Egypt heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.

3. And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.

4. And Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you{+}. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your{+} brother, whom you{+} sold into Egypt.

5. And now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you{+} sold me here: for God sent me before you{+} to preserve life.

6. For these two years has the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.

7. And God sent me before you{+} to preserve you{+} a remnant in the earth, and to save you{+} alive by a great deliverance.

8. So now it wasn't you{+} who sent me here, but God: and he has made me Father of Pharaoh, and Lord of All His House, and Ruler Over All The Land of Egypt.

9. You{+} hurry, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down to me, don't tarry;

10. and you will dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, and your sons, and the sons of your sons, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:

11. and there I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; or else you will come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.

12. And, look, your{+} eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you{+}.

13. And you{+} will tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you{+} have seen: and you{+} will hurry and bring down my father here.

14. And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.

15. And he kissed all his brothers, and wept on them: and after that his brothers talked with him.

16. And its report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his slaves.

17. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, You{+} do this: lade your{+} beasts, and go, you{+} get to the land of Canaan;

18. and take your{+} father and your{+} households, and come to me: and I will give you{+} the good of the land of Egypt, and you{+} will eat the fat of the land.

19. Now you are commanded, this you{+} do: you{+} take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your{+} little ones, and for your{+} wives, and bring your{+} father, and come.

20. Also don't regard your{+} stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours{+}.

21. And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

22. To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

23. And to his father he sent after this manner: ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-donkeys laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.

24. So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you{+} don't fall out by the way.

25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.

26. And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he didn't believe them.

27. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

28. and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

## Genesis 46

1. And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.

2. And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here I am.

3. And he said, I am God, the God of your father: don't be afraid to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation:

4. I will go down with you into Egypt; and I will also surely bring you up again: and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes.

5. And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

6. And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:

7. his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.

8. And these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt. Jacob and his sons. Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

9. And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

10. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

11. And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

12. And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.

13. And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Jashub, and Shimron.

14. And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

15. These are the sons of Leah whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, as well as his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.

16. And the sons of Gad: Zephon, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

17. And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.

18. These are the sons of Zilpah whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen souls.

19. The sons of Jacob's wife, Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.

20. And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bore to him. And the sons of Manasseh: his wife bore Asriel, and his Aramean concubine bore Machir. And Machir begot Gilead. And the sons of Manasseh's brother, Ephraim: Shuthelah and Tahan. And the sons of Shuthelah: Eran.

21. And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel; and the sons of Bela were: Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, and Muppim; and Gera begot Ard.

22. These are the sons of Rachel she bore to Jacob: nineteen souls in all.

23. And the sons of Dan: Hushim.

24. And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

25. These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: seven souls in all.

26. All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, excluding Jacob's daughters-in-law, were sixty-six souls in all.

27. And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, were nine souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came with Jacob into Egypt, were seventy-five souls.

28. Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to show Joseph the way to [them in] Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

29. And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

30. And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are yet alive.

31. And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me;

32. and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

33. And it will come to pass, when Pharaoh will call you{+}, and will say, What is your{+} occupation?

34. Then you{+} will say, Your slaves have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that you{+} may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is disgusting to the Egyptians.

## Genesis 47

1. Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and, look, they are in the land of Goshen.

2. And from among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.

3. And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your{+} occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your slaves are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.

4. And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land we have come; for there is no pasture for your slaves' flocks; for the famine is intense in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your slaves dwell in the land of Goshen.

5. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know that there are among them capable men, put them in charge of my herds. And Jacob and his sons came to Egypt to Joseph, and Pharaoh the king of Egypt heard it. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Your father and your brothers have come to you.

6. Look, the land of Egypt is before you. You may settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land.

7. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8. And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?

9. And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they haven't attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.

11. And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

12. And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.

13. And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very intense, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

15. And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? For [our] money fails.

16. And Joseph said, Give your{+} cattle; and I will give it to you{+} for your{+} cattle, if you{+} are out of money.

17. And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.

18. And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

19. why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land not be desolate.

20. So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was intense on them: and the land became Pharaoh's.

21. And as for the people, he made them slaves from one end of the border of Egypt even to its other end.

22. Only the land of the priests he didn't buy: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they didn't sell their land.

23. Then Joseph said to the people, Look, I have bought you{+} this day and your{+} land for Pharaoh: look, here is seed for you{+}, and you{+} will sow the land.

24. And it will come to pass at the ingatherings, that you{+} will give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your{+} own, for seed of the field, and for your{+} food, and for them of your{+} households, and for food for your{+} little ones.

25. And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves.

26. And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.

27. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got possessions in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.

29. And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: don't bury me, I pray you, in Egypt;

30. but when I sleep with my fathers, you will carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as you have said.

31. And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed.

## Genesis 48

1. And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Look, your father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

2. And one told Jacob, and said, Look, your son Joseph comes to you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.

3. And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

4. and said to me, Look, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.

5. And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.

6. And your issue, that you beget after them, will be yours; they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.

7. And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).

8. And Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

9. And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.

10. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.

11. And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, look, God has let me see your seed also.

12. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.

14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

15. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,

16. the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

17. And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.

18. And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.

19. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great: nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.

20. And he blessed them that day, saying, In you [Joseph] will Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

21. And Israel said to Joseph, Look, I die: but God will be with you{+}, and bring you{+} again to the land of your{+} fathers.

22. Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

## Genesis 49

1. And Jacob called to his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you{+} that which will befall you{+} in the latter days.

2. Assemble yourselves, and hear, you{+} sons of Jacob; And listen to Israel your{+} father.

3. Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The preeminence of dignity, and the preeminence of power.

4. Boiling over as water, you will not have the preeminence; Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled it: he went up to my couch.

5. Simeon and Levi are brothers; They determined to destroy violently.

6. O my soul, don't come into their council; To their assembly, my glory, don't be united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox.

7. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.

8. Judah, you will your brothers praise: Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons will bow down before you.

9. Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who will rouse him up?

10. The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes: And to him will the obedience of the peoples be.

11. Binding his foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He has washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:

12. His eyes will be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.

13. Zebulun will stay at the haven of the sea; And he will be for a haven of ships; And his border will be on Sidon.

14. Issachar is a strong donkey, Couching down between the sheepfolds:

15. And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became slave labor.

16. Dan will judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.

17. Dan will be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.

18. I have waited for your salvation, O Yahweh.

19. Gad, a troop will press on him; But he will press on their heel.

20. Out of Asher his bread will be fat, And he will yield royal dainties.

21. Naphtali is a hind let loose: He gives goodly words.

22. Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall.

23. The archers have intensely grieved him because they shot at him, and persecuted him:

24. But his bow remained firm, and the arms of his hands were agile, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, Israel's shepherd and rock,

25. Even by the God of your father, who will help you, And by the Almighty, who will bless you, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.

26. The blessings of your father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors To the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They will be on the head of Joseph, And on the top of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.

27. Benjamin is a wolf that ravens: In the morning he will devour the prey, And at evening he will divide the spoil.

28. All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spoke to them and blessed them; each one, according to the blessing suitable to him, he blessed them.

29. And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my relatives: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

30. in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.

31. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:

32. the field and the cave that is in it, which was purchased from the sons of Heth.

33. And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 50

1. And Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him.

2. And Joseph commanded his slaves the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

3. And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him 70 days.

4. And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your{+} eyes, speak, I pray you{+}, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

5. My father made me swear, saying, Look, I die: in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there you will bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.

6. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according to as he made you swear.

7. And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the slaves of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

8. and all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

9. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.

10. And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and intense lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

11. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: therefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.

12. And his sons did to him according to as he commanded them:

13. for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

14. And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

15. And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did to him.

16. And they told Joseph the following order, Your father commanded before he died, saying,

17. So you{+} will say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the transgression of your brothers, and their sin, because they did to you evil. And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the slaves of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

18. And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Look, we are your slaves.

19. And Joseph said to them, Don't be afraid: for am I in the place of God?

20. And as for you{+}, you{+} meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.

21. Now therefore don't be{+} afraid: I will nourish you{+}, and your{+} little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.

22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.

23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third generation: the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees.

24. And Joseph said to his brothers, I die; but God will surely visit you{+}, and bring you{+} up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

25. And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you{+}, and you{+} will carry up my bones from here.

26. So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
