# Obadiah

## Obadiah 1

1. The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh concerning Edom: We have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Arise{+}, and let us rise up against her in battle.

2. Look, I have made you small among the nations: you are greatly despised.

3. The pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who stay in the clefts of the rock, in the height of your habitation; who says in his heart, Who will bring me down to the ground?

4. Though you mount on high as the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.

5. If thieves came to you, if robbers by night (how you are cut off!), would they not steal [only] until they had enough? If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?

6. How are [the things of] Esau searched! How are his hidden treasures sought out!

7. All the men of your confederacy have brought you on your way, even to the border: the men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you; [those who eat] your bread lay a snare under you: there is no understanding in him.

8. Shall I not in that day, says Yahweh, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

9. And your mighty men, O Teman, will be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.

10. For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever.

11. In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.

12. But don't look on the day of your brother in the day of his disaster, and don't rejoice over the sons of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.

13. Don't enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, don't look on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither lay{+} [hands] on their substance in the day of their calamity.

14. And don't stand in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and don't deliver up those of his that remain in the day of distress.

15. For the day of Yahweh is near on all the nations: as you have done, it will be done to you; your dealing will return on your own head.

16. For as you{+} have drank on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually; yes, they will drink, and swallow down, and will be as though they had not been.

17. But in mount Zion there will be those who escape, and it will be holy; and the house of Jacob will possess those who dispossess them.

18. And the house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they will burn among them, and devour them; and there will not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for Yahweh has spoken it.

19. And those of the South will possess the mount of Esau, and those of the lowland the Philistines; and they will possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria; and Benjamin [will possess] Gilead.

20. And the captives of this bulwark of the sons of Israel, who are [among] the Canaanites, [will possess] even to Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the South.

21. And saviors will come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom will be Yahweh's.
