## Psalms 1

1. Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.

2. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.

3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he does shall prosper.

4. The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.

5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6. For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,

3. Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

4. He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.

5. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

6. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

7. I will declare the decree: the LORD has said unto me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.

8. Ask of me, and I shall give you the heathen for yours inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.

9. You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

10. Be wise now therefore, O all of you kings: be instructed, all of you judges of the earth.

11. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and all of you perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

## Psalms 3

1. Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.

2. Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.

3. But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.

4. I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.

5. I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

6. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.

7. Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for you have smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; you have broken the teeth of the ungodly.

8. Salvation belongs unto the LORD: your blessing is upon your people. Selah.

## Psalms 4

1. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: you have enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

2. O all of you sons of men, how long will all of you turn my glory into shame? how long will all of you love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

3. But know that the LORD has set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

4. Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.

6. There be many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift you up the light of your countenance upon us.

7. You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.

8. I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for you, LORD, only make me dwell in safety.

## Psalms 5

1. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

2. Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto you will I pray.

3. My voice shall you hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto you, and will look up.

4. For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you.

5. The foolish shall not stand in your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity.

6. You shall destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will detest the bloody and deceitful man.

7. But as for me, I will come into your house in the multitude of your mercy: and in your fear will I worship toward your holy temple.

8. Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of mine enemies; make your way straight before my face.

9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open tomb; they flatter with their tongue.

10. Destroy you them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against you.

11. But let all those that put their trust in you rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because you defend them: let them also that love your name be joyful in you.

12. For you, LORD, will bless the righteous; with favour will you compass him as with a shield.

## Psalms 6

1. O LORD, rebuke me not in yours anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

2. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.

3. My soul is also sore vexed: but you, O LORD, how long?

4. Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for your mercies' sake.

5. For in death there is no remembrance of you: in the grave who shall give you thanks?

6. I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

7. Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxs old because of all mine enemies.

8. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.

9. The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.

10. Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.

## Psalms 7

1. O LORD my God, in you do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:

2. Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

3. O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

4. If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

5. Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O LORD, in yours anger, lift up yourself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that you have commanded.

7. So shall the congregation of the people compass you about: for their sakes therefore return you on high.

8. The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.

9. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God tries the hearts and reins.

10. My defence is of God, which saves the upright in heart.

11. God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.

12. If he turn not, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.

13. He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.

14. Behold, he labors with iniquity, and has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

15. He made a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.

16. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own crown of the head.

17. I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

## Psalms 8

1. O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth! who have set your glory above the heavens.

2. Out of the mouth of babes and infants have you ordained strength because of yours enemies, that you might still the enemy and the avenger.

3. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;

4. What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?

5. For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honour.

6. You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:

7. All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

8. The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the seas.

9. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth!

## Psalms 9

1. I will praise you, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will show forth all your marvellous works.

2. I will be glad and rejoice in you: I will sing praise to your name, O you most High.

3. When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at your presence.

4. For you have maintained my right and my cause; you sat in the throne judging right.

5. You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked, you have put out their name for ever and ever.

6. O you enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and you have destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

7. But the LORD shall endure for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment.

8. And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

9. The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

10. And they that know your name will put their trust in you: for you, LORD, have not forsaken them that seek you.

11. Sing praises to the LORD, which dwells in Zion: declare among the people his doings.

12. When he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them: he forgets not the cry of the humble.

13. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, you that lift me up from the gates of death:

14. That I may show forth all your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in your salvation.

15. The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

16. The LORD is known by the judgment which he executes: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

17. The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.

18. For the needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.

19. Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in your sight.

20. Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.

## Psalms 10

1. Why stand you far off, O LORD? why hide you yourself in times of trouble?

2. The wicked in his pride does persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.

3. For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, and blesses the covetous, whom the LORD detests.

4. The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

5. His ways are always grievous; your judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffs at them.

6. He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.

7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.

8. He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.

9. He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to catch the poor: he does catch the poor, when he draws him into his net.

10. He crouches, and humbles himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.

11. He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.

12. Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up yours hand: forget not the humble.

13. Wherefore does the wicked contemn God? he has said in his heart, You will not require it.

14. You have seen it; for you behold mischief and spite, to requite it with your hand: the poor commits himself unto you; you are the helper of the fatherless.

15. Break you the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till you find none.

16. The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.

17. LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble: you will prepare their heart, you will cause yours ear to hear:

18. To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

## Psalms 11

1. In the LORD put I my trust: how say all of you to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?

2. For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privately shoot at the upright in heart.

3. If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

4. The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

5. The LORD tries the righteous: but the wicked and him that loves violence his soul hates.

6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

7. For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; his countenance does behold the upright.

## Psalms 12

1. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.

2. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

3. The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things:

4. Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?

5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffs at him.

6. The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

7. You shall keep them, O LORD, you shall preserve them from this generation for ever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.

## Psalms 13

1. How long will you forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long will you hide your face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

3. Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;

4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

5. But I have trusted in your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.

6. I will sing unto the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me.

## Psalms 14

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that does good.

2. The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

3. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that does good, no, not one.

4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

5. There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.

6. All of you have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.

7. Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 15

1. Lord, who shall abide in your tabernacle? who shall dwell in your holy hill?

2. He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.

3. He that backbites not with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbour, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbour.

4. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honors them that fear the LORD. He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not.

5. He that puts not out his money to interest, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.

## Psalms 16

1. Preserve me, O God: for in you do I put my trust.

2. O my soul, you have said unto the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;

3. But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.

4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.

5. The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.

6. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

7. I will bless the LORD, who has given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.

8. I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.

10. For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer yours Holy One to see corruption.

11. You will show me the path of life: in your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

## Psalms 17

1. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips.

2. Let my sentence come forth from your presence; let yours eyes behold the things that are equal.

3. You have proved mine heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

4. Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

5. Hold up my activities in your paths, that my footsteps slip not.

6. I have called upon you, for you will hear me, O God: incline yours ear unto me, and hear my speech.

7. Show your marvellous loving kindness, O you that save by your right hand them which put their trust in you from those that rise up against them.

8. Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,

9. From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.

10. They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.

11. They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;

12. Like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.

13. Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is your sword:

14. From men which are your hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly you fill with your hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

15. As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness.

## Psalms 18

1. I will love you, O LORD, my strength.

2. The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

3. I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

4. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

5. The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.

6. In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.

7. Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was angry.

8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

9. He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.

10. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

11. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

12. At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.

13. The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

14. Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and humiliated them.

15. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

16. He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.

18. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.

19. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

20. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.

21. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.

23. I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

24. Therefore has the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

25. With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with an upright man you will show yourself upright;

26. With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the perverse you will show yourself perverse.

27. For you will save the afflicted people; but will bring down high looks.

28. For you will light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.

29. For by you I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

30. As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

31. For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

32. It is God that girds me with strength, and makes my way perfect.

33. He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me upon my high places.

34. He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

35. You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your right hand has held me up, and your gentleness has made me great.

36. You have enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

37. I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I return till they were consumed.

38. I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.

39. For you have girded me with strength unto the battle: you have subdued under me those that rose up against me.

40. You have also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.

41. They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.

42. Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

43. You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; and you have made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.

44. As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.

45. The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.

46. The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

47. It is God that avenges me, and subdues the people under me.

48. He delivers me from mine enemies: yea, you lift me up above those that rise up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.

49. Therefore will I give thanks unto you, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto your name.

50. Great deliverance gives he to his king; and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

## Psalms 19

1. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his handiwork.

2. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows knowledge.

3. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

4. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun,

5. Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.

6. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

7. The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

8. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

9. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

10. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

11. Moreover by them is your servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.

12. Who can understand his errors? cleanse you me from secret faults.

13. Keep back your servant also from arrogant sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

## Psalms 20

1. The LORD hear you in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend you;

2. Send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion;

3. Remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice; Selah.

4. Grant you according to yours own heart, and fulfill all your counsel.

5. We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfill all your petitions.

6. Now know I that the LORD saves his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

7. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

8. They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.

9. Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

## Psalms 21

1. The king shall joy in your strength, O LORD; and in your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

2. You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

3. For you prevent him with the blessings of goodness: you set a crown of pure gold on his head.

4. He asked life of you, and you gave it him, even length of days for ever and ever.

5. His glory is great in your salvation: honour and majesty have you laid upon him.

6. For you have made him most blessed for ever: you have made him exceeding glad with your countenance.

7. For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.

8. Yours hand shall find out all yours enemies: your right hand shall find out those that hate you.

9. You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of yours anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

10. Their fruit shall you destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

11. For they intended evil against you: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

12. Therefore shall you make them turn their back, when you shall make ready yours arrows upon your strings against the face of them.

13. Be you exalted, LORD, in yours own strength: so will we sing and praise your power.

## Psalms 22

1. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

2. O my God, I cry in the day time, but you hear not; and in the night season, and am not silent.

3. But you are holy, O you that inhabit the praises of Israel.

4. Our fathers trusted in you: they trusted, and you did deliver them.

5. They cried unto you, and were delivered: they trusted in you, and were not confounded.

6. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.

7. All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,

8. He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

9. But you are he that took me out of the womb: you did make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

10. I was cast upon you from the womb: you are my God from my mother's belly.

11. Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.

12. Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.

13. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.

14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.

16. For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

17. I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

18. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

19. But be not you far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste you to help me.

20. Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.

21. Save me from the lion's mouth: for you have heard me from the horns of the unicorns.

22. I will declare your name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise you.

23. All of you that fear the LORD, praise him; all you the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all you the seed of Israel.

24. For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.

25. My praise shall be of you in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

26. The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

27. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the families of the nations shall worship before you.

28. For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.

29. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.

30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.

31. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he has done this.

## Psalms 23

1. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not lack.

2. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: he leads me beside the still waters.

4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.

1. Unto you, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

2. O my God, I trust in you: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

3. Yea, let none that wait on you be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.

4. Show me your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths.

5. Lead me in your truth, and teach me: for you are the God of my salvation; on you do I wait all the day.

6. Remember, O LORD, your tender mercies and your loving kindnesses; for they have been ever of old.

7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to your mercy remember you me for your goodness' sake, O LORD.

8. Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.

9. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.

1. Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

2. Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

3. For your loving kindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in your truth.

4. I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.

5. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

6. I will wash mine hands in innocence: so will I compass yours altar, O LORD:

7. That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your wondrous works.

8. LORD, I have loved the habitation of your house, and the place where yours honour dwells.

9. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

10. In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

11. But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

12. My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.

## Psalms 27

1. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

3. Though an host should camp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

4. One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

5. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.

6. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

7. Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.

8. When you said, Seek all of you my face; my heart said unto you, Your face, LORD, will I seek.

9. Hide not your face far from me; put not your servant away in anger: you have been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.

10. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.

11. Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.

2. Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto you, when I lift up my hands toward your holy oracle.

3. Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.

4. Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.

5. Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.

6. Blessed be the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.

7. The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoices; and with my song will I praise him.

4. The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.

5. The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; yea, the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon.

8. The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

9. The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.

11. The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.

## Psalms 30

2. O LORD my God, I cried unto you, and you have healed me.

3. O LORD, you have brought up my soul from the grave: you have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

4. Sing unto the LORD, O all of you saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

5. For his anger endures but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.

6. And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

7. LORD, by your favour you have made my mountain to stand strong: you did hide your face, and I was troubled.

8. I cried to you, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

9. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? shall it declare your truth?

10. Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be you my helper.

11. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing: you have put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

12. To the end that my glory may sing praise to you, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto you for ever.

## Psalms 31

1. In you, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in your righteousness.

2. Bow down yours ear to me; deliver me speedily: be you my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

3. For you are my rock and my fortress; therefore for your name's sake lead me, and guide me.

4. Pull me out of the net that they have laid privately for me: for you are my strength.

5. Into yours hand I commit my spirit: you have redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.

6. I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.

7. I will be glad and rejoice in your mercy: for you have considered my trouble; you have known my soul in adversities;

8. And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: you have set my feet in a large room.

9. Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

10. For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength fails because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

11. I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.

12. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.

13. For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.

14. But I trusted in you, O LORD: I said, You are my God.

15. My times are in your hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.

16. Make your face to shine upon your servant: save me for your mercies' sake.

17. Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon you: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.

18. Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

19. Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for them that fear you; which you have wrought for them that trust in you before the sons of men!

20. You shall hide them in the secret of your presence from the pride of man: you shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

21. Blessed be the LORD: for he has showed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.

22. For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before yours eyes: nevertheless you heard the voice of my supplications when I cried unto you.

23. O love the LORD, all you his saints: for the LORD perserves the faithful, and plentifully rewards the proud doer.

24. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all you that hope in the LORD.

4. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

6. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto you in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

7. You are my hiding place; you shall preserve me from trouble; you shall compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

8. I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go: I will guide you with mine eye.

18. Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;

19. To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.

20. Our soul waits for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

21. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.

22. Let your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in you.

## Psalms 34

3. Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am your salvation.

10. All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto you, which deliver the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoils him?

11. False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.

12. They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

13. But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.

14. I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourns for his mother.

15. But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the outcasts gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:

24. Judge me, O LORD my God, according to your righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

25. Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

26. Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

27. Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

28. And my tongue shall speak of your righteousness and of your praise all the day long.

## Psalms 36

1. The transgression of the wicked says within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.

2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.

3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he has left off to be wise, and to do good.

4. He devises mischief upon his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he detests not evil.

5. Your mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and your faithfulness reachs unto the clouds.

6. Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.

7. How excellent is your loving kindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of your wings.

8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall make them drink of the river of your pleasures.

9. For with you is the fountain of life: in your light shall we see light.

4. Delight yourself also in the LORD: and he shall give you the desires of yours heart.

5. Commit your way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.

6. And he shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noonday.

7. Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not yourself because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.

8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not yourself in any way to do evil.

9. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

10. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, you shall diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

11. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

12. The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his teeth.

13. The LORD shall laugh at him: for he sees that his day is coming.

14. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.

15. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholds the righteous.

18. The LORD knows the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.

19. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

20. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

21. The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the righteous shows mercy, and gives.

22. For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

23. The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delights in his way.

24. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholds him with his hand.

25. I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

26. He is ever merciful, and lends; and his seed is blessed.

27. Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

28. For the LORD loves judgment, and forsakes not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

29. The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.

30. The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of judgment.

31. The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

32. The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.

33. The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.

34. Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt you to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

35. I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.

36. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.

37. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.

38. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.

39. But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.

40. And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

## Psalms 38

1. O lord, rebuke me not in your wrath: neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

2. For yours arrows stick fast in me, and your hand presses me sore.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of yours anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

4. For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

5. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

7. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the chaos of my heart.

9. Lord, all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hid from you.

10. My heart pants, my strength fails me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand far off.

12. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

13. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that opens not his mouth.

14. Thus I was as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

15. For in you, O LORD, do I hope: you will hear, O Lord my God.

16. For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.

17. For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.

18. For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19. But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

20. They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.

21. Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

22. Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

## Psalms 39

1. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.

2. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.

3. My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spoke I with my tongue,

4. LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

5. Behold, you have made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before you: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.

6. Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.

7. And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in you.

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.

9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because you did it.

10. Remove your stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of yours hand.

11. When you with rebukes do correct man for iniquity, you make his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not your peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with you, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

13. O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go behind, and be no more.

## Psalms 40

1. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

2. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my activities.

3. And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

4. Blessed is that man that makes the LORD his trust, and respects not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

5. Many, O LORD my God, are your wonderful works which you have done, and your thoughts which are toward us: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto you: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.

6. Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; mine ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.

7. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,

8. I delight to do your will, O my God: yea, your law is within my heart.

9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, you know.

10. I have not hid your righteousness within my heart; I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation: I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great congregation.

11. Withhold not you your tender mercies from me, O LORD: let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.

12. For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart fails me.

13. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.

14. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

15. Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

16. Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you: let such as love your salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

17. But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinks upon me: you are my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

## Psalms 41

1. Blessed is he that considers the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

2. The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and you will not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.

3. The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: you will make all his bed in his sickness.

4. I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against you.

5. Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?

6. And if he comes to see me, he speaks vanity: his heart gathers iniquity to itself; when he goes abroad, he tells it.

7. All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.

8. An evil disease, say they, cleaves fast unto him: and now that he lies he shall rise up no more.

9. Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.

10. But you, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

11. By this I know that you favour me, because mine enemy does not triumph over me.

12. And as for me, you uphold me in mine integrity, and set me before your face for ever.

13. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

## Psalms 42

1. As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God.

2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is your God?

4. When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted in me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.

6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.

7. Deep calls unto deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.

8. Yet the LORD will command his loving kindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.

9. I will say unto God my rock, Why have you forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

10. As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is your God?

11. Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2. For you are the God of my strength: why do you cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3. O send out your light and your truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto your holy hill, and to your tabernacles.

4. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise you, O God my God.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

## Psalms 44

1. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the times of old.

2. How you did drive out the heathen with your hand, and planted them; how you did afflict the people, and cast them out.

3. For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but your right hand, and yours arm, and the light of your countenance, because you had a favour unto them.

4. You are my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

5. Through you will we push down our enemies: through your name will we tread them under that rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

7. But you have saved us from our enemies, and have put them to shame that hated us.

8. In God we boast all the day long, and praise your name for ever. Selah.

9. But you have cast off, and put us to shame; and go not forth with our armies.

10. You make us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.

11. You have given us like sheep appointed for food; and have scattered us among the heathen.

12. You sell your people for nothing, and do not increase your wealth by their price.

13. You make us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.

14. You make us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.

15. My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face has covered me,

16. For the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemes; by reason of the enemy and avenger.

17. All this has come upon us; yet have we not forgotten you, neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.

18. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from your way;

19. Though you have sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;

21. Shall not God search this out? for he knows the secrets of the heart.

22. Yea, for your sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

23. Awake, why sleep you, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.

24. Wherefore hide you your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression?

25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaves unto the earth.

26. Arise for our help, and redeem us for your mercies' sake.

## Psalms 45

1. My heart is composing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made concerning the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

2. You are fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into your lips: therefore God has blessed you for ever.

3. Gird your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty, with your glory and your majesty.

4. And in your majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and your right hand shall teach you terrible things.

5. Yours arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under you.

6. Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of your kingdom is a right sceptre.

7. You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.

8. All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.

9. Kings' daughters were among your honourable women: upon your right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

10. Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline yours ear; forget also yours own people, and your father's house;

11. So shall the king greatly desire your beauty: for he is your Lord; and worship you him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall implore your favour.

13. The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.

14. She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto you.

15. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.

16. Instead of your fathers shall be your children, whom you may make princes in all the earth.

17. I will make your name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise you for ever and ever.

## Psalms 46

1. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

2. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

3. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

4. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.

6. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

7. The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

8. Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he has made in the earth.

9. He makes wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in two; he burns the chariot in the fire.

10. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

11. The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

## Psalms 47

1. O clap your hands, all you people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

2. For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.

3. He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

4. He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

5. God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

6. Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.

7. For God is the King of all the earth: sing all of you praises with understanding.

8. God reigns over the heathen: God sits upon the throne of his holiness.

9. The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

## Psalms 48

1. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

2. Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

3. God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

4. For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

5. They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.

6. Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

7. You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

8. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

9. We have thought of your loving kindness, O God, in the midst of your temple.

10. According to your name, O God, so is your praise unto the ends of the earth: your right hand is full of righteousness.

11. Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of your judgments.

12. Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.

13. Mark all of you well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that all of you may tell it to the generation following.

14. For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.

## Psalms 49

1. Hear this, all you people; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world:

2. Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

4. I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?

6. They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:

8. (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceases for ever:)

9. That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

10. For he sees that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

11. Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.

12. Nevertheless man being in honour abides not: he is like the beasts that perish.

13. This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.

14. Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

15. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.

16. Be not you afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;

17. For when he dies he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.

18. Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise you, when you do well to yourself.

19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

20. Man that is in honour, and understands not, is like the beasts that perish.

## Psalms 50

1. The mighty God, even the LORD, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined.

3. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.

5. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.

7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, even your God.

8. I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.

9. I will take no bullock out of your house, nor he goats out of your folds.

10. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

11. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.

13. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

14. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay your vows unto the most High:

15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.

16. But unto the wicked God says, What have you to do to declare my statutes, or that you should take my covenant in your mouth?

17. Seeing you hate instruction, and casts my words behind you.

18. When you saw a thief, then you consented with him, and have been partaker with adulterers.

19. You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.

20. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander yours own mother's son.

21. These things have you done, and I kept silence; you thought that I was altogether such an one as yourself: but I will reprove you, and set them in order before yours eyes.

22. Now consider this, all of you that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.

23. Whoso offers praise glorifies me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God.

## Psalms 51

1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to your loving kindness: according unto the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

3. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.

4. Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.

5. Behold, I was formed in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.

6. Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part you shall make me to know wisdom.

7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.

9. Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

10. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.

11. Cast me not away from your presence; and take not your holy spirit from me.

12. Restore unto me the joy of your salvation; and uphold me with your free spirit.

13. Then will I teach transgressors your ways; and sinners shall be converted unto you.

14. Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O God, you God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.

15. O Lord, open you my lips; and my mouth shall show forth your praise.

16. For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.

17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

18. Do good in your good pleasure unto Zion: build you the walls of Jerusalem.

19. Then shall you be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon yours altar.

## Psalms 52

1. Why boast you yourself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endures continually.

2. The tongue devises evil; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

3. You love evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.

4. You love all devouring words, O you deceitful tongue.

5. God shall likewise destroy you for ever, he shall take you away, and pluck you out of your dwelling place, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.

6. The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:

7. Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.

8. But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

9. I will praise you for ever, because you have done it: and I will wait on your name; for it is good before your saints.

## Psalms 53

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that does good.

2. God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

3. Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that does good, no, not one.

4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

5. There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God has scattered the bones of him that camps against you: you have put them to shame, because God has despised them.

6. Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 54

1. Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me by your strength.

2. Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

3. For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

4. Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

5. He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in your truth.

6. I will freely sacrifice unto you: I will praise your name, O LORD; for it is good.

7. For he has delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye has seen his desire upon mine enemies.

## Psalms 55

1. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not yourself from my supplication.

2. Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;

3. Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

4. My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

5. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.

6. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.

7. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.

8. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

9. Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

10. Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

11. Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

12. For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

13. But it was you, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.

14. We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.

15. Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

16. As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

17. Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.

18. He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.

19. God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abides of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

20. He has put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he has broken his covenant.

21. The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.

22. Cast your burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain you: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

23. But you, O God, shall bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in you.

## Psalms 56

1. Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresses me.

2. Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O you most High.

3. What time I am afraid, I will trust in you.

4. In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

5. Every day they shift my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.

6. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

7. Shall they escape by iniquity? in yours anger cast down the people, O God.

8. You tell my wanderings: put you my tears into your bottle: are they not in your book?

9. When I cry unto you, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.

10. In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.

11. In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.

12. Your vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto you.

13. For you have delivered my soul from death: will not you deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

## Psalms 57

1. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusts in you: yea, in the shadow of your wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities pass over.

2. I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performs all things for me.

3. He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

4. My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

5. Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be above all the earth.

6. They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have dug a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.

7. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.

8. Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

9. I will praise you, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto you among the nations.

10. For your mercy is great unto the heavens, and your truth unto the clouds.

11. Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens: let your glory be above all the earth.

## Psalms 58

1. Do all of you indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do all of you judge uprightly, O all of you sons of men?

2. Yea, in heart all of you work wickedness; all of you weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.

3. The wicked are cut off from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.

4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear;

5. Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.

6. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

7. Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bends his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

8. As a snail which melts, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.

9. Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

10. The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

11. So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judges in the earth.

## Psalms 59

1. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.

2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

3. For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

4. They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.

5. You therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

6. They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

7. Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, does hear?

8. But you, O LORD, shall laugh at them; you shall have all the heathen in derision.

9. Because of his strength will I wait upon you: for God is my defence.

10. The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.

11. Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by your power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

12. For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.

13. Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God rules in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.

14. And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

15. Let them wander up and down for food, and grudge if they be not satisfied.

16. But I will sing of your power; yea, I will sing aloud of your mercy in the morning: for you have been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.

17. Unto you, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.

## Psalms 60

1. O God, you have cast us off, you have scattered us, you have been displeased; O turn yourself to us again.

2. You have made the earth to tremble; you have broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shakes.

3. You have showed your people hard things: you have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.

4. You have given a banner to them that fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

5. That your beloved may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me.

6. God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

8. Moab is my pot for washing; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.

9. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

10. Will not you, O God, which had cast us off? and you, O God, which did not go out with our armies?

11. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

12. Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

## Psalms 61

1. Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

2. From the end of the earth will I cry unto you, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

3. For you have been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.

4. I will abide in your tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of your wings. Selah.

5. For you, O God, have heard my vows: you have given me the heritage of those that fear your name.

6. You will prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.

7. He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.

8. So will I sing praise unto your name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.

## Psalms 62

1. Truly my soul waits upon God: from him comes my salvation.

2. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.

3. How long will all of you imagine mischief against a man? all of you shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall all of you be, and as a tottering fence.

4. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

5. My soul, wait you only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

6. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.

7. In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

8. Trust in him at all times; all of you people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

9. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.

10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

11. God has spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongs unto God.

12. Also unto you, O Lord, belongs mercy: for you render to every man according to his work.

## Psalms 63

1. O God, you are my God; early will I seek you: my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;

2. To see your power and your glory, so as I have seen you in the sanctuary.

3. Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you.

4. Thus will I bless you while I live: I will lift up my hands in your name.

5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips:

6. When I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the night watches.

7. Because you have been my help, therefore in the shadow of your wings will I rejoice.

8. My soul follows hard after you: your right hand upholds me.

9. But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

10. They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.

11. But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

## Psalms 64

1. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

2. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

3. Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

4. That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

5. They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privately; they say, Who shall see them?

6. They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.

7. But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.

8. So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.

9. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.

10. The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

## Psalms 65

1. Praise waits for you, O God, in Sion: and unto you shall the vow be performed.

2. O you that hear prayer, unto you shall all flesh come.

3. Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, you shall purge them away.

4. Blessed is the man whom you choose, and cause to approach unto you, that he may dwell in your courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, even of your holy temple.

5. By terrible things in righteousness will you answer us, O God of our salvation; who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are far off upon the sea:

6. Which by his strength sets fast the mountains; being girded with power:

7. Which stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.

8. They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at your tokens: you make the utmost limit of the morning and evening to rejoice.

9. You visit the earth, and water it: you greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is full of water: you prepare them corn, when you have so provided for it.

10. You water the ridges thereof abundantly: you settle the furrows thereof: you make it soft with showers: you bless the springing thereof.

11. You crown the year with your goodness; and your paths drop fatness.

12. They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.

13. The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

## Psalms 66

1. Make a joyful noise unto God, all you lands:

2. Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

3. Say unto God, How terrible are you in your works! through the greatness of your power shall yours enemies submit themselves unto you.

4. All the earth shall worship you, and shall sing unto you; they shall sing to your name. Selah.

5. Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.

6. He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

7. He rules by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

8. O bless our God, all of you people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:

9. Which holds our soul in life, and suffers not our feet to be moved.

10. For you, O God, have proved us: you have tried us, as silver is tried.

11. You brought us into the net; you laid affliction upon our loins.

12. You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but you brought us out into a wealthy place.

13. I will go into your house with burnt offerings: I will pay you my vows,

14. Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken, when I was in trouble.

15. I will offer unto you burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

16. Come and hear, all you that fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul.

17. I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

19. But verily God has heard me; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.

20. Blessed be God, which has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

## Psalms 67

1. God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.

2. That your way may be known upon earth, your saving health among all nations.

6. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.

7. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

## Psalms 68

1. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.

2. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

3. But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

4. Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rides upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

5. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.

6. God sets the solitary in families: he brings out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.

7. O God, when you went forth before your people, when you did march through the wilderness; Selah:

8. The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

9. You, O God, did send a plentiful rain, whereby you did confirm yours inheritance, when it was weary.

10. Your congregation has dwelt therein: you, O God, have prepared of your goodness for the poor.

11. The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.

12. Kings of armies did flee swiftly: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.

13. Though all of you have lien among the pots, yet shall all of you be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

14. When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.

15. The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.

16. Why leap all of you, all of you high hills? this is the hill which God desires to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

17. The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.

18. You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

19. Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.

20. He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.

21. But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goes on still in his trespasses.

22. The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:

23. That your foot may be dipped in the blood of yours enemies, and the tongue of your dogs in the same.

24. They have seen your activities, O God; even the activities of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.

25. The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

26. Bless all of you God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.

27. There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.

28. Your God has commanded your strength: strengthen, O God, that which you have wrought for us.

29. Because of your temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto you.

30. Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter you the people that delight in war.

31. Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.

32. Sing unto God, all of you kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:

33. To him that rides upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he does send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

34. Ascribe all of you strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.

35. O God, you are terrible out of your holy places: the God of Israel is he that gives strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.

## Psalms 69

1. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

2. I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

3. I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.

4. They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.

5. O God, you know my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from you.

6. Let not them that wait on you, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek you be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

7. Because for your sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.

8. I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an foreigner unto my mother's children.

9. For the zeal of yours house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached you are fallen upon me.

10. When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.

11. I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.

12. They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.

13. But as for me, my prayer is unto you, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of your mercy hear me, in the truth of your salvation.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Let not the flood of waters overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

16. Hear me, O LORD; for your loving kindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of your tender mercies.

17. And hide not your face from your servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.

18. Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.

19. You have known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before you.

20. Reproach has broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.

21. They gave me also gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

22. Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

23. Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.

24. Pour out yours indignation upon them, and let your wrathful anger take hold of them.

25. Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.

26. For they persecute him whom you have smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom you have wounded.

27. Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into your righteousness.

28. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.

29. But I am poor and sorrowful: let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.

30. I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

31. This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that has horns and hoofs.

32. The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.

33. For the LORD hears the poor, and despises not his prisoners.

34. Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moves therein.

35. For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

36. The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

## Psalms 70

1. MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.

2. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

3. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.

4. Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you: and let such as love your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

5. But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: you are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

## Psalms 71

1. In you, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.

2. Deliver me in your righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline yours ear unto me, and save me.

3. Be you my strong habitation, unto which I may continually resort: you have given commandment to save me; for you are my rock and my fortress.

4. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

5. For you are my hope, O Lord GOD: you are my trust from my youth.

6. By you have I been held up from the womb: you are he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of you.

7. I am as a wonder unto many; but you are my strong refuge.

8. Let my mouth be filled with your praise and with your honour all the day.

9. Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.

10. For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,

11. Saying, God has forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.

12. O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

13. Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope continually, and will yet praise you more and more.

15. My mouth shall show forth your righteousness and your salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

16. I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours only.

17. O God, you have taught me from my youth: and until now have I declared your wondrous works.

18. Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have showed your strength unto this generation, and your power to every one that is to come.

19. Your righteousness also, O God, is very high, who have done great things: O God, who is like unto you!

20. You, which have showed me great and sore troubles, shall restore life in me again, and shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

21. You shall increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

22. I will also praise you with the psaltery, even your truth, O my God: unto you will I sing with the harp, O you Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto you; and my soul, which you have redeemed.

24. My tongue also shall talk of your righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.

## Psalms 72

1. Give the king your judgments, O God, and your righteousness unto the king's son.

2. He shall judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with judgment.

3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

4. He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

5. They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.

6. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.

7. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endures.

8. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.

9. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

11. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.

12. For he shall deliver the needy when he cries; the poor also, and him that has no helper.

13. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.

14. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

15. And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.

16. There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

17. His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.

18. Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only does wondrous things.

19. And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

## Psalms 73

1. Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.

2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

3. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

4. For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.

5. They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.

6. Therefore pride compasses them about as a chain; violence covers them as a garment.

7. Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.

8. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.

9. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.

10. Therefore his people return here: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.

11. And they say, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?

12. Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.

13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.

14. For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.

15. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of your children.

16. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

17. Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.

18. Surely you did set them in slippery places: you casted them down into destruction.

19. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.

20. As a dream when one awakes; so, O Lord, when you awake, you shall despise their image.

21. Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

22. So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before you.

23. Nevertheless I am continually with you: you have held me by my right hand.

24. You shall guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

25. Whom have I in heaven but you? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside you.

26. My flesh and my heart fails: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

27. For, lo, they that are far from you shall perish: you have destroyed all them that go a whoring from you.

28. But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all your works.

## Psalms 74

1. O God, why have you cast us off for ever? why does yours anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?

2. Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old; the rod of yours inheritance, which you have redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein you have dwelt.

3. Lift up your feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy has done wickedly in the sanctuary.

4. Yours enemies roar in the midst of your congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.

5. A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.

6. But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.

7. They have cast fire into your sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of your name to the ground.

8. They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

9. We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knows how long.

10. O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme your name for ever?

11. Why withdraw you your hand, even your right hand? pluck it out of your bosom.

12. For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

13. You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.

14. You brake the heads of leviathan (p. sea serpent) in pieces, and gave him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

15. You did cleave the fountain and the flood: you dried up mighty rivers.

16. The day is yours, the night also is yours: you have prepared the light and the sun.

17. You have set all the borders of the earth: you have made summer and winter.

18. Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed your name.

19. O deliver not the soul of your turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of your poor for ever.

20. Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

21. O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise your name.

22. Arise, O God, plead yours own cause: remember how the foolish man reproaches you daily.

23. Forget not the voice of yours enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against you increases continually.

## Psalms 75

1. Unto you, O God, do we give thanks, unto you do we give thanks: for that your name is near your wondrous works declare.

2. When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

3. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

4. I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:

5. Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

6. For promotion comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.

7. But God is the judge: he puts down one, and sets up another.

8. For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.

9. But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

## Psalms 76

1. In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

2. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.

3. There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

4. You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

5. The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.

6. At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

7. You, even you, are to be feared: and who may stand in your sight when once you are angry?

8. You did cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,

9. When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise you: the remainder of wrath shall you restrain.

11. Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

12. He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.

## Psalms 77

1. I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.

2. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

3. I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

4. You hold mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

5. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

6. I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

7. Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

8. Is his mercy clean gone for ever? does his promise fail for evermore?

9. Has God forgotten to be gracious? has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

10. And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.

11. I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember your wonders of old.

12. I will meditate also of all your work, and talk of your doings.

13. Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?

14. You are the God that do wonders: you have declared your strength among the people.

15. You have with yours arm redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

16. The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.

17. The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: yours arrows also went abroad.

18. The voice of your thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

19. Your way is in the sea, and your path in the great waters, and your footsteps are not known.

20. You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

1. Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:

3. Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

4. We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.

5. For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:

6. That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:

7. That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:

8. And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

9. The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

10. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;

11. And forgotten about his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.

12. Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.

14. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

15. He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.

16. He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

17. And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.

18. And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their lust.

19. Yea, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold, he stroke the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?

21. Therefore the LORD heard this, and was angry: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

22. Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:

23. Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,

24. And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.

25. Man did eat angels' food: he sent them food to the full.

26. He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.

27. He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like the sand of the sea:

28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.

29. So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;

30. They were not cut off from their lust. But while their food was yet in their mouths,

31. The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and stroke down the chosen men of Israel.

32. For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.

33. Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.

34. When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.

35. And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.

36. Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.

37. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.

38. But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

39. For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passes away, and comes not again.

40. How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!

41. Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.

42. They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.

43. How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.

44. And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.

45. He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

46. He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.

47. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.

48. He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

49. He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

50. He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

51. And stroke all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

52. But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

53. And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

54. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

55. He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

56. Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:

57. But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

59. When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel:

60. So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;

61. And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.

62. He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was angry with his inheritance.

63. The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.

64. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.

65. Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.

66. And he stroke his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.

67. Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:

68. But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

69. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established for ever.

70. He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:

71. From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

72. So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

## Psalms 79

1. O god, the heathen are come into yours inheritance; your holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

2. The dead bodies of your servants have they given to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of your saints unto the beasts of the earth.

3. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.

4. We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

5. How long, LORD? will you be angry for ever? shall your jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out your wrath upon the heathen that have not known you, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your name.

7. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.

8. O remember not against us former iniquities: let your tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for your name's sake.

10. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of your servants which is shed.

11. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you; according to the greatness of your power preserve you those that are appointed to die;

12. And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached you, O Lord.

13. So we your people and sheep of your pasture will give you thanks for ever: we will show forth your praise to all generations.

## Psalms 80

1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubims, shine forth.

2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up your strength, and come and save us.

3. Turn us again, O God, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.

4. O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?

5. You feed them with the bread of tears; and give them tears to drink in great measure.

6. You make us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.

7. Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.

8. You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.

9. You prepared room before it, and did cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.

10. The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.

11. She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.

12. Why have you then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?

13. The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.

14. Return, we plead to you, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

15. And the vineyard which your right hand has planted, and the branch that you made strong for yourself.

16. It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of your countenance.

17. Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.

18. So will not we go back from you: quicken us, and we will call upon your name.

19. Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved.

## Psalms 81

1. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.

2. Take a psalm, and bring here the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.

3. Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.

4. For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.

5. This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.

6. I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.

7. You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder: I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

8. Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto you: O Israel, if you will hearken unto me;

9. There shall no strange god be in you; neither shall you worship any strange god.

10. I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt: open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel refused me.

12. So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.

13. Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!

14. I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

15. The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.

16. He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you.

## Psalms 82

1. God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.

2. How long will all of you judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.

3. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.

4. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

5. They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

6. I have said, All of you are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.

7. But all of you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

8. Arise, O God, judge the earth: for you shall inherit all nations.

## Psalms 83

1. Keep not you silence, O God: hold not your peace, and be not still, O God.

2. For, lo, yours enemies make a tumult: and they that hate you have lifted up the head.

3. They have taken crafty counsel against your people, and consulted against your hidden ones.

4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

5. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against you:

6. The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

8. Assur also is joined with them: they have helped the children of Lot. Selah.

9. Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

10. Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

11. Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

12. Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

13. O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

14. As the fire burns a wood, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire;

15. So persecute them with your tempest, and make them afraid with your storm.

16. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek your name, O LORD.

17. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

18. That men may know that you, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, are the most high over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

1. How lovely are your tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

2. My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh cries out for the living God.

3. Yea, the sparrow has found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even yours altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

4. Blessed are they that dwell in your house: they will be still praising you. Selah.

5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; in whose heart are the ways of them.

6. Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also fills the pools.

7. They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.

8. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

9. Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of yours anointed.

10. For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

12. O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in you.

## Psalms 85

1. Lord, you have been favourable unto your land: you have brought back the captivity of Jacob.

2. You have forgiven the iniquity of your people, you have covered all their sin. Selah.

3. You have taken away all your wrath: you have turned yourself from the fierceness of yours anger.

4. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause yours anger toward us to cease.

5. Will you be angry with us for ever? will you draw out yours anger to all generations?

6. Will you not revive us again: that your people may rejoice in you?

7. Show us your mercy, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.

8. I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not return to folly.

9. Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.

10. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

11. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.

12. Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.

13. Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.

## Psalms 86

1. Bow down yours ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

2. Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O you my God, save your servant that trusts in you.

3. Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto you daily.

4. Rejoice the soul of your servant: for unto you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

5. For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive; and abundant in mercy unto all them that call upon you.

6. Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.

7. In the day of my trouble I will call upon you: for you will answer me.

8. Among the gods there is none like unto you, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto your works.

9. All nations whom you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord; and shall glorify your name.

10. For you are great, and do wondrous things: you are God alone.

11. Teach me your way, O LORD; I will walk in your truth: unite my heart to fear your name.

12. I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify your name for evermore.

13. For great is your mercy toward me: and you have delivered my soul from the low hell.

14. O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set you before them.

15. But you, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in mercy and truth.

16. O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give your strength unto your servant, and save the son of yours handmaid.

17. Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because you, LORD, have helped me, and comforted me.

## Psalms 87

1. His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.

4. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.

5. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

6. The LORD shall count, when he writes up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.

7. As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in you.

## Psalms 88

1. O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you:

2. Let my prayer come before you: incline yours ear unto my cry;

3. For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draws nigh unto the grave.

4. I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no strength:

5. Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no more: and they are cut off from your hand.

6. You have laid me in the low pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

7. Your wrath lies hard upon me, and you have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.

8. You have put away mine acquaintance far from me; you have made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

9. Mine eye mourns by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon you, I have stretched out my hands unto you.

10. Will you show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise you? Selah.

11. Shall your loving kindness be declared in the grave? or your faithfulness in destruction?

12. Shall your wonders be known in the dark? and your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

13. But unto you have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent you.

14. LORD, why cast you off my soul? why hide you your face from me?

15. I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer your terrors I am distracted.

16. Your fierce wrath goes over me; your terrors have cut me off.

17. They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.

18. Lover and friend have you put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.

## Psalms 89

1. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known your faithfulness to all generations.

2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: your faithfulness shall you establish in the very heavens.

3. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,

4. Your seed will I establish for ever, and build up your throne to all generations. Selah.

5. And the heavens shall praise your wonders, O LORD: your faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

6. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

7. God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

8. O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto you? or to your faithfulness round about you?

9. You rule the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, you still them.

10. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; you have scattered yours enemies with your strong arm.

11. The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours: as for the world and the fullness thereof, you have founded them.

12. The north and the south you have created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your name.

13. You have a mighty arm: strong is your hand, and high is your right hand.

14. Justice and judgment are the habitation of your throne: mercy and truth shall go before your face.

15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of your countenance.

16. In your name shall they rejoice all the day: and in your righteousness shall they be exalted.

17. For you are the glory of their strength: and in your favour our horn shall be exalted.

18. For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.

19. Then you spoke in vision to your holy one, and said, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.

20. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:

21. With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.

22. The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

23. And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.

24. But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

25. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.

26. He shall cry unto me, You are my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.

27. Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.

28. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.

29. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

30. If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

31. If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

32. Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.

33. Nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

34. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

35. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.

36. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.

37. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

38. But you have cast off and abhorred, you have been angry with yours anointed.

39. You have made void the covenant of your servant: you have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

40. You have broken down all his hedges; you have brought his strong holds to ruin.

41. All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.

42. You have set up the right hand of his adversaries; you have made all his enemies to rejoice.

43. You have also turned the edge of his sword, and have not made him to stand in the battle.

44. You have made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.

45. The days of his youth have you shortened: you have covered him with shame. Selah.

46. How long, LORD? will you hide yourself for ever? shall your wrath burn like fire?

47. Remember how short my time is: wherefore have you made all men in vain?

48. What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

49. Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you sware unto David in your truth?

50. Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

51. Wherewith yours enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of yours anointed.

52. Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

## Psalms 90

1. Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, before even you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.

3. You turn man to destruction; and says, Return, all of you children of men.

4. For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.

5. You carry them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which grows up.

6. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up; in the evening it is cut down, and withers.

7. For we are consumed by yours anger, and by your wrath are we troubled.

8. You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your countenance.

9. For all our days are passed away in your wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.

10. The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

11. Who knows the power of yours anger? even according to your fear, so is your wrath.

12. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

13. Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent you concerning your servants.

14. O satisfy us early with your mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

15. Make us glad according to the days wherein you have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

16. Let your work appear unto your servants, and your glory unto their children.

17. And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish you the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish you it.

## Psalms 91

1. He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

2. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

3. Surely he shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the dangerous pestilence.

4. He shall cover you with his feathers, and under his wings shall you trust: his truth shall be your shield and buckler.

5. You shall not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flies by day;

6. Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.

7. A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come nigh you.

8. Only with yours eyes shall you behold and see the reward of the wicked.

9. Because you have made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, your habitation;

10. There shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come nigh your dwelling.

11. For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.

12. They shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone.

13. You shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet.

14. Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he has known my name.

15. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

16. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.

## Psalms 92

1. IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO Your NAME, O MOST HIGH:

2. To show forth your loving kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night,

3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.

4. For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work: I will triumph in the works of your hands.

5. O LORD, how great are your works! and your thoughts are very deep.

6. A brutish man knows not; neither does a fool understand this.

7. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:

8. But you, LORD, are most high for evermore.

9. For, lo, yours enemies, O LORD, for, lo, yours enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

10. But my horn shall you exalt like the horn of an unicorn (p. ox): I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

11. Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.

12. The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13. Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;

15. To show that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

## Psalms 93

1. The LORD reigns, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he has girded himself: the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.

2. Your throne is established of old: you are from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

4. The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

5. Your testimonies are very sure: holiness becomes yours house, O LORD, for ever.

## Psalms 94

1. O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself.

2. Lift up yourself, you judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.

3. LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?

4. How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?

5. They break in pieces your people, O LORD, and afflict yours heritage.

6. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

7. Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.

8. Understand, all of you brutish among the people: and all of you fools, when will all of you be wise?

9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?

10. He that chastises the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?

11. The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

12. Blessed is the man whom you chasten, O LORD, and teach him out of your law;

13. That you may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be dug for the wicked.

14. For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.

15. But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

17. Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.

18. When I said, My foot slips; your mercy, O LORD, held me up.

19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me your comforts delight my soul.

20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, which frames mischief by a law?

21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

22. But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.

23. And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.

## Psalms 95

1. O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.

3. For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

4. In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.

5. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.

6. O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.

7. For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if all of you will hear his voice,

8. Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

9. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

10. Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways:

11. Unto whom I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.

## Psalms 96

1. O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.

2. Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day.

3. Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.

4. For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.

5. For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

6. Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

7. Give unto the LORD, O all of you families of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

8. Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.

9. O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.

10. Say among the heathen that the LORD reigns: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.

11. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.

12. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice

13. Before the LORD: for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

## Psalms 97

1. The LORD reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.

2. Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.

3. A fire goes before him, and burns up his enemies round about.

4. His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.

5. The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

6. The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.

7. Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.

8. Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments, O LORD.

9. For you, LORD, are high above all the earth: you are exalted far above all gods.

10. All of you that love the LORD, hate evil: he perserves the souls of his saints; he delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

12. Rejoice in the LORD, all of you righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

## Psalms 98

1. O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he has done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, has got him the victory.

2. The LORD has made known his salvation: his righteousness has he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.

3. He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

4. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

5. Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.

6. With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.

7. Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

8. Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together

9. Before the LORD; for he comes to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.

## Psalms 99

1. The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

2. The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.

3. Let them praise your great and terrible name; for it is holy.

4. The king's strength also loves judgment; you do establish equity, you execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

5. Exalt all of you the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.

6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

7. He spoke unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

8. You answered them, O LORD our God: you were a God that forgave them, though you took vengeance of their inventions.

9. Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

## Psalms 100

1. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all you lands.

2. Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

3. Know all of you that the LORD he is God: it is he that has made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

4. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

5. For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures to all generations.

## Psalms 101

1. I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto you, O LORD, will I sing.

2. I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when will you come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

4. A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.

5. Whoso privately slanders his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that has an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.

6. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walks in a perfect way, he shall serve me.

7. He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.

8. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

## Psalms 102

1. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto you.

2. Hide not your face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline yours ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.

3. For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.

4. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.

5. By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.

7. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

8. Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.

9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.

10. Because of yours indignation and your wrath: for you have lifted me up, and cast me down.

11. My days are like a shadow that declines; and I am withered like grass.

12. But you, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and your remembrance unto all generations.

13. You shall arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, has come.

14. For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.

15. So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.

16. When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

17. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.

18. This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

19. For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;

21. To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

22. When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.

23. He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

24. I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: your years are throughout all generations.

25. Of old have you laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of your hands.

26. They shall perish, but you shall endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shall you change them, and they shall be changed:

27. But you are the same, and your years shall have no end.

28. The children of your servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before you.

## Psalms 103

1. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

2. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

3. Who forgives all yours iniquities; who heals all your diseases;

4. Who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies;

5. Who satisfies your mouth with good things; so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.

6. The LORD executes righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.

7. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.

8. The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.

9. He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.

10. He has not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

11. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

13. Like a father pities his children, so the LORD pities them that fear him.

14. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.

15. As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.

17. But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;

18. To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.

19. The LORD has prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over all.

20. Bless the LORD, all of you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

21. Bless all of you the LORD, all you his hosts; all of you ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

22. Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.

## Psalms 104

1. Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with honour and majesty.

2. Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:

3. Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters: who makes the clouds his chariot: who walks upon the wings of the wind:

4. Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

5. Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.

6. You covered it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

7. At your rebuke they fled; at the voice of your thunder they hasted away.

8. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which you have founded for them.

9. You have set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

10. He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.

11. They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.

12. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.

13. He waters the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.

14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

15. And wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthens man's heart.

16. The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;

17. Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.

18. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.

19. He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down.

20. You make darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.

21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.

22. The sun arises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.

23. Man goes forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

24. O LORD, how manifold are your works! in wisdom have you made them all: the earth is full of your riches.

25. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.

26. There go the ships: there is that leviathan (p. sea serpent), whom you have made to play therein.

27. These wait all upon you; that you may give them their food in due season.

28. That you give them they gather: you open yours hand, they are filled with good.

29. You hide your face, they are troubled: you take away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

30. You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.

31. The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.

32. He looks on the earth, and it trembles: he touches the hills, and they smoke.

33. I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

34. My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.

35. Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless you the LORD, O my soul. Praise all of you the LORD.

## Psalms 105

1. O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.

2. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk all of you of all his wondrous works.

3. Glory all of you in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

4. Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

5. Remember his marvellous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

6. O all of you seed of Abraham his servant, all of you children of Jacob his chosen.

7. He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

8. He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.

9. Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

10. And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:

11. Saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:

12. When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.

13. When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;

14. He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;

15. Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

16. Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.

17. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:

18. Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

19. Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.

20. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

21. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

22. To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.

23. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.

25. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtlely with his servants.

26. He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

27. They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.

29. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

30. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.

32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

33. He stroke their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.

34. He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,

35. And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.

36. He stroke also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.

37. He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.

40. The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.

42. For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:

44. And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;

45. That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise all of you the LORD.

## Psalms 106

1. Praise all of you the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.

2. Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can show forth all his praise?

3. Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that does righteousness at all times.

4. Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that you bear unto your people: O visit me with your salvation;

5. That I may see the good of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with yours inheritance.

6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers understood not your wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of your mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.

8. Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

9. He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

10. And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11. And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.

12. Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

13. They soon forgotten about his works; they waited not for his counsel:

14. But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.

15. And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

16. They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.

17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.

18. And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

20. Thus they changed their glory into the embodiment of an ox that eats grass.

21. They forgotten about God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;

22. Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.

23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

24. Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

25. But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.

26. Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:

27. To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

28. They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.

30. Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.

31. And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.

32. They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:

33. Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke without due consideration with his lips.

34. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:

35. But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

36. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,

38. And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

39. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.

40. Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

41. And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.

42. Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

43. Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

44. Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:

45. And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

46. He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

47. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto your holy name, and to triumph in your praise.

48. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise all of you the LORD.

## Psalms 107

1. O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.

2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy;

3. And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

4. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.

5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

6. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.

7. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.

8. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

9. For he satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness.

10. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;

11. Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:

12. Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.

13. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in two.

15. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

16. For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in two.

17. Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

18. Their soul detests all manner of food; and they draw near unto the gates of death.

19. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saves them out of their distresses.

20. He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.

21. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.

23. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;

24. These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

25. For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves thereof.

26. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.

27. They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their know's end.

28. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.

29. He makes the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.

30. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he brings them unto their desired haven.

31. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

32. Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.

33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the fountains into dry ground;

34. A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

35. He turns the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into fountains.

36. And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;

37. And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.

38. He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffers not their cattle to decrease.

39. Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.

40. He pours contempt upon princes, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.

41. Yet sets he the poor on high from affliction, and makes him families like a flock.

42. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

43. Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the LORD.

## Psalms 108

1. O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

2. Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

3. I will praise you, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto you among the nations.

4. For your mercy is great above the heavens: and your truth reachs unto the clouds.

5. Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens: and your glory above all the earth;

6. That your beloved may be delivered: save with your right hand, and answer me.

7. God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

9. Moab is my pot for washing; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.

10. Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

11. Will not you, O God, who have cast us off? and will not you, O God, go forth with our hosts?

12. Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

13. Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

## Psalms 109

1. Hold not your peace, O God of my praise;

2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

3. They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

4. For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.

5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

6. Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.

7. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.

8. Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

10. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

11. Let the extortionist catch all that he has; and let the strangers spoil his labour.

12. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.

13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

15. Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

16. Because that he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

17. As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

18. As he clothed himself with cursing like with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

19. Let it be unto him as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

20. Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.

21. But do you for me, O GOD the Lord, for your name's sake: because your mercy is good, deliver you me.

22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

23. I am gone like the shadow when it declines: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

24. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh fails of fatness.

25. I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shook their heads.

26. Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to your mercy:

27. That they may know that this is your hand; that you, LORD, have done it.

28. Let them curse, but bless you: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let your servant rejoice.

29. Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

30. I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

31. For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.

## Psalms 110

1. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make yours enemies your footstool.

2. The LORD shall send the rod of your strength out of Zion: rule you in the midst of yours enemies.

3. Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.

4. The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

5. The Lord at your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.

6. He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.

7. He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.

## Psalms 111

8. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.

9. He sent redemption unto his people: he has commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endures for ever.

## Psalms 112

1. Praise all of you the LORD. Blessed is the man that fears the LORD, that delights greatly in his commandments.

2. His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

3. Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endures for ever.

4. Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

5. A good man shows favour, and lends: he will guide his affairs with discretion.

6. Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

7. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.

8. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.

9. He has dispersed, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.

10. The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

## Psalms 113

1. Praise all of you the LORD. Praise, O all of you servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.

2. Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.

3. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.

4. The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.

5. Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwells on high,

6. Who humbles himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!

7. He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the dunghill;

8. That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.

9. He makes the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise all of you the LORD.

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

2. Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

3. The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

4. The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.

5. What ailed you, O you sea, that you fled? you Jordan, that you were driven back?

6. All of you mountains, that all of you skipped like rams; and all of you little hills, like lambs?

7. Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

8. Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

## Psalms 115

1. Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto your name give glory, for your mercy, and for your truth's sake.

2. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

3. But our God is in the heavens: he has done whatsoever he has pleased.

4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

5. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:

6. They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:

7. They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

8. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusts in them.

9. O Israel, trust you in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.

13. He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

14. The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.

15. All of you are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

16. The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth has he given to the children of men.

170. Let my supplication come before you: deliver me according to your word.

171. My lips shall utter praise, when you have taught me your statutes.

172. My tongue shall speak of your word: for all your commandments are righteousness.

173. Let yours hand help me; for I have chosen your precepts.

174. I have longed for your salvation, O LORD; and your law is my delight.

175. Let my soul live, and it shall praise you; and let your judgments help me.

176. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant; for I do not forget your commandments.

4. Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

5. Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

3. The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

4. The LORD is righteous: he has cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

5. Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

6. Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withers before it grows up:

7. Wherewith the mower fills not his hand; nor he that binds sheaves his bosom.

1. Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

2. How he swore unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;

3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;

4. I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,

5. Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.

6. Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.

7. We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

8. Arise, O LORD, into your rest; you, and the ark of your strength.

9. Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints shout for joy.

10. For your servant David's sake turn not away the face of yours anointed.

11. The LORD has sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body will I set upon your throne.

12. If your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon your throne for evermore.

16. I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

17. There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

18. His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.

## Psalms 133

1. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!

2. It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;

3. As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.

## Psalms 134

1. Behold, bless all of you the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.

4. For the LORD has chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his exclusive treasure.

5. For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.

6. Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

7. He causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain; he brings the wind out of his treasuries.

8. Who stroke the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

9. Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

10. Who stroke great nations, and slew mighty kings;

11. Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:

12. And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.

13. Your name, O LORD, endures for ever; and your memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

14. For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.

15. The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

16. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;

17. They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.

18. They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusts in them.

19. Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:

20. Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: all of you that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.

## Psalms 137

1. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

2. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

3. For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us delight, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

4. How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

6. If I do not remember you, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

7. Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Demolish it, demolish it, even to the foundation thereof.

8. The LORD will perfect that which concerns me: your mercy, O LORD, endures for ever: forsake not the works of yours own hands.

## Psalms 139

1. O lord, you have searched me, and known me.

2. You know my sitting down and mine rising up, you understand my thought far off.

3. You compass my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.

4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, you know it altogether.

5. You have beset me behind and before, and laid yours hand upon me.

6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.

7. Where shall I go from your spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?

8. If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.

9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

10. Even there shall your hand lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.

11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.

12. Yea, the darkness hides not from you; but the night shines as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to you.

13. For you have possessed my reins: you have covered me in my mother's womb.

14. I will praise you; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are your works; and that my soul knows right well.

15. My substance was not hid from you, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the low parts of the earth.

17. How precious also are your thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!

18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with you.

19. Surely you will slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, all of you bloody men.

20. For they speak against you wickedly, and yours enemies take your name in vain.

21. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate you? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against you?

22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:

24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

## Psalms 140

6. I said unto the LORD, You are my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.

7. O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.

8. Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

9. As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

10. Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

11. Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

12. I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.

13. Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto your name: the upright shall dwell in your presence.

## Psalms 141

1. Lord, I cry unto you: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto you.

2. Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

3. Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

4. Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.

5. Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.

6. When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.

7. Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cuts and cleaves wood upon the earth.

8. But mine eyes are unto you, O GOD the Lord: in you is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.

10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I likewise escape.

## Psalms 142

1. I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.

2. I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble.

3. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then you knew my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privately laid a snare for me.

4. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.

5. I cried unto you, O LORD: I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.

6. Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

7. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise your name: the righteous shall compass me about; for you shall deal bountifully with me.

## Psalms 143

1. Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in your faithfulness answer me, and in your righteousness.

2. And enter not into judgment with your servant: for in your sight shall no man living be justified.

3. For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has smitten my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.

4. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.

5. I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your works; I meditate on the work of your hands.

6. I stretch forth my hands unto you: my soul thirsts after you, as a thirsty land. Selah.

7. Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit fails: hide not your face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

8. Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning; for in you do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto you.

9. Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto you to hide me.

10. Teach me to do your will; for you are my God: your spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

11. Restore life in me, O LORD, for your name's sake: for your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

12. And of your mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am your servant.

## Psalms 144

1. Blessed be the LORD my strength which teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:

2. My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdues my people under me.

3. LORD, what is man, that you take knowledge of him! or the son of man, that you make account of him!

4. Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passes away.

5. Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

6. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out yours arrows, and destroy them.

7. Send yours hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;

8. Whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

9. I will sing a new song unto you, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto you.

10. It is he that gives salvation unto kings: who delivers David his servant from the hurtful sword.

11. Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:

12. That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the embodiment of a palace:

13. That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:

14. That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.

15. Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.

## Psalms 145

2. While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.

3. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.

4. His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

5. Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:

6. Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keeps truth for ever:

7. Which executes judgment for the oppressed: which gives food to the hungry. The LORD looses the prisoners:

8. The LORD opens the eyes of the blind: the LORD raises them that are bowed down: the LORD loves the righteous:

9. The LORD perserves the strangers; he relieves the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.

10. The LORD shall reign for ever, even your God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise all of you the LORD.

8. Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:

9. Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

10. Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

11. Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:

12. Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

13. Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

14. He also exalts the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise all of you the LORD.
