# Deuteronomy

## Deuteronomy 1

1. These be the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite to the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

2. (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

3. And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;

4. After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:

5. On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,

6. The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, All of you have dwelt long enough in this mount:

7. Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

8. Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

9. And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:

10. The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, all of you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

11. (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as all of you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!)

12. How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?

13. Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

14. And all of you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.

15. So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

16. And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

17. All of you shall not respect persons in judgment; but all of you shall hear the small as well as the great; all of you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

18. And I commanded you at that time all the things which all of you should do.

19. And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which all of you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

20. And I said unto you, All of you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give unto us.

21. Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said unto you; fear not, neither be discouraged.

22. And all of you came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.

23. And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:

24. And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

25. And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.

26. Notwithstanding all of you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:

27. And all of you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

28. Where shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.

29. Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

30. The LORD your God which goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

31. And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bare you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that all of you went, until all of you came into this place.

32. Yet in this thing all of you did not believe the LORD your God,

33. Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way all of you should go, and in a cloud by day.

34. And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,

35. Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers.

36. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.

37. Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in thither.

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

39. Moreover your little ones, which all of you said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.

40. But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

41. Then all of you answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when all of you had girded on every man his weapons of war, all of you were ready to go up into the hill.

42. And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest all of you be smitten before your enemies.

43. So I spoke unto you; and all of you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

44. And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.

45. And all of you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

46. So all of you abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that all of you abode there.

## Deuteronomy 2

1. Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.

2. And the LORD spoke unto me, saying,

3. All of you have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.

4. And command you the people, saying, All of you are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take all of you good heed unto yourselves therefore:

5. Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.

6. All of you shall buy food of them for money, that all of you may eat; and all of you shall also buy water of them for money, that all of you may drink.

7. For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the works of your hand: he knows your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.

8. And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

9. And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.

10. The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;

11. Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.

12. The Horims also dwelt in Seir in time past; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their position; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

13. Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.

14. And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore unto them.

15. For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.

16. So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,

17. That the LORD spoke unto me, saying,

18. You are to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

19. And when you come nigh opposite to the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.

20. (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

21. A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their position:

22. As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their position even unto this day:

23. And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their position.)

24. Rise all of you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into yours hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.

25. This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.

26. And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

27. Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

28. You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;

29. (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.

30. But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.

31. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.

32. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.

33. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we stroke him, and his sons, and all his people.

34. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:

35. Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.

36. From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:

37. Only unto the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

## Deuteronomy 3

1. Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

2. And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do unto him as you did unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

3. So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we stroke him until none was left to him remaining.

4. And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

5. All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside towns without protective walls a great many.

6. And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

7. But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.

8. And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

9. (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)

10. All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

11. For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

12. And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

13. And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

14. Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

15. And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

16. And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

17. The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

18. And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: all of you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.

19. But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that all of you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;

20. Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond Jordan: and then shall all of you return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

21. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Yours eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms where you pass.

22. All of you shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.

23. And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

24. O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?

25. I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

26. But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice you; speak no more unto me of this matter.

27. Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up yours eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with yours eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.

28. But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.

29. So we abode in the valley opposite to Bethpeor.

## Deuteronomy 4

1. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, in order to do them, that all of you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.

2. All of you shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall all of you diminish ought from it, that all of you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

3. Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.

4. But all of you that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.

5. Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that all of you should do so in the land where all of you go to possess it.

6. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.

7. For what nation is there so great, who has God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?

8. And what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

9. Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which yours eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them your sons, and your sons' sons;

10. Specially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.

11. And all of you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

12. And the LORD spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire: all of you heard the voice of the words, but saw no embodiment; only all of you heard a voice.

13. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.

14. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that all of you might do them in the land where all of you go over to possess it.

15. Take all of you therefore good heed unto yourselves; for all of you saw no manner of embodiment on the day that the LORD spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

16. Lest all of you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the embodiment of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

17. The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,

18. The likeness of any thing that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

19. And lest you lift up yours eyes unto heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.

20. But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as all of you are this day.

21. Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:

22. But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but all of you shall go over, and possess that good land.

23. Take heed unto yourselves, lest all of you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you.

24. For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

25. When you shall brought forth children, and children's children, and all of you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:

26. I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that all of you shall soon utterly perish from off the land unto which all of you go over Jordan to possess it; all of you shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

27. And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and all of you shall be left few in number among the heathen, where the LORD shall lead you.

28. And there all of you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

29. But if from thence you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.

30. When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come upon you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient unto his voice;

31. (For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore unto them.

32. For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?

33. Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?

34. Or has God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

35. Unto you it was showed, that you might know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.

36. Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and upon earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.

37. And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;

38. To drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you are, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.

39. Know therefore this day, and consider it in yours heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

40. You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days upon the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.

41. Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;

42. That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unexpectedly, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

43. Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.

44. And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:

45. These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.

46. On this side Jordan, in the valley opposite to Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel stroke, after they were come forth out of Egypt:

47. And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;

48. From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,

49. And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

## Deuteronomy 5

1. And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that all of you may learn them, and keep, and do them.

2. The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

3. The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

4. The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,

5. (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for all of you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

6. I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

7. You shall have no other gods before me.

8. You shall not make you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

9. You shall not bow down yourself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,

10. And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.

11. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

12. Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.

13. Six days you shall labour, and do all your work:

14. But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor yours ox, nor yours ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.

15. And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.

16. Honour your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.

17. You shall not kill.

18. Neither shall you commit adultery.

19. Neither shall you steal.

20. Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbour.

21. Neither shall you desire your neighbour's wife, neither shall you covet your neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is your neighbour's.

22. These words the LORD spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

23. And it came to pass, when all of you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that all of you came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;

24. And all of you said, Behold, the LORD our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.

25. Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.

26. For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?

27. Go you near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak you unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto you; and we will hear it, and do it.

28. And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when all of you spoke unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto you: they have well said all that they have spoken.

29. O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!

30. Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

31. But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak unto you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.

32. All of you shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God has commanded you: all of you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

33. All of you shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that all of you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that all of you may prolong your days in the land which all of you shall possess.

## Deuteronomy 6

1. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that all of you might do them in the land where all of you go to possess it:

2. That you might fear the LORD your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.

3. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that all of you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.

4. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

5. And you shall love the LORD your God with all yours heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.

6. And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in yours heart:

7. And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in yours house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.

8. And you shall bind them for a sign upon yours hand, and they shall be as frontlets between yours eyes.

9. And you shall write them upon the posts of your house, and on your gates.

10. And it shall be, when the LORD your God shall have brought you into the land which he swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities, which you builded not,

11. And houses full of all good things, which you filled not, and wells dug, which you dug not, vineyards and olive trees, which you planted not; when you shall have eaten and be full;

12. Then beware lest you forget the LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

13. You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.

14. All of you shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;

15. (For the LORD your God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and destroy you from off the face of the earth.

16. All of you shall not tempt the LORD your God, as all of you tempted him in Massah.

17. All of you shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.

18. And you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore unto your fathers.

19. To cast out all yours enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.

20. And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God has commanded you?

21. Then you shall say unto your son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:

22. And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:

23. And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers.

24. And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.

25. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.

## Deuteronomy 7

1. When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;

2. And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall strike them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them:

3. Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give unto his son, nor his daughter shall you take unto your son.

4. For they will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy you suddenly.

5. But thus shall all of you deal with them; all of you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

6. For you are an holy people unto the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

7. The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because all of you were more in number than any people; for all of you were the few of all people:

8. But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, has the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

9. Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, which keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

10. And repays them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hates him, he will repay him to his face.

11. You shall therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you this day, to do them.

12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, if all of you hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD your God shall keep unto you the covenant and the mercy which he swore unto your fathers:

13. And he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you: he will also bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your land, your corn, and your wine, and yours oil, the increase of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep, in the land which he swore unto your fathers to give you.

14. You shall be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

15. And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, upon you; but will lay them upon all them that hate you.

16. And you shall consume all the people which the LORD your God shall deliver you; yours eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto you.

17. If you shall say in yours heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?

18. You shall not be afraid of them: but shall well remember what the LORD your God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

19. The great temptations which yours eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD your God brought you out: so shall the LORD your God do unto all the people of whom you are afraid.

20. Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from you, be destroyed.

21. You shall not be affrighted at them: for the LORD your God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.

22. And the LORD your God will put out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon you.

23. But the LORD your God shall deliver them unto you, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

24. And he shall deliver their kings into yours hand, and you shall destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.

25. The graven images of their gods shall all of you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto you, lest you be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.

26. Neither shall you bring an abomination into yours house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly detest it; for it is a cursed thing.

## Deuteronomy 8

1. All the commandments which I command you this day shall all of you observe to do, that all of you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers.

2. And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in yours heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.

3. And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.

4. Your raiment waxed not old upon you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.

5. You shall also consider in yours heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.

6. Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

7. For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;

8. A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

9. A land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig brass.

10. When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.

11. Beware that you forget not the LORD your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command you this day:

12. Lest when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;

13. And when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;

14. Then yours heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;

15. Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;

16. Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers knew not, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;

17. And you say in yours heart, My power and the might of mine hand has got me this wealth.

18. But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore unto your fathers, as it is this day.

19. And it shall be, if you do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that all of you shall surely perish.

20. As the nations which the LORD destroys before your face, so shall all of you perish; because all of you would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.

## Deuteronomy 9

1. Hear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,

2. A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!

3. Understand therefore this day, that the LORD your God is he which goes over before you; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before your face: so shall you drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has said unto you.

4. Speak not you in yours heart, after that the LORD your God has cast them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD does drive them out from before you.

5. Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of yours heart, do you go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

6. Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.

7. Remember, and forget not, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you did depart out of the land of Egypt, until all of you came unto this place, all of you have been rebellious against the LORD.

8. Also in Horeb all of you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.

9. When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

10. And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

11. And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.

12. And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get you down quickly from behind; for your people which you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

13. Furthermore the LORD spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stubborn people:

14. Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.

15. So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

16. And I looked, and, behold, all of you had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: all of you had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

17. And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.

18. And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which all of you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

19. For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was angry against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.

20. And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

21. And I took your sin, the calf which all of you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.

22. And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, all of you provoked the LORD to wrath.

23. Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then all of you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and all of you believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

24. All of you have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.

25. Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.

26. I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and yours inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

27. Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

28. Lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.

29. Yet they are your people and yours inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.

## Deuteronomy 10

1. At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew you two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make you an ark of wood.

2. And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.

3. And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.

4. And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.

5. And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.

6. And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his position.

7. From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

8. At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

9. Wherefore Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.

10. And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you.

11. And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.

12. And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,

13. To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?

14. Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's your God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

15. Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.

16. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stubborn.

17. For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:

18. He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

19. Love all of you therefore the stranger: for all of you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

20. You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you cleave, and swear by his name.

21. He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which yours eyes have seen.

22. Your fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude.

## Deuteronomy 11

1. Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always.

2. And know all of you this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

3. And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

4. And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them unto this day;

5. And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until all of you came into this place;

6. And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

7. But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.

8. Therefore shall all of you keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that all of you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where all of you go to possess it;

9. And that all of you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that flows with milk and honey.

10. For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence all of you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:

11. But the land, where all of you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:

12. A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

13. And it shall come to pass, if all of you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

14. That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and yours oil.

15. And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full.

16. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and all of you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

17. And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest all of you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.

18. Therefore shall all of you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.

19. And all of you shall teach them your children, speaking of them when you sit in yours house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

20. And you shall write them upon the door posts of yours house, and upon your gates:

21. That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

22. For if all of you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

23. Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and all of you shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

24. Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

25. There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that all of you shall tread upon, as he has said unto you.

26. Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

27. A blessing, if all of you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:

28. And a curse, if all of you will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which all of you have not known.

29. And it shall come to pass, when the LORD your God has brought you in unto the land where you go to possess it, that you shall put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

30. Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign opposite to Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

31. For all of you shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God gives you, and all of you shall possess it, and dwell therein.

32. And all of you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

## Deuteronomy 12

1. These are the statutes and judgments, which all of you shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of your fathers gives you to possess it, all the days that all of you live upon the earth.

2. All of you shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which all of you shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

3. And all of you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and all of you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

4. All of you shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

5. But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall all of you seek, and thither you shall come:

6. And thither all of you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:

7. And there all of you shall eat before the LORD your God, and all of you shall rejoice in all that all of you put your hand unto, all of you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.

8. All of you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

9. For all of you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.

10. But when all of you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that all of you dwell in safety;

11. Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall all of you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which all of you vow unto the LORD:

12. And all of you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, all of you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he has no part nor inheritance with you.

13. Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:

14. But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.

15. Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatsoever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

16. Only all of you shall not eat the blood; all of you shall pour it upon the earth as water.

17. You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of yours hand:

18. But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put yours hands unto.

19. Take heed to yourself that you forsake not the Levite as long as you live upon the earth.

20. When the LORD your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, whatsoever your soul lusts after.

21. If the place which the LORD your God has chosen to put his name there be too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and you shall eat in your gates whatsoever your soul lusts after.

22. Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you shall eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

23. Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the flesh.

24. You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth as water.

25. You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.

26. Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

27. And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD your God: and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh.

28. Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you for ever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.

29. When the LORD your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go to possess them, and you succeed them, and dwell in their land;

30. Take heed to yourself that you be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before you; and that you enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

31. You shall not do so unto the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.

32. Whatsoever I command you, observe to do it: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

## Deuteronomy 13

1. If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,

2. And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spoke unto you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;

3. You shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proves you, to know whether all of you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

4. All of you shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and all of you shall serve him, and cleave unto him.

5. And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he has spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put the evil away from the midst of you.

6. If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, which is as yours own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;

7. Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;

8. You shall not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall yours eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him:

9. But you shall surely kill him; yours hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

10. And you shall stone him with stones, that he die; because he has sought to thrust you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

11. And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.

12. If you shall hear say in one of your cities, which the LORD your God has given you to dwell there, saying,

13. Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which all of you have not known;

14. Then shall you enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;

15. You shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

16. And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof everything, for the LORD your God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

17. And there shall cleave nothing of the cursed thing to yours hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion upon you, and multiply you, as he has sworn unto your fathers;

18. When you shall hearken to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD your God.

## Deuteronomy 14

1. All of you are the children of the LORD your God: all of you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

2. For you are an holy people unto the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be an exclusive people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.

3. You shall not eat any abominable thing.

4. These are the beasts which all of you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,

5. The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

6. And every beast that parts the hoof, and cleaves the cleft into two claws, and chews the cud among the beasts, that all of you shall eat.

7. Nevertheless these all of you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

8. And the swine, because it divides the hoof, yet chews not the cud, it is unclean unto you: all of you shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.

9. These all of you shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall all of you eat:

10. And whatsoever has not fins and scales all of you may not eat; it is unclean unto you.

11. Of all clean birds all of you shall eat.

12. But these are they of which all of you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the buzzard,

13. And the vulture, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

14. And every raven after his kind,

15. And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,

16. The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

17. And the pelican, and the carrion vulture, and the cormorant,

18. And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

19. And every creeping thing that flies is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.

20. But of all clean fowls all of you may eat.

21. All of you shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it unto the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it unto an foreigner: for you are an holy people unto the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

22. You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year.

23. And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of yours oil, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.

24. And if the way be too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from you, which the LORD your God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD your God has blessed you:

25. Then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money in yours hand, and shall go unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose:

26. And you shall bestow that money for whatsoever your soul lusts after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever your soul desires: and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you, and yours household,

27. And the Levite that is within your gates; you shall not forsake him; for he has no part nor inheritance with you.

28. At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of yours increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:

29. And the Levite, (because he has no part nor inheritance with you,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of yours hand which you do.

## Deuteronomy 15

1. At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.

2. And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.

3. Of a foreigner you may exact it again: but that which is yours with your brother yours hand shall release;

4. Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it:

5. Only if you carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command you this day.

6. For the LORD your God blesses you, as he promised you: and you shall lend unto many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you.

7. If there be among you a poor man of one of your brethren within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden yours heart, nor shut yours hand from your poor brother:

8. But you shall open yours hand wide unto him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wants.

9. Beware that there be not a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and yours eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry unto the LORD against you, and it be sin unto you.

10. You shall surely give him, and yours heart shall not be grieved when you give unto him: because that for this thing the LORD your God shall bless you in all your works, and in all that you put yours hand unto.

11. For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall open yours hand wide unto your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land.

12. And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.

13. And when you send him out free from you, you shall not let him go away empty:

14. You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your floor, and out of your winepress: of that wherewith the LORD your God has blessed you you shall give unto him.

15. And you shall remember that you were a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing to day.

16. And it shall be, if he say unto you, I will not go away from you; because he loves you and yours house, because he is well with you;

17. Then you shall take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also unto your maidservant you shall do likewise.

18. It shall not seem hard unto you, when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant to you, in serving you six years: and the LORD your God shall bless you in all that you do.

19. All the first born males that come of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify unto the LORD your God: you shall do no work with the first born of your bullock, nor shear the first born of your sheep.

20. You shall eat it before the LORD your God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, you and your household.

21. And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, you shall not sacrifice it unto the LORD your God.

22. You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

23. Only you shall not eat the blood thereof; you shall pour it upon the ground as water.

## Deuteronomy 16

1. Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD your God: for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.

2. You shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.

3. You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.

4. And there shall be no leavened bread seen with you in all your coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which you sacrificed the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.

5. You may not sacrifice the passover within any of your gates, which the LORD your God gives you:

6. But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.

7. And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the LORD your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go unto your tents.

8. Six days you shall eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God: you shall do no work therein.

9. Seven weeks shall you number unto you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.

10. And you shall keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of yours hand, which you shall give unto the LORD your God, according as the LORD your God has blessed you:

11. And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.

12. And you shall remember that you were a bondman in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.

13. You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:

14. And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.

15. Seven days shall you keep a solemn feast unto the LORD your God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD your God shall bless you in all yours increase, and in all the works of yours hands, therefore you shall surely rejoice.

16. Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:

17. Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you.

18. Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.

19. You shall not shift judgment; you shall not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

20. That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live, and inherit the land which the LORD your God gives you.

21. You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.

22. Neither shall you set you up any image; which the LORD your God hates.

## Deuteronomy 17

1. You shall not sacrifice unto the LORD your God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evil thing: for that is an abomination unto the LORD your God.

2. If there be found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, man or woman, that has wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,

3. And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;

4. And it be told you, and you have heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

5. Then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto your gates, even that man or that woman, and shall stone them with stones, till they die.

6. At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.

7. The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall put the evil away from among you.

8. If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;

9. And you shall come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:

10. And you shall do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall show you; and you shall observe to do according to all that they inform you:

11. According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do: you shall not decline from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.

12. And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Israel.

13. And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.

14. When you are come unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are about me;

15. You shall in any way set him king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose: one from among your brethren shall you set king over you: you may not set a stranger over you, which is not your brother.

16. But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD has said unto you, All of you shall henceforth return no more that way.

17. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.

18. And it shall be, when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

19. And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:

20. That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 18

1. The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

2. Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he has said unto them.

3. And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

4. The first-fruit also of your corn, of your wine, and of yours oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.

5. For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.

6. And if a Levite come from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

7. Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.

8. They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which comes of the sale of his patrimony.

9. When you are come into the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

10. There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.

11. Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.

12. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you.

13. You shall be perfect with the LORD your God.

14. For these nations, which you shall possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for you, the LORD your God has not suffered you so to do.

15. The LORD your God will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of you, of your brethren, like unto me; unto him all of you shall hearken;

16. According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.

17. And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.

18. I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

19. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

20. But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

21. And if you say in yours heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?

22. When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him.

## Deuteronomy 19

1. When the LORD your God has cut off the nations, whose land the LORD your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;

2. You shall separate three cities for you in the midst of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.

3. You shall prepare you a way, and divide the coasts of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

4. And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso kills his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;

5. As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the wooden handle, and lights upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:

6. Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.

7. Wherefore I command you, saying, You shall separate three cities for you.

8. And if the LORD your God enlarge your coast, as he has sworn unto your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised to give unto your fathers;

9. If you shall keep all these commandments to do them, which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you, beside these three:

10. That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be upon you.

11. But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and strike him mortally that he die, and flees into one of these cities:

12. Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

13. Yours eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.

14. You shall not remove your neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in yours inheritance, which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it.

15. One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.

16. If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;

17. Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;

18. And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;

19. Then shall all of you do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shall you put the evil away from among you.

20. And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

21. And yours eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

## Deuteronomy 20

1. When you go out to battle against yours enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, be not afraid of them: for the LORD your God is with you, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

2. And it shall be, when all of you are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

3. And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, all of you approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be all of you terrified because of them;

4. For the LORD your God is he that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.

5. And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.

6. And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

7. And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.

8. And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.

9. And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.

10. When you come nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.

11. And it shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open unto you, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto you, and they shall serve you.

12. And if it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:

13. And when the LORD your God has delivered it into yours hands, you shall strike every male thereof with the edge of the sword:

14. But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shall you take unto yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of yours enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.

15. Thus shall you do unto all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.

16. But of the cities of these people, which the LORD your God does give you for an inheritance, you shall keep alive nothing that breathes:

17. But you shall utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD your God has commanded you:

18. That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should all of you sin against the LORD your God.

19. When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

20. Only the trees which you know that they be not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it be subdued.

## Deuteronomy 21

1. If one be found slain in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who has slain him:

2. Then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:

3. And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which has not been wrought with, and which has not drawn in the yoke;

4. And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

5. And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:

6. And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:

7. And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

8. Be merciful, O LORD, unto your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto your people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

9. So shall you put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.

10. When you go forth to war against yours enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into yours hands, and you have taken them captive,

11. And see among the captives a beautiful woman, and have a desire unto her, that you would have her to your wife;

12. Then you shall bring her home to yours house, and she shall shave her head, and trim her nails;

13. And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in yours house, and mourn for her father and her mother a full month: and after that you shall go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.

14. And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not make merchandise of her, because you have humbled her.

15. If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

16. Then it shall be, when he makes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:

17. But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

18. If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

19. Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;

20. And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.

21. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shall you put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.

22. And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:

23. His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall in any way bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 22

1. You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall in any case bring them again unto your brother.

2. And if your brother be not nigh unto you, or if you know him not, then you shall bring it unto yours own house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall restore it to him again.

3. In like manner shall you do with his ass; and so shall you do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found, shall you do likewise: you may not hide yourself.

4. You shall not see your brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.

5. The woman shall not wear that which pertains unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD your God.

6. If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, you shall not take the dam with the young:

7. But you shall in any way let the dam go, and take the young to you; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.

8. When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood upon yours house, if any man fall from thence.

9. You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.

10. You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.

11. You shall not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.

12. You shall make you fringes upon the four quarters of your vesture, wherewith you cover yourself.

13. If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

14. And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:

15. Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:

16. And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hates her;

17. And, lo, he has given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not your daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.

18. And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

19. And they shall fine him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

20. But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:

21. Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.

22. If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.

23. If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

24. Then all of you shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and all of you shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbour's wife: so you shall put away evil from among you.

25. But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.

26. But unto the damsel you shall do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbour, and slays him, even so is this matter:

27. For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.

28. If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

29. Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.

30. A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt.

## Deuteronomy 23

1. He that is wounded in the stones, or has his private parts cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

2. A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

3. An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

4. Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when all of you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.

5. Nevertheless the LORD your God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing unto you, because the LORD your God loved you.

6. You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days for ever.

7. You shall not detest an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not detest an Egyptian; because you were a stranger in his land.

8. The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

9. When the host goes forth against yours enemies, then keep you from every wicked thing.

10. If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chances him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

11. But it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

12. You shall have a place also without the camp, where you shall go forth abroad:

13. And you shall have a paddle upon your weapon; and it shall be, when you will ease yourself abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:

14. For the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up yours enemies before you; therefore shall your camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.

15. You shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto you:

16. He shall dwell with you, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of your gates, where it likes him best: you shall not oppress him.

17. There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.

18. You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD your God.

19. You shall not lend upon interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest:

20. Unto a stranger you may lend upon interest; but unto your brother you shall not lend upon interest: that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set yours hand to in the land where you go to possess it.

21. When you shall vow a vow unto the LORD your God, you shall not slack to pay it: for the LORD your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.

22. But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.

23. That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as you have vowed unto the LORD your God, which you have promised with your mouth.

24. When you come into your neighbour's vineyard, then you may eat grapes your fill at yours own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel.

25. When you come into the standing corn of your neighbour, then you may pluck the ears with yours hand; but you shall not move a sickle unto your neighbour's standing corn.

## Deuteronomy 24

1. When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

2. And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.

3. And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and gives it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;

4. Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.

5. When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he has taken.

6. No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he takes a man's life to pledge.

7. If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and makes merchandise of him, or sells him; then that thief shall die; and you shall put evil away from among you.

8. Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so all of you shall observe to do.

9. Remember what the LORD your God did unto Miriam by the way, after that all of you were come forth out of Egypt.

10. When you do lend your brother any thing, you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge.

11. You shall stand abroad, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto you.

12. And if the man be poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge:

13. In any case you shall deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness unto you before the LORD your God.

14. You shall not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of your brethren, or of your strangers that are in your land within your gates:

15. At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and sets his heart upon it: lest he cry against you unto the LORD, and it be sin unto you.

16. The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

17. You shall not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

18. But you shall remember that you were a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you thence: therefore I command you to do this thing.

19. When you cut down yours harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of yours hands.

20. When you beat yours olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.

21. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.

22. And you shall remember that you were a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.

## Deuteronomy 25

1. If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

2. And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

3. Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile unto you.

4. You shall not suppress the ox when he treads out the corn.

5. If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.

6. And it shall be, that the firstborn which she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.

7. And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.

8. Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

9. Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.

10. And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that has his shoe loosed.

11. When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draws near in order to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes him by the secrets:

12. Then you shall cut off her hand, yours eye shall not pity her.

13. You shall not have in your bag divers weights, a great and a small.

14. You shall not have in yours house divers measures, a great and a small.

15. But you shall have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shall you have: that your days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD your God gives you.

16. For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD your God.

17. Remember what Amalek did unto you by the way, when all of you were come forth out of Egypt;

18. How he met you by the way, and stroke the hindmost of you, even all that were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he feared not God.

19. Therefore it shall be, when the LORD your God has given you rest from all yours enemies round about, in the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; you shall not forget it.

## Deuteronomy 26

1. And it shall be, when you are come in unto the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein;

2. That you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which you shall bring of your land that the LORD your God gives you, and shall put it in a basket, and shall go unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name there.

3. And you shall go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD your God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD swore unto our fathers in order to give us.

4. And the priest shall take the basket out of yours hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD your God.

5. And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:

6. And the Egyptians evil pleaded us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:

7. And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:

8. And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:

9. And he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, even a land that flows with milk and honey.

10. And now, behold, I have brought the first-fruits of the land, which you, O LORD, have given me. And you shall set it before the LORD your God, and worship before the LORD your God:

11. And you shall rejoice in every good thing which the LORD your God has given unto you, and unto yours house, you, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

12. When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of yours increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;

13. Then you shall say before the LORD your God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

14. I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me.

15. Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the land which you have given us, as you sware unto our fathers, a land that flows with milk and honey.

16. This day the LORD your God has commanded you to do these statutes and judgments: you shall therefore keep and do them with all yours heart, and with all your soul.

17. You have stand as a witness to the LORD this day to be your God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:

18. And the LORD has stand as a witness to you this day to be his exclusive people, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments;

19. And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that you may be an holy people unto the LORD your God, as he has spoken.

## Deuteronomy 27

1. And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.

2. And it shall be on the day when all of you shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and smear them with plaster:

3. And you shall write upon them all the words of this law, when you are passed over, that you may go in unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land that flows with milk and honey; as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you.

4. Therefore it shall be when all of you be gone over Jordan, that all of you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall smear them with plaster.

5. And there shall you build an altar unto the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool upon them.

6. You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of whole stones: and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD your God:

7. And you shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before the LORD your God.

8. And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.

9. And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.

10. You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day.

11. And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

12. These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when all of you are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

13. And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

14. And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,

15. Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.

16. Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

17. Cursed be he that removes his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.

18. Cursed be he that makes the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.

19. Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

20. Cursed be he that lies with his father's wife; because he uncovers his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

21. Cursed be he that lies with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.

22. Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

23. Cursed be he that lies with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.

24. Cursed be he that strikes his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.

25. Cursed be he that takes reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.

26. Cursed be he that confirms not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

## Deuteronomy 28

1. And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that the LORD your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth:

2. And all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you, if you shall hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God.

3. Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.

4. Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your cattle, the increase of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep.

5. Blessed shall be your basket and your store.

6. Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.

7. The LORD shall cause yours enemies that rise up against you to be smitten before your face: they shall come out against you one way, and flee before you seven ways.

8. The LORD shall command the blessing upon you in your storehouses, and in all that you set yours hand unto; and he shall bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.

9. The LORD shall establish you an holy people unto himself, as he has sworn unto you, if you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in his ways.

10. And all people of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of you.

11. And the LORD shall make you abundant in goods, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give you.

12. The LORD shall open unto you his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto your land in his season, and to bless all the work of yours hand: and you shall lend unto many nations, and you shall not borrow.

13. And the LORD shall make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if that you hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do them:

14. And you shall not go aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

15. But it shall come to pass, if you will not hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day; that all these curses shall come upon you, and overtake you:

16. Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.

17. Cursed shall be your basket and your store.

18. Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your land, the increase of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep.

19. Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.

20. The LORD shall send upon you cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that you set yours hand unto in order to do, until you be destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the wickedness of your doings, whereby you have forsaken me.

21. The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto you, until he have consumed you from off the land, where you go to possess it.

22. The LORD shall strike you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.

23. And your heaven that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron.

24. The LORD shall make the rain of your land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon you, until you be destroyed.

25. The LORD shall cause you to be smitten before yours enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

26. And your carcass shall be food unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall frighten them away.

27. The LORD will strike you with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.

28. The LORD shall strike you with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:

29. And you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save you.

30. You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build an house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof.

31. Yours ox shall be slain before yours eyes, and you shall not eat thereof: yours ass shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given unto yours enemies, and you shall have none to rescue them.

32. Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people, and yours eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in yours hand.

33. The fruit of your land, and all your labours, shall a nation which you know not eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always:

34. So that you shall be mad for the sight of yours eyes which you shall see.

35. The LORD shall strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot unto the top of your head.

36. The LORD shall bring you, and your king which you shall set over you, unto a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known; and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.

37. And you shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations where the LORD shall lead you.

38. You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

39. You shall plant vineyards, and dress them, but shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.

40. You shall have olive trees throughout all your coasts, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for yours olive shall cast his fruit.

41. You shall brought forth sons and daughters, but you shall not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.

42. All your trees and fruit of your land shall the locust consume.

43. The stranger that is within you shall get up above you very high; and you shall come down very low.

44. He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.

45. Moreover all these curses shall come upon you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, till you be destroyed; because you hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you:

46. And they shall be upon you for a sign and for a wonder, and upon your seed for ever.

47. Because you served not the LORD your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

48. Therefore shall you serve yours enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in lack of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he have destroyed you.

49. The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;

50. A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favour to the young:

51. And he shall eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land, until you be destroyed: which also shall not leave you either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of your cattle, or flocks of your sheep, until he have destroyed you.

52. And he shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fenced walls come down, wherein you trusted, throughout all your land: and he shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you.

53. And you shall eat the fruit of yours own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the strictness, wherewith yours enemies shall distress you:

54. So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:

55. So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he has nothing left him in the siege, and in the strictness, wherewith yours enemies shall distress you in all your gates.

56. The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,

57. And toward her young one that comes out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for lack of all things secretly in the siege and strictness, wherewith yours enemy shall distress you in your gates.

58. If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD Your GOD;

59. Then the LORD will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

60. Moreover he will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave unto you.

61. Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon you, until you be destroyed.

62. And all of you shall be left few in number, whereas all of you were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.

63. And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nothing; and all of you shall be plucked from off the land where you go to possess it.

64. And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.

65. And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

66. And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear day and night, and shall have none assurance of your life:

67. In the morning you shall say, Would God it were even! and at even you shall say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of yours heart wherewith you shall fear, and for the sight of yours eyes which you shall see.

68. And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spoke unto you, You shall see it no more again: and there all of you shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

## Deuteronomy 29

1. These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

2. And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, All of you have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;

3. The great temptations which yours eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:

4. Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

5. And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not becoming old upon you, and your shoe is not becoming old upon your foot.

6. All of you have not eaten bread, neither have all of you drunk wine or strong drink: that all of you might know that I am the LORD your God.

7. And when all of you came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we stroke them:

8. And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.

9. Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that all of you may prosper in all that all of you do.

10. All of you stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,

11. Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood unto the drawer of your water:

12. That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:

13. That he may establish you to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto you a God, as he has said unto you, and as he has sworn unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

14. Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

15. But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:

16. (For all of you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which all of you passed by;

17. And all of you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

18. Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;

19. And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:

20. The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

21. And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:

22. So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid upon it;

23. And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:

24. Even all nations shall say, Wherefore has the LORD done thus unto this land? what means the heat of this great anger?

25. Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

26. For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

27. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

28. And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.

29. The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

## Deuteronomy 30

1. And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where the LORD your God has driven you,

2. And shall return unto the LORD your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all yours heart, and with all your soul;

3. That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion upon you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.

4. If any of yours be driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD your God gather you, and from thence will he fetch you:

5. And the LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers.

6. And the LORD your God will circumcise yours heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all yours heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.

7. And the LORD your God will put all these curses upon yours enemies, and on them that hate you, which persecuted you.

8. And you shall return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command you this day.

9. And the LORD your God will make you abundant in every work of yours hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers:

10. If you shall hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if you turn unto the LORD your God with all yours heart, and with all your soul.

11. For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.

12. It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

13. Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

14. But the word is very nigh unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.

15. See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil;

16. In that I command you this day to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that you may live and multiply: and the LORD your God shall bless you in the land where you go to possess it.

17. But if yours heart turn away, so that you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

18. I denounce unto you this day, that all of you shall surely perish, and that all of you shall not prolong your days upon the land, where you pass over Jordan to go to possess it.

19. I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:

20. That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may cleave unto him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

## Deuteronomy 31

1. And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel.

2. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said unto me, You shall not go over this Jordan.

3. The LORD your God, he will go over before you, and he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before you, as the LORD has said.

4. And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

5. And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that all of you may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.

6. Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.

7. And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people unto the land which the LORD has sworn unto their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.

8. And the LORD, he it is that does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: fear not, neither be dismayed.

9. And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

10. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

11. When all Israel has come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.

12. Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and your stranger that is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:

13. And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as all of you live in the land where all of you go over Jordan to possess it.

14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

15. And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

16. And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

17. Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?

18. And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.

19. Now therefore write all of you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

20. For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and becoming fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

21. And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.

22. Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.

23. And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them: and I will be with you.

24. And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

25. That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,

26. Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.

27. For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, all of you have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

28. Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.

29. For I know that after my death all of you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because all of you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

30. And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.

## Deuteronomy 32

1. Give ear, O all of you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.

2. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:

3. Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe all of you greatness unto our God.

4. He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.

5. They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

6. Do all of you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?

7. Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.

8. When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.

9. For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.

10. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.

11. As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutteres over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:

12. So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.

13. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

14. Butter of cattle, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.

15. But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are becoming fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

16. They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.

17. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

18. Of the Rock that brings forth you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.

19. And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

20. And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faith.

21. They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the low hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

23. I will heap evil upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.

24. They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

25. The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the nursing infant also with the man of gray hairs.

26. I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:

27. Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.

28. For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.

29. O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!

30. How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?

31. For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.

32. For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:

33. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

34. Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?

35. To me belongs vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

36. For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.

37. And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,

38. Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.

39. See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.

40. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

41. If I sharpen my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.

42. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

43. Rejoice, O all of you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

44. And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

45. And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

46. And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which all of you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

47. For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing all of you shall prolong your days in the land, where all of you go over Jordan to possess it.

48. And the LORD spoke unto Moses that very same day, saying,

49. Get you up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is opposite to Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:

50. And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered unto your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:

51. Because all of you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because all of you sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

52. Yet you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 33

1. And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.

2. And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.

3. Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in your hand: and they sat down at your feet; every one shall receive of your words.

4. Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.

5. And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

6. Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

7. And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be you an help to him from his enemies.

8. And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;

9. Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed your word, and kept your covenant.

10. They shall teach Jacob your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice upon yours altar.

11. Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; strike through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.

12. And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

13. And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that couches beneath,

14. And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,

15. And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,

16. And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.

17. His glory is like the first born of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

18. And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.

19. They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

20. And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlarges Gad: he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm with the crown of the head.

21. And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.

22. And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's offspring: he shall leap from Bashan.

23. And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess you the west and the south.

24. And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

25. Your shoes shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be.

26. There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rides upon the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.

27. The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.

28. Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.

29. Happy are you, O Israel: who is like unto you, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellency! and yours enemies shall be found liars unto you; and you shall tread upon their high places.

## Deuteronomy 34

1. And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite to Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

2. And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

3. And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

4. And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto your seed: I have caused you to see it with yours eyes, but you shall not go over thither.

5. So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

6. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite to Bethpeor: but no man knows of his tomb unto this day.

7. And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force decreased.

8. And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

9. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.

10. And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,

11. In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,

12. And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.
