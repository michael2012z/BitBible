## 2 Chronicles 1

1.  Solomon Reigns in Jerusalem And [4grew in strength 1Solomon 2son 3of David] over  his kingdom, and the lord  his God was with him, and magnified him in stature.

2. And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands, and to the commanders of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the rulers before all Israel, to the rulers of the families.

3. And Solomon went out and all the assembly with him unto the high place  in Gibeon, of which [6was located 1the 2tent 3of the 4testimony  5of God], which [4made 1Moses 2the servant 3of the lord] in the wilderness.

4. [3the 1But 4ark  5of God 2David brought] from out of the city of Kirjath Jearim, for [2prepared 3for it 1David]; for he pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.

5. And the altar  of brass which [6made 1Bezaleel 2son 3of Uri 4son 5of Hur] was there before the tent of the lord. And [5sought by 6it 1Solomon 2and 3the 4assembly].

6. And Solomon offered there upon the altar, the one of brass, the one before the lord, the one in the tent of the testimony. And he offered upon it [2whole burnt-offerings 1a thousand].

7. In  that night God appeared to Solomon, and he said to him, Ask what I shall give to you!

8. And Solomon said to  God, You performed with David  my father [2act of kindness 1a great], and gave me reign instead of him.

9. And now, O lord  God, let [2be trustworthy  1your word] with David  my father! For you gave me reign over a people vast as the dust of the earth.

10. Now [3wisdom 4and 5understanding 1give 2to me]! and I shall go forth before  this people and enter in. For who shall judge  [4people 2your  3great 1this]?

11. And God said to Solomon, Because this happened in  your heart, and you did not ask wealth of things, nor glory, nor the life of the ones detesting you, and you did not ask for [2days 1many]; but you asked for yourself wisdom and understanding, so as to judge  my people, over whom I gave you to reign over it --

12. the wisdom and the understanding I give to you; and wealth, and possessions, and glory I shall give to you, as did not happen likened unto you among the kings  before you, and [3after 4you 1it will not be 2thus].

13. And Solomon came from Bama, of the one in Gibeon, unto Jerusalem, from the face of the tent of the testimony; and he reigned over Israel.

14. And Solomon brought together chariots and horsemen; and there were to him a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he left them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.

15. And [3established 1the 2king]  silver and  gold in Jerusalem as the stones; and the cedars in  Judea as sycamine trees, the ones in the plains in multitude.

16. And there was an exodus of the horses to Solomon from Egypt, and [2by the 3value 4of the 5merchants 6of the 7king  8to go forth 1they were bought].

17. And they ascended and brought from out of Egypt [2chariot 1one] for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for fifty and a hundred. And thus to all the kings of the Hittites, and to the kings  of Syria, [2by 3their hands 1they brought them forth].  

## 2 Chronicles 2

1.  Solomon Prepares the House of The LORD And Solomon spoke  to build the house to the name of the lord, and a house  for his kingdom.

2. And Solomon brought together seventy thousand men load carriers, and eighty thousand men quarrying in the mountain. And the supervisors over them -- three thousand and six hundred.

3. And Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying, As you did with David  my father, and sent to him cedars  to build for himself a house  to dwell in it,

4. then behold, I  his son am building a house to the name of the lord  my God, to sanctify it to him,  to burn before him incense of aromatics, and for a place setting to be continually before him, and  to offer whole burnt-offerings continually in the morning and the evening, and on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the holidays of the lord  our God. Into the eon this is for  Israel.

5. And the house which I build is to be great, for great is the lord  our God beyond all the gods.

6. And who is strong to build to him a house? For the heaven and the heaven of the heaven does not bear him. And who am I building to him a house, except  to burn incense in front of him?

7. And now, send to me [2man 1a wise], and one knowing  how to prepare in  gold, and in  silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in  purple, and in  scarlet, and in  blue, and having knowledge to carve carved works with the wise ones, of the ones with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, which [3prepared 1David  2my father]!

8. And send to me timbers of cedars, and of junipers, and of pines, from out of  Lebanon! for I know that  your servants know how to fell timbers from  Lebanon. And behold,  my servants shall go with  your servants,

9. to prepare for me timbers in multitude, for the house which I build is great and glorious.

10. And behold, to the ones working in the felling timbers, [3for 4foods 1I have given 2grain] as gifts to your servants of cors of wheat -- twenty thousand, and barley cors -- twenty thousand, and wine measures -- twenty thousand, and olive oil measures -- twenty thousand.

11. And [4spoke 1Hiram 2king 3of Tyre] by writing, and sent to Solomon, saying, In the lord loving  his people, he put you over them for king.

12. And Hiram said, Blessed be the lord  God of Israel, who made the heaven and the earth, who gave to [2David  1king 4son 3a wise], and knowing understanding and higher knowledge, who shall build a house to the lord, and a house  for his kingdom.

13. And now, I have sent to you a man wise and knowing understanding --  Hiram  my servant,

14. a son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and  his father is a Tyrian man, knowing how to prepare in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in stones, and woods, and to weave in  purple, and in  blue, and in  linen, and in  scarlet, and to carve carvings, and to consider every device in which ever you should give to him with  your wise men, and the wise ones  of my master David  your father.

15. And now the grain, and the barley, and the olive oil, and the wine, which [2spoke  1my master], let him send it to his servants!

16. And we will fell trees from out of  Lebanon, according to all  your need. And we will bring them by barge upon the sea to Joppa; and you shall bring them up unto Jerusalem.

17. And Solomon gathered all the men of the foreigners of the ones in the land of Israel, after the count which [3counted 4them 1David  2his father]. And were found a hundred fifty thousand and three thousand six hundred.

18. And he made of them seventy thousand load carriers, and eighty thousand quarriers in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred foremen over the people.  

## 2 Chronicles 3

1.  The LORD's House on Mount Moriah And Solomon began  to build the house of the lord in Jerusalem on mount  Moriah, of which the lord appeared  to David  his father, in the place which David prepared on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

2. And he began to build in the [2month  1second], in the [2year  1fourth]  of his kingdom.

3. And these Solomon began  to build: the house  of God -- the length of the [2measurement  1first] [2cubits 1was sixty], and the breadth [2cubits 1twenty].

4. And the columned porch before the face of the house -- its length upon the face of the width of the house [2cubits 1was twenty], and the height [4cubits 1was a hundred 2and 3twenty]. And he gilded it inside [2gold 1in pure].

5. And the [2house  1great] he boarded with woods of cedars, and he gilded it [2gold 1in pure]. And he carved upon it palms and chainwork.

6. And he adorned the house [2stones 1with valuable] for glory; and the gold was gold  from Parvaim.

7. And he gilded the house, and  its walls, and the gatehouses, and the roofing, and the doorways with gold; and he carved cherubim upon the walls.

8. And he made the house of the holy of the holies. Its length upon the face of the width of the house [2cubits 1was twenty], and the breadth [2cubits 1was twenty]. And he gilded it [2gold 1in pure] amounting to [2talents 1six hundred].

9. And the scale-weight of the nails -- the scale-weight of the one was fifty shekels  of gold. And the upper room he gilded in gold.

10. And he made in the house, in the holy of the holies, [2cherubim 1two], a work of [2wood 1incorruptible], and he gilded them in gold.

11. And the wings of the cherubim -- the length [2cubits 1was twenty], and to the [2wing  1one 4cubits 3was five] touching the wall of the house.

12. And the [2wing  1other 4cubits 3was five], touching the wing of the [2cherub  1other].

13. And the wings  of these cherubim being open and spread out [2cubits 1was twenty]. And these stood upon  their feet, and  their faces were towards the house.

14. And he made the veil out of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and of linen. And he wove [2in 3it 1cherubim].

15. And he made in front of the house [2columns 1two] -- [2cubits 1thirty-five]  in height, and  their capitals [2cubits 1were five].

16. And he made chain-work in the dabir, and he put them upon the tops of the columns. And he made [2figures of pomegranates 1a hundred], and put them upon the chainwork.

17. And he set the columns at the front of the temple, one at the right and  one at the left. And he called the name of the one at the right -- Success, and the name of the one at the left -- Strength.  

## 2 Chronicles 4

1.  The Items for the Temple And he made an altar of brass -- twenty cubits was the length, and twenty cubits the breadth, and ten cubits the height.

2. And he made the [2sea 1cast] -- ten cubits the diameter, from  its lip to  its lip, globular round about, and five cubits was the height. And the circumference -- thirty cubits encircled it round about.

3. And a representation of calves was underneath it, round about encircling it; ten in a cubit encircling the sea round about; with two rows of [2oxen 1cast] in  their being cast in a furnace,

4. in which they made them. And standing upon twelve calves was the sea. The three were looking north, and  three were looking west, and  three were looking south, and  three were looking towards the east. And the sea was upon them upward. And [3were  2posteriors 1their] towards the inside.

5. And  its thickness was a palm, and  its lip was as a lip of a cup, having been carved of buds of a lily, having a capacity [2measures 1of three thousand]. And he completed it.

6. And he made [2bathing tubs 1ten], and put  five on the right, and  five on the left,  to wash in them the works of the whole burnt-offerings, and to rinse off in them. But the sea was for the washing of the priests in it.

7. And he made the lamp-stands  of gold -- ten, according to  their distinguishing manner. And he put in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.

8. And he made [2tables 1ten], and he put them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. And he made [2bowls 3of gold 1a hundred].

9. And he made the courtyard of the priests, and the [2courtyard  1great], and doors for the courtyard; and their doorways were being brazed in brass.

10. And the sea he put at the corner of the house at the right towards the east of the part  towards the south.

11. And Hiram made the kettles, and the meat hooks, and the censers. And Hiram completed doing all the work which he did for Solomon the king in the house  of God --

12. making [2columns 1two], and the pommels, and the capitals upon the tops of the [2columns 1two], and [2latticed works 1two] to cover up the two pommels of the capitals, which are upon the tops of the columns;

13. and pomegranates of gold -- four hundred for the two latticed works; two kinds of pomegranates on the [2latticed work  1one],  to cover the two bases of the capitals, which are upon the columns.

14. And [2the 3bases 1he made] -- ten; and the bathing tubs he made upon the bases,

15. and the [2sea 1one], and the [2calves  1twelve] underneath it,

16. and the kettles, and the meat hooks and bowls. And all  their items which Hiram made,  he brought  to king Solomon in the house of the lord -- [2brass 1all of pure].

17. In the place round about the Jordan [3cast them 1the 2king] in the thick  earth, between Succoth and between Zeredathah.

18. And Solomon made all  these items in multitude, exceedingly; for [4was not 5wanting 1the scale-weight 2of the 3brass].

19. And Solomon made all the items of the house of the lord, and the altar  of gold, and the tables, and upon them bread loaves of the place setting.

20. And the lamp-stands, and the lamps for the light according to the distinguishing manner in front of the dabir, [2gold 1of pure].

21. And  their lamps, and  their tongs, and the bowls, and the incense pans, and the censers [2gold 1were of pure].

22. And the [2door 3of the 4house  1inner], which is in the holies of the holies, and the doors of the house of the temple, were in gold.  

## 2 Chronicles 5

1.  The Completion of the House of The LORD And [4was completed 1all 2the 3work] which Solomon did in the house of the lord; and Solomon carried in the holy things of David  his father, and the silver, and the gold, and all the items; and he put them in a treasury house of the lord.

2. Then Solomon held an assembly of all the elders of Israel, and all the rulers of the tribes, rulers of the families of the sons of Israel in Jerusalem,  to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord from out of the city of David -- this is Zion.

3. And [4was assembled 5unto 6the 7king 1every 2man 3of Israel] in the holiday -- this the [2month  1seventh].

4. And [5came 1all 2the 3elders 4of Israel], and [4took 1all 2the 3Levites] the ark.

5. And they brought the ark, and the tent of the testimony, and all the [2items  1holy], the ones in the tent; and [6brought 7it 1the 2priests 3and 4the 5Levites].

6. And  king Solomon, and all the gathering of Israel, and the ones being assembled unto him before the ark were sacrificing calves and sheep, which shall not be counted nor considered because of the multitude.

7. And [3carried in 1the 2priests] the ark of the covenant of the lord into  its place, into the dabir of the house, into the holies of the holies, underneath the wings of the cherubim.

8. And [3were 1the 2cherubim] being opened and spread out  of their wings over the place of the ark. And [3covered 1the 2cherubim] the ark, and over  its bearing poles on top.

9. And [3projected 1the 2bearing poles], and [5were seen 1the 2tips 3of the 4bearing poles] from the ark of the holies in front of the dabir, and they were not seen outside. And they were there until  this day.

10. Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses stationed at Horeb, which the lord ordained with the sons of Israel in  their coming forth from out of the land of Egypt. 

11.  The Glory of The LORD Fills the House And it came to pass in the coming forth of the priests from out of the holy places, (for all the priests  being found were sanctified, for they were not then set in order according to daily rotation)

12. and the Levites, the psalm singers, all with the sons of Asaph,  of Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brethren of the ones putting on apparels of fine linen, with cymbals, and with stringed instruments, and with lutes, were standing over against the altar, and with them  [4priests 1a hundred 2and 3twenty] trumpeting with the trumpets.

13. And there was one sound in the trumpeting, and in the singing along with stringed instruments, and in the sounding out loud [2voice 1with one]  to praise and to make acknowledgement to the lord. And as they raised up high the voice with the trumpets, and with cymbals, and with instruments for the odes, that they said, Make acknowledgment to the lord for he is good, for into the eon  is his mercy! And the house was filled up of the cloud and of the glory of the lord.

14. And [3were not able 1the 2priests]  to stand to officiate before the face of the cloud, for [3filled up 1the glory 2of the lord] the house  of God.  

## 2 Chronicles 6

1.  Solomon Blesses The LORD Then Solomon said, The lord spoke  to encamp in dimness.

2. And I have built a house to your name holy to you, and prepared  to encamp into the eons.

3. And [3turned 1the 2king]  his face, and he blessed all the assembly of Israel. And all the assembly of Israel stood by.

4. And he said, Blessed be the lord  God of Israel, who spoke by his mouth to David  my father, and by his hands he fulfilled, saying,

5. From the day which I led  my people from out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose  a city from all the tribes of Israel  to build a house  [2to be  1for my name] there, and I did not choose a man  to be for leader over  my people Israel.

6. And I chose  Jerusalem  [2to be  1for my name] there, and I chose  David  to be above  my people Israel.

7. And it came upon the heart of David  my father  to build a house to the name of the lord  God of Israel.

8. And the lord said to David  my father, Because it was upon your heart  to build a house to my name, [2well 1you do], for it was upon your heart.

9. Except you shall not build to me a house, for  your son who comes forth from out of  your loin, he shall build the house to my name.

10. And the lord established the word which he spoke. And I became instead of David  my father, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, as the lord said, and I built the house to the name of the lord  God of Israel.

11. And I put there the ark, in which [4is located 1the 2covenant 3of the lord], which he ordained  with Israel.

12. And he stood before the altar of the lord, before all the assembly of Israel, and he opened and spread out  his hands.

13. For Solomon made [2platform 1a brass], and he put it in the midst of the courtyard of the temple -- five cubits  was its length, and five cubits  was its breadth, and three cubits  was its height. And he stood upon it, and he bent upon  his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and he opened and spread out  his hands into the heaven.

14. And he said, O lord  God  of Israel, there is no [2likened 3to you 1God] in heaven, nor upon the earth, keeping the covenant, and  showing mercy to your children, to the ones going before you with all their heart,

15. which you kept with your servant David  my father, which you spoke to him; and you spoke by your mouth, and by your hands you fulfilled it, as  this day.

16. And now, O lord the God of Israel, keep with your servant David,  my father, what you spoke to him, saying, There shall not fail to you a man from before my face sitting upon the throne of Israel, if only [2should guard  1your sons]  their way  to go by  my law, as you went before me.

17. And now, O lord  God of Israel, let be trustworthy indeed  your saying, which you spoke to your manservant David.

18. For shall [2truly 3dwells 1God] with men upon the earth? If the heaven and the heaven of the heaven is not sufficient to you; then what  is this house which I built?

19. And should you look upon the prayer  of your manservant, and upon  his supplication, O lord  my God,  to heed the supplication and the prayer, which  your manservant prayed before you today;

20.  [2to be  1for your eyes] open unto  this house day and night, in  this place which you said to call upon  your name there;  to hear the prayer which [2prayed  1your manservant] in  this place.

21. Then shall you hear the supplication  of your manservant, and  of your people Israel, in what ever they should pray to  this place. And you shall hear from the place  of your dwelling -- from the heaven; and you shall hear and shall be propitious.

22. If [2should sin 1a man] against his neighbor, and he takes upon him an oath  to cause him to make an oath, and he should come and make an oath against the altar in  this house;

23. then you shall listen from out of the heaven, and shall act, and shall judge  your servants,  to recompense to the lawless one, and to recompense his ways upon his head; and  to do justice to the just,  to recompense to him according to  his righteousness.

24. And if [3should be devastated  1your people 2Israel] before an enemy, if they should sin against you, and should turn, and should acknowledge  your name, and should pray, and should beseech before you in  this house;

25. then you shall listen from the heaven, and you should be propitious to the sins  of your people Israel, and shall return them into the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.

26. And in the holding together the heaven, and there is no rain, because they sinned against you, and they pray to  this place, and confess to your name, and from  their sins they shall turn, because you shall humble them;

27. then you shall listen from  heaven, and shall be propitious to the sins  of your servants, and  your people Israel, that you shall make manifest to them the [2way  1good], in which they shall go by it. And you shall put rain upon  your land, which you gave to your people for an inheritance.

28. If famine happens upon the land, if plague happens -- wind-blown blight, jaundice; [3locust 4and 5grasshopper 1if 2there should be]; and if [2should afflict 3it  1its enemies] in the land against  its cities, according to every calamity and every misery;

29. then every prayer, and all supplication, whichever should be by any man, and all  your people Israel, if [2should know 1a man] his infection and  his infirmity, and should open and spread out  his hands to  this house;

30. then you shall listen from the heaven, from [2prepared 3home 1your], and you shall atone, and shall give to a man according to  his ways, as you should know  his heart; (for you most only know the heart of the sons of men.)

31. So that they should fear you,  to go in all  your ways, all the days which they should live upon the face of the land, of which you gave to our fathers.

32. And also every alien who is not of  your people Israel, and he should come from out of a land far off because of  [3name 1your  2great], and  [3hand 1your  2fortified], and  [3arm 1your  2high]; and should come and should pray in  this place;

33. then you shall listen from out of the heaven, from [2prepared 3home 1your], and you shall do according to all as much as [3should 4have called upon 5you 1the 2alien]; so that [6should know 1all 2the 3peoples 4of the 5earth]  your name, and  to fear you, as  your people Israel, and  to know that  your name is called upon  in this house which I built.

34. And if [2should go forth  1your people] for war against  its enemies, in the way which you shall send them, and they should pray to you towards the way  of this city which you chose, towards it and the house which I built to your name;

35. then you shall hear [4from out of 5the 6heaven  1their prayer 2and  3their supplication], and shall do  them justice.

36. For they shall sin against you, (for there is not a man who shall not sin,) and if enraged over them, and you should deliver them before the face of the enemies, and [3shall take them captive 1the 2ones capturing] into a land far or near;

37. and they should turn their heart in the land of which they were taken captive there, and they shall turn and should beseech you in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned, we acted lawlessly, and we acted impiously;

38. and they should turn towards you with all their heart, and with all their soul in the land of their being taken captive, of which they took them captive there, and they should pray in the way of their land, of which you gave to their fathers, and of the city of which you chose, and the house of which I built to your name;

39. then you shall hear from the heaven, from [2prepared 3home 1your],  of their prayer and  their supplication, and you shall make  their case, and you shall be propitious to the people  sinning against you.

40. And now, O lord  God, let [3be 1indeed  2your eyes] open, and  your ears attentive to the supplication  of this place!

41. And now, rise up O lord  God in  your rest, you and the ark  of your strength!  Your priests, O lord  God, shall clothe themselves in deliverance, and  your sacred ones shall be glad in good things.

42. O lord  God, you should not turn the face  of your anointed one. Remember the mercies of David  your servant!  

## 2 Chronicles 7

1.  Fire from Heaven And as Solomon completed praying, and  fire came down from out of the heaven, and it devoured the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices; and the glory of the lord filled the house.

2. And [3were not able 1the 2priests] to enter into the house of the lord at  that time, for [3filled 1the glory 2of the lord] the house of the lord.

3. And all the sons of Israel seeing [3come down 1the 2fire], and the glory of the lord upon the house, and they fell upon their face upon the ground, upon the stone pavement, and they did obeisance and gave praise to the lord, saying, For he is good, for [2is into 3the 4eon  1his mercy].

4. And the king and all the people were sacrificing the things offered for sacrifices before the lord. 

5.  Dedication of the Temple And [3sacrificed  1king 2Solomon] the sacrifice of calves -- twenty and two thousand, and pastured sheep -- a hundred and twenty thousand. And [7dedicated 8the 9house  10of God 1the 2king 3and 4all 5the 6people].

6. And the priests [2at  3their watches 1were standing], and the Levites with instruments of odes of the lord, which [4made 1David 2the 3king],  to acknowledge before the lord, that [2is into 3the 4eon  1his mercy], along with the hymns of David by their hand. And the priests were trumpeting trumpets opposite them, and all Israel was standing.

7. And Solomon sanctified the middle of the courtyard, of the one in the house of the lord; for he offered there the whole burnt-offerings, and the fat of the deliverance offerings; for the altar  of brass which Solomon made did not suffice to take the whole burnt-offerings, and the gift offerings, and the fat.

8. And Solomon observed the holiday at  that time for seven days, and all Israel with him; [3assembly 2great 1an exceedingly], from the entrance of Hamath, and unto the rushing stream of Egypt.

9. And he made on the [2day  1eighth] a holiday recess; for dedication of the altar he observed seven days, and the holiday seven days.

10. And on the [4day  1third 2and 3twentieth] of the [2month  1seventh] he sent the people to  their tents being glad and with a good heart over the good things which the lord did  to David, and  to Solomon, and to Israel  his people.

11. And Solomon completed the house of the lord, and the house of the king. And all as much as Solomon wanted in  his soul to do with the house of the lord, and in  his house, he was prospered.

12. And the lord appeared to Solomon in the night, and said to him, I heard  your prayer, and I chose in  this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.

13. If I should hold up the heaven, and [2does not 3happen 1rain], and if [3should be given charge 1the 2locust]  to eat up the land, and if I send a plague among  my people,

14. and they should have shame  (my people upon whom call upon  my name) upon them, and should pray, and should seek  my face, and should turn from  [3ways 1their  2wicked], then I shall listen from the heaven, and [2propitious 1I will be] to their sins, and I will heal  their land.

15. And now,  my eyes will be open, and  my ears attentive to the prayer  of this people.

16. And now, I chose and I have sanctified  this house,  [2to be 1for my name] there unto the eon. And [4will be  1my eyes 2and  3my heart] there all the days.

17. And if you should go before me as [3went 1David  2your father], and should do according to all what I gave charge to you, and  [2my orders 3and  4my judgments 1keep];

18. then I will raise up the throne  of your kingdom as I ordained to David  your father, saying, There shall not be removed to you a man ruling in Israel. 

19.  Warnings of Judgment But if you should turn, and should abandon  my orders, and  my commandments, which I put before you, and you should go and should serve other gods, and should do obeisance to them,

20. then I will remove you from the land of which I gave to you; and  this house which I sanctified to my name I will disown it from my face, and I will appoint it for a parable, and for a tale among all the nations.

21. And  this house, which was exalted -- everyone  traveling by it shall be amazed, and shall say, For why did the lord do thus to this land, and to this house?

22. And they shall say, Because they abandoned the lord, the God  of their fathers, the one leading them from out of the land of Egypt; and they took hold of other gods, and they did obeisance to them, and they served to them. On account of this he brought upon them all  this evil.  

## 2 Chronicles 8

1.  Solomon Strengthens the Cities of Israel And it came to pass after twenty years, in which Solomon built the house of the lord, and  his house,

2. and the cities which Hiram gave  to Solomon, [2built 3them up 1Solomon], and settled there the sons of Israel.

3. And Solomon came into Hamath Zobah, and prevailed over it.

4. And he built  Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the [2cities  1fortified] which he built in Hamath.

5. And he built  [2Beth-horon  1upper], and  [2Beth-horon  1lower], [2cities 1fortified] with walls, gates, and bars;

6. and  Baalath, and all the [2cities  1fortified] which were unto Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and as much as Solomon desired according to the desire  to build in Jerusalem, and in  Lebanon, and in all the land  of his authority.

7. All the people  left behind from the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are not of  Israel,

8. but were of  their sons  being left behind after them in the land of which [4did not 5utterly destroy 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and [2led 3them 1Solomon] into tribute until  this day.

9. And [4any of 5the 6sons 7of Israel 2did not 3appoint 1Solomon] as servants for all  his works in  his kingdom, for they were men warriors, and rulers, and mighty men, and rulers of his chariots, and of his horsemen.

10. And these rulers of the superintendents of king Solomon were fifty and two hundred directing works among the people.

11. And [2the 3daughter 4of Pharaoh 1Solomon led] from the city of David into the house which he built for her. For he said, [2shall not 3dwell  1My wife] in the city of David the king of Israel, for it is holy, because [5entered 6there 1the 2ark 3of the 4 lord].

12. Then Solomon offered whole burnt-offerings to the lord upon the altar of the lord, which he built before the temple,

13. according to the reckoning, day by day,  to offer according to the commandments of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and at the months, and in the holidays, three times during the year -- in the holiday of the unleavened breads, and in the holiday of the period of sevens, and in the holiday of the tents.

14. And he established, according to the ordinance of David  his father, the divisions of the priests according to  their ministrations, and of the Levites over  their watches,  to praise and to officiate before the priests, according to the reckoning -- day by  day; and of the gatekeepers in  their divisions -- for gate by gate; for thus was the commandment of David the man  of God.

15. They did not go by without heeding the commandments of the king, concerning the priests and the Levites, in any matter, and in the treasures.

16. And [5was prepared 1all 2the 3work 4of Solomon] from which day [3foundation was laid 1the 2house] of the lord, and until of which time it was finished, until of which time Solomon finished the house of the lord.

17. Then Solomon set out unto Ezion-geber, and unto  Eloth, the one by the sea in the land of Edom.

18. And Hiram sent by the hand of his servants boats, and servants knowing the sea. And they set out with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and they took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and they brought them to  king Solomon.  

## 2 Chronicles 9

1.  The Queen of Sheba Tests Solomon And the queen of Sheba heard the name Solomon, and she came  to test him with enigmas, unto Jerusalem, with [3force 2heavy 1an exceedingly], and camels carrying aromatics, and gold in multitude, and [2stone 1valuable]. And she came to Solomon, and she spoke to him all as much as was in  her soul.

2. And [2announced 3to her 1Solomon] all  her words, and not [2went by 1a word] from Solomon which he did not report to her.

3. And [3beheld 1the queen 2of Sheba] the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,

4. and the foods of his tables, and the form of his servants, and the station of his ministers, and  their garments, and  his wine servers, and  their uniform, and the whole burnt-offerings which he offered in the house of the lord; and there was no [2in 3her 4any longer 1breath].

5. And she said to the king, [3is true 1The 2word] which I heard in  my land concerning  your words, and concerning  your wisdom.

6. And I did not trust in the words until of which time I came and beheld with my eyes. And behold, [3was not reported 4to me 1the 2half] of the magnitude  of your wisdom being added over the hearing which I heard.

7. Blessed are  your men, blessed are  [2your servants 1these], the ones standing beside you always, and hearing  your wisdom.

8. May [3be 1the lord  2your God] for a blessing, who wanted by you  to put you upon his throne for a king to your God; in that [3loved 1the lord  2your God]  Israel,  to establish it into the eon, and he put you over them as king,  to execute equity and righteousness.

9. And she gave to the king a hundred twenty talents of gold, and aromatics in [2multitude 1very great], and [2stone 1valuable]. And there was not any according to  those aromatics which [3gave 1the queen 2of Sheba] to king Solomon.

10. And the servants of Hiram, and the servants of Solomon brought gold  to Solomon from out of Ophir, and wood of pines, and [2stone 1valuable].

11. And [3made 1the 2king] [2from the 3wood  4of pines 1ascents] for the house of the lord, and for the house of the king, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers. And there was not seen such as these before in the land of Judah.

12. And  king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all  her wants, which she asked for, outside of all what she brought  to king Solomon. And she returned unto  her land.

13. And was the weight of the gold  being brought  to Solomon in [2year 1one] -- six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,

14. besides [2the 3men  4arranging 5and  6trading 1what] brought. And all the kings  of Arabia, and the satraps of the land brought gold and silver  to king Solomon.

15. And [3made  1king 2Solomon] two hundred shields [2gold 1hammered out], with six hundred weights [2gold 1of pure] being used upon  [3shield 1the 2one].

16. And three hundred shields of hammered out gold of three hundred weights of gold bore upon  [2shield 1each]. And [3put 4them 1the 2king] in the house of the forest  of Lebanon.

17. And [3made 1the 2king 6throne 5ivory 7of tusks 4a great], and he gilded it [2gold 1in unadulterated].

18. And there were six stairs to the throne being bonded with gold, and [2a footstool 1he placed 5under 3in 4gold] the throne, and armrest angles on this side and on that side upon [3of the 4throne 1the 2chair], and two lions standing by the armrest angles.

19. And twelve lions standing there upon the six stairs on this side and on that side; there was not such in any kingdom.

20. And all the items  of king Solomon were gold, and all the items of the house of the forest  of Lebanon [2with gold 1were overtaken]. [2was not 1Silver] considered [3in 4the days 5of Solomon 1as 2anything].

21. For ships belonging to the king went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once in three years [2came 1boats] from Tarshish to the king being full of gold, and silver, and tusks of ivory, and apes. 

22.  Solomon Is Magnified And Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth, even in riches and wisdom.

23. And all the kings of the earth sought the face of Solomon to hear  his wisdom, of which God put in his heart.

24. And they brought, each one  his gifts -- items made of silver, and items of gold, and clothes, weapons, balsam, and spices, horses, and mules,  accordingly year by year.

25. And there were  to Solomon four thousand female horses for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he stationed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.

26. And he was leader of all the kings from the river and unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt.

27. And [3made 1the 2king]  silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made the cedars as the sycamine trees, the ones in the plain in multitude.

28. And the delivery of the horses from out of Egypt  to Solomon even was from all the lands.

29. And the rest of the words of Solomon, the first and the last, behold are not these written by the words of Nathan the prophet, and by the words of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

30. And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

31. And Solomon slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him in the city of David  his father. And [3reigned 1Rehoboam 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Chronicles 10

1.  Rehoboam Reigns in Judah And Rehoboam came unto Shechem, for unto Shechem came all Israel to give reign to him.

2. And it came to pass when [4heard 1Jeroboam 2son 3of Nebat], (for he was in Egypt, as he fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,) that Jeroboam returned from out of Egypt.

3. And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam came, and all the assembly of Israel, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,

4.  Your father hardened  our yoke; and now, you lighten from the [2servitude  3of your father  1hard], and from  [3yoke 1his  2heavy] which he put upon us! and we will serve to you.

5. And he said to them, Go until three days, and then come to me! And [3went forth 1the 2people].

6. And [3brought together  1king 2Rehoboam] the elders of the ones standing before Solomon  his father during  his life, saying, How do you counsel  to answer  [2to this people 1a word]?

7. And they spoke to him, saying, If in  today you should be for good to this people, and you should please them, and should speak to them [2words 1good], then they will be to you for servants all the days. 

8.  Rehoboam Forsakes the Counsel of the Elders And he forsook the counsel of the elders, the ones advising to him, and he was advised by the young men of the ones being brought up with him, of the ones standing before him.

9. And he said to them, What [2do you 3counsel 4that 5I shall answer 1word] to this people who spoke to me, saying, Spare us from the yoke of which [2put  1your father] upon us?

10. And [6said 7to him 1the 2young men  3having been brought up 4with 5him], saying, Thus shall you speak to the people, to the one speaking to you, saying,  Your father oppressed  our yoke, and you now lighten from  our yoke! Thus you shall say to them, [2small 3finger 1My] is thicker than the loin  of my father.

11. And now  my father inserted to you [2yoke 1a heavy], but I will add upon  your yoke.  My father corrected you with whips, but I will correct you with scorpions.

12. And Jeroboam came and all the people to Rehoboam on the [2day  1third], as [3said 1the 2king], saying, Return to me on the [2day  1third]!

13. And [3answered 4them 1the 2king] hard; and [2abandoned  1king 2Rehoboam] the counsel of the elders.

14. And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the younger men, saying,  My father oppressed  your yoke, and I will add upon it.  My father corrected you with whips, and I will correct you with scorpions.

15. And [3did not 4hearken to 1the 2king] the people. For he was converted from  God, that the lord should establish  his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat.

16. And all Israel saw that [3did not 4hearken 1the 2king] to them. And [3answered 1the 2people] to the king, saying, What is our portion with David, and the inheritance with the son of Jesse? Run to  your tents, O Israel! Now look  to your own house, David! And [3went 1all 2Israel] to  its tents.

17. And as far as the men of Israel  dwelling in the cities of Judah, [2reigned 3over 4them  1Rehoboam].

18. And [4sent 1Rehoboam 2the 3king]  Hadoram, the one over the tribute. And [4stoned 5him 1the 2sons 3of Israel] with stones, and he died. And  king Rehoboam hastened  to ascend into the chariot  to flee unto Jerusalem.

19. And Israel annulled allegiance to the house of David until  this day.  

## 2 Chronicles 11

1.  The Kingdom Is Divided And Rehoboam came into Jerusalem, and he held an assembly  of Judah and Benjamin -- a hundred eighty thousand young men for making war,  to wage war against Israel,  to return the kingdom to Rehoboam.

2. And came to pass the word of the lord to Shemaiah the man  of God, saying,

3. Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel, the one with Judah and Benjamin, saying!

4. Thus says the lord, You shall not ascend, and you shall not wage war against  your brethren. Let [2return 1each] to  his house! for [3from 4me 2took place  1this thing]. And they heeded the word of the lord, and they turned  to not go against Jeroboam.

5. And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and he built [2cities 1walled] in  Judea.

6. And he rebuilt  Beth-lehem and  Etam and  Tekoa,

7. and Beth-zur, and  Shoco, and  Adullam,

8. and  Gath, and  Mareshah, and  Ziph,

9. and  Adoraim, and Lachish, and  Azekah,

10. and  Zorah, and  Aijalon, and  Hebron, which are  [3of Judah 4and 5Benjamin 2cities 1walled].

11. And he fortified them with walls, and he appointed in them leaders, and provisions of foods, and olive oil and wine;

12. accordingly city by city with shields and spears. And he strengthened them in magnitude exceedingly, and [4were 5his 1Judah 2and 3Benjamin].

13. And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel, came together to him from out of all the borders.

14. For [3left behind 1the 2Levites]  their tents, the ones  of their possession, and they went to Judah unto Jerusalem, for [4cast them out 1Jeroboam 2and  3his sons]  to not officiate to the lord.

15. And he placed for himself priests of the high places, and for the idols, and for the vain things, and for the calves which Jeroboam made.

16. And he cast them out from the tribes of Israel, the ones who gave their heart  to seek the lord  God of Israel. And they came into Jerusalem to sacrifice to the lord, to the God  of their fathers.

17. And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and they strengthened Rehoboam son of Solomon for [2years 1three]; for he went by way of David and Solomon for [2years 1three].

18. And [2took 3to himself 1Rehoboam] for a wife  Mahalath daughter of Jerimoth son of David, and Abihail daughter of Eliab son of Jesse.

19. And she bore to him sons --  Jeush, and  Shamariah, and  Zaham.

20. And after these he took  Maachah to himself, the daughter of Absalom; and she bore to him  Abijah, and  Attai, and  Ziza, and  Shelomith.

21. And Rehoboam loved  Maacha daughter of Absalom above all  his wives and the concubines; for [3wives 2eighteen 1he had], and [2concubines 1sixty]. And he engendered twenty and eight sons, and [2daughters 1sixty].

22. And Rehoboam ordained  Abijah the son of Maacha as ruler, and for leader among  his brethren, for he considered to give him reign.

23. And he grew above all  his sons, in all the borders of Judah and Benjamin, and in the [2cities  1fortified]; and he gave to them [3of provisions 2multitude 1a vast]; and he asked for a multitude of wives.  

## 2 Chronicles 12

1.  Rehoboam Abandons the Commandments And it came to pass as [4was prepared 1the 2kingdom 3of Rehoboam], and as he was secure, he abandoned the law of the lord, and all Israel with him.

2. And it came to pass in the [2year  1fifth] of the kingdom of Rehoboam, [4ascended 1Shishak 2king 3of Egypt] up against Jerusalem, (for they sinned before the lord),

3. with a thousand and two hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen, and there was no count of the multitude  coming with him out of Egypt -- Lubim, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians. 

4.  Egypt Prevails Over Judah And they secured the [2cities  1fortified] which were in Judah, and they came to Jerusalem.

5. And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the rulers of Judah, the ones gathering together in Jerusalem from the face of Shishak. And he said to them, Thus said the lord, You abandoned me, and I shall abandon you into the hand of Shishak.

6. And [7were shamed 1the 2rulers 3of Israel 4and 5the 6king], and they said, [3is just 1the 2 lord].

7. And when  the lord saw that they were ashamed, [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Shemaiah, saying, They felt shame, I shall not utterly ruin them, but I will appoint them as small for deliverance, and in no way shall [2be dripped  1my rage] over Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak,

8. for they will be to him for servants, and they shall know  my servitude, and the servitude of the kingdom of the land.

9. And [4ascended 1Shishak 2king 3of Egypt] against Jerusalem, and he took the treasures of the ones in the house of the lord, and the treasures of the ones in the house of the king --  he took all, and he took the shields  of gold which Solomon made.

10. And [3made  1king 2Rehoboam] shields of brass instead of them, and placed them unto the hands of the rulers, of the ones being bodyguards, of the ones guarding the gatehouse of the king.

11. And it came to pass when it was fit in the entering by the king into the house of the lord, there went in also the bodyguards and they took the shields, and then restored them unto the place of the bodyguards.

12. And in  his feeling ashamed, [3was turned 4from 5him 1the anger 2of the lord], and not unto corruption unto the end,  for in Judah there were [2matters 1good].

13. And [3grew strong  1king 2Rehoboam] in Jerusalem, and reigned. [3a son 4of forty 5and 6one 7years old 2was 1Rehoboam] in  his taking reign. And seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, in the city which the lord chose to name  his name there, from out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel. And the name to his mother was Naammah the Ammonitess.

14. And he acted  wickedly, for he did not straighten out  his heart to seek after the lord.

15. And the words of Rehoboam, the first and last, [3not 1behold 2are they] written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet, and Iddo the seer  to trace descent and  his actions. And Rehoboam waged war and Jeroboam all the days.

16. And Rehoboam slept with  his fathers, and was entombed in the city of David. And [3reigned 1Abijah 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Chronicles 13

1.  Abijah Reigns in Judah, Jeroboam Reigns in Israel In the eighteenth year of the kingdom of Jeroboam, Abijah took reign over Judah.

2. Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Michaiah daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and between Jeroboam.

3. And Abijah deployed for the war with a force of warriors of power -- four hundred thousand [2men 1chosen]. And Jeroboam deployed against him for war with eight hundred thousand [2men 1chosen], mighty warriors of power.

4. And Abijah rose up from  mount Zemaraim, which is in  mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel!

5. Is it not to you to know that the lord  God of Israel appointed the kingdom to David over Israel into the eon, and to his sons for a covenant of salt?

6. And [4rose up 1Jeroboam  2son of 3Nebat], the servant of Solomon son of David, and revolted from  his master.

7. And there gathered together with him [2men 1mischievous], sons of lawbreakers, and they grew in strength against Rehoboam son of Solomon, and Rehoboam was younger and timid  in heart, and he did not fortify against their face.

8. And now you speak to oppose against the face of the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of David, and you are [2multitude 1a vast], and with you calves of gold which [2made 3for you 1Jeroboam] as gods.

9. Or did you not cast out the priests of the lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites; and you made to yourselves priests from the people of the land? Even every one  approaching  filling  his hand with a calf, an offspring of the herd, and [2rams 1seven], and he becomes as a priest to the one not being God.

10. And we [3the lord  4our God 1did not 2abandon]. And  his priests officiate to the lord, the sons of Aaron and the Levites in  their daily rotations.

11. And they burn to the lord whole burnt-offerings morning by morning, and  evening to evening, and they have the incense composition, and place settings of bread loaves upon the [2table  1pure], and the [2lamp-stand  1gold], and  its lamps  to light  evening by evening. For we guard the watch of the lord, the God  of our fathers; but you abandoned him.

12. And behold, with us as head is the lord, and  his priests, and the [2trumpets  1signal]  to signify against you. Sons of Israel, you should not wage war against the lord  God  of your fathers; for your ways shall not be prospered. 

13.  Jeroboam Sets an Ambush against Judah And Jeroboam circled  an ambush to come from behind them. And they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was from the places behind.

14. And Judah turned, and behold, the battle was against them from the places in front and from the places posterior. And they yelled to the lord, and the priests trumped the trumpets.

15. And [3shouted 1the men 2of Judah]. And it happened when [3shouted 1the men 2of Judah], that the lord struck  Jeroboam and  Israel before Abijah and Judah.

16. And [4fled 1the 2sons 3of Israel] from the face of Judah, and [2delivered 3them 1the lord] into  their hands. 

17.  Abijah Strikes Jeroboam And [4struck  5them 1Abijah 2and  3his people 7calamity 6with a great]. And there fell slain of Israel -- five hundred thousand [2men 1mighty].

18. And [4were abased 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in  that day, and [4grew strong 1the 2sons 3of Judah], for they hoped upon the lord the God  of their fathers.

19. And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and first took from him the cities  of Beth-el and  her towns, and  Jeshanah and  her towns, and  Ephrain and  her towns.

20. And [2did not 3have 4strength 1Jeroboam] any more during all the days of Abijah. And [2struck 3him 1the lord], and he died.

21. And Abijah grew strong, and took for himself [2wives 1fourteen], and engendered twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

22. And the rest of the words of Abijah, and  his actions, and  his words, are written upon the scroll in the inquiry of Iddo the prophet.  

## 2 Chronicles 14

1.  Asa Reigns in Judah And Abijah slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him in the city of David. And [3took reign 1Asa 2his son] instead of him. In the days of Asa [4was quiet 1the 2land 3of Judah] for ten years.

2. And he did the good and the upright thing before the lord  his God.

3. And he removed the altars of the aliens, and the high places, and he broke the monuments, and cut down the sacred groves.

4. And he spoke to Judah,  to seek after the lord  God  of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandments.

5. And he removed from all of the cities of Judah the altars and the idols; and [3was at peace 1the 2kingdom] before him.

6. And he built [2cities 1walled] in the land of Judah; for there was peace in the land, and there was no war to him in  these years, for [2gave rest 3to him 1the lord].

7. And he said to Judah, We should build  these cities, and we should make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars, in which  land we dominate, for as we sought the lord  our God, he sought us, and rested us round about. And they built and prospered.

8. And there was to Asa a force of armor-bearers lifting shields and spears in Judah -- three hundred thousand. And in Benjamin men armed with small shields, and bowmen -- two hundred and eighty thousand, all these were warriors of power. 

9.  Ethiopia Attacks Judah And [4came forth 5against 6them 1Zarai 2the 3Ethiopian] in a force with a thousand thousand, and with [2chariots 1three hundred]; and he came unto Mareshah.

10. And Asa came forth to meet against him, and he deployed for war in the ravine to the north of Mareshah.

11. And Asa yelled to the lord his God, and said, O lord, it is not impossible for you to deliver by many or by few. Help us, O lord  our God, for upon you we yield, and in  your name we came against  [2multitude  1this vast]. O lord  our God. You are the God. Let not [2prevail 3against 4you 1man]!

12. And the lord struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.

13. And [2pursued 3them 1Asa] and  his people unto Gerar. And [3fell 1the 2Ethiopians] so as to not be in procurement of safety for themselves; for they were defeated before the lord, and before  his force. And they despoiled [2spoils 1many].

14. And they knocked down  their towns round about Gerar; for there became a change of state of the lord upon them. And they plundered all  their cities; for many spoils came to them.

15. And indeed the tents of the cattle they cut down, and they took [2sheep 1many] and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.  

## 2 Chronicles 15

1.  Azariah's Prophecy And Azariah son of Oded -- [3came 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of God].

2. And he went forth for meeting with Asa. And he said to him, Hear me Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! The lord is with you in  your being with him. And if you seek after him, he shall be found by you. And if you should abandon him, he will abandon you.

3. For [2days passed 1many] to Israel without the true God, and no priest to plainly show things, and with no law.

4. And he shall turn them in affliction unto the lord the God of Israel, and they shall seek him, and he shall be found by them.

5. And in [2times 1those] there is no peace to the one going forth, and to the one entering, for much astonishment was upon all the ones dwelling places.

6. And [2shall wage war 1nation] against nation, and city against city, for  God startled them in every affliction.

7. And you, be strong and do not loosen  your hands! for there is a wage  for your work. 

8.  Asa's Reforms And in  Asa hearing  of these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, that he prevailed, and cast out the loathsome things of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities which he took control of from Jeroboam, from the mountains of Ephraim. And he dedicated the altar of the lord, which was in front of the temple of the lord.

9. And he assembled  Judah and Benjamin, and the foreigners  sojourning with him from out of Ephraim, and from out of Manasseh, and from out of Simeon; for [4were added 5to 6him 2from 3Israel 1many] in  their seeing that the lord  God himself was with him.

10. And they gathered in Jerusalem in the [2month  1third], in the [2year  1fifteenth] of the kingdom of Asa.

11. And they sacrificed to the lord in  that day from the spoils which they brought [2calves 1of seven hundred] and [2sheep 1seven thousand].

12. And they went into a covenant to seek the lord  God  of their fathers with [2entire  3heart 1their], and with [2entire  3soul 1their].

13. And all who ever did not seek after the lord  God  of Israel shall die, from younger unto older, from man unto woman.

14. And they swore by an oath to the lord with [2voice 1a great], and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with horns.

15. And [3was glad 4on account of 5the 6oath 1all 2Judah]; for from [2entire  3soul 1their] they swore by an oath, and with all their volition they sought him; and he was found by them. And the lord gave rest to them round about.

16. And  [3Maachah 4the 5mother 1Asa 6of the 7king 2removed] to not be  officiating to Ashtoreth; and he cut in pieces the idol, and incinerated it at the rushing stream Kidron.

17. Except the high places were not removed, for they existed in  Israel. Only the heart of Asa was perfect all  his days.

18. And he carried in the holy things  of his father, and  his own holy things into the house  of God -- silver and gold and vessels.

19. And war was not with him until the thirtieth and fifth year of the kingdom of Asa.  

## 2 Chronicles 16

1.  Baasha Reigns in Israel And in the [3year 1thirtieth 2and sixth] of the kingdom of Asa, [4ascended 1Baasha 2king 3of Israel] against Judah. And he built  Ramah  to not give an exit nor entrance  to Asa king of Judah.

2. And Asa took silver and gold from out of the treasuries of the house of the lord, and from the house of the king, and he sent to the son  of Hadad king of Syria, the one dwelling in Damascus, saying,

3. Ordain a covenant between me and between you, and between  my father and between  your father! Behold, I have sent to you gold and silver. Come, and efface  your covenant with Baasha king of Israel! and he shall go forth from me.

4. And [3hearkened to 1the son 2of Hadad]  king Asa, and sent the rulers  of his force against the cities of Israel. And he struck  Ijon, and  Dan, and  Abel-maim, and all the places round about Naphtali.

5. And it happened when  Baasha heard, that he left off  to no longer build  Ramah, and he rested  his work.

6. And king Asa took all  Judah; and he lifted away all the stones  of Ramah, and  its timbers which Baasha built with; and he built with them Geba and  Mizpah. 

7.  Hanani Rebukes Asa And in  that time [4came 1Hanani 2the 3prophet] to Asa king of Judah, and said to him; Because  you relied upon the king of Syria, and [2did not 3rely 1you] upon the lord your God, on account of this [5came through safe 1the 2force 3of the king 4of Syria] from  your hand.

8. [2not 3the 4Ethiopians 5and 6Lubim 1Were  8force 7a vast], and of courage for chariots and horsemen in multitude, exceedingly? And in  your relying upon the lord, he delivered them into  your hands.

9. For the eyes of the lord look in all the earth to strengthen with every heart perfect towards him. You have known about this; from  now on [2will be 3with 4you 1war].

10. And Asa was enraged with the prophet, and he placed him in the house of the prison, for he was angry over this. And Asa laid waste among the people at  that time.

11. And behold, the words of Asa, the first and the last, are written upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.

12. And Asa was infirm in the [4year  1thirtieth 2and 3ninth]  of his kingdom in  his feet, until [2was higher  1his infirmity]. And in  his infirmity he did not seek the lord, but the physicians.

13. And Asa slept with  his fathers, and he came to an end in the fortieth and first year  of his kingdom.

14. And they entombed him in the tomb in which he dug for himself in the city of David. And they rested him upon the bed, and they filled it of aromatics, and types [2perfumes 1of scented]. And they made for him [2funeral 1a great], and they kindled him [2burning 1 a great] -- unto exceedingly.  

## 2 Chronicles 17

1.  Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah And [3reigned 1Jehoshaphat 2his son] instead of him. And Jehoshaphat strengthened against  Israel.

2. And he put a force in all the [2cities 3of Judah  1fortified], and he put leaders in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which [3first took 1Asa  2his father].

3. And the lord was with Jehoshaphat, for he went in [3ways 4of David  5his father 1the 2first]; and he did not seek after the idols,

4. but [2the lord  3God  4of his father 1he sought after], and by  his commandments he went, and not according to the works of Israel.

5. And the lord straightened the kingdom in his hand; and [3gave 1all 2Judah] gifts to Jehoshaphat, and there became to him [2riches 3and 4glory 1much].

6. And [2was raised up high  1his heart] in the ways of the lord. And again he removed the high places and the sacred groves from the land of Judah. 

7.  Teachings of The LORD Restored And in the [2year  1third]  of his kingship, he sent  his leaders, and the sons of the mighty ones --  Obadiah, and  Zechariah, and  Nethaneel, and  Michaiah  to teach in the cities of Judah.

8. And with them the Levites -- Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.

9. And they taught in  Judah, and with them was the book of the law of the lord. And they went through in the cities of Judah and taught the people.

10. And there came to pass a change of state of the lord upon all the kingdoms of the land round about Judah, and they did not wage war against Jehoshaphat.

11. And from the Philistines they brought  to Jehoshaphat gifts and silver. And also the Arabians brought to him rams of the flocks -- seven thousand seven hundred; he-goats -- seven thousand seven hundred.

12. And Jehoshaphat was going in greatness unto height, and he built [2in  3Judah 1places of abode], and [2cities 1fortified].

13. And [2works 1many] were taking place by him in  Judah. And [2men 3warriors 1mighty] being strong were in Jerusalem.

14. And this is the number of them according to the houses of their families. And  to Judah as commanders of thousands -- Adnah the ruler, and with him [2sons 1mighty] of power -- three hundred thousand.

15. And after him Johahnan the ruler, and with him two hundred eighty thousand.

16. And after him, Amasiah the son of Zichri, the one feeling eager to the lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of power.

17. And from  Benjamin the mighty man of power Eliada, and with him bowmen and men armed with small shields -- two hundred thousand.

18. And after him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred eighty thousand mighty men of war.

19. These were the ones officiating to the king, outside of the ones whom [3put 1the 2king] in the [2cities  1fortified] in all  Judea.  

## 2 Chronicles 18

1.  Jehoshaphat and Ahab Allied in Marriage And there came  to Jehoshaphat still [2riches 3and 4glory 1much]. And he was allied by marriage with the house of Ahab.

2. And he went down at the end of years to Ahab in Samaria. And [2sacrificed 3to him 1Ahab] sheep and calves in abundance, and to the people  with him; and he persuaded him  to go up with him unto Ramoth Gilead.

3. And [4said 1Ahab 2king 3of Israel] to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth  of Gilead? And he said to him, As you, so also I; and as  your people, also  my people; even with you for war.

4. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us seek indeed today the word of the lord!

5. And [4gathered 1the 2king 3of Israel] the prophets -- four hundred men. And he said to them, Shall I go to Ramoth Gilead for war, or should I wait? And they said, Ascend! and God shall give them into the hands of the king.

6. And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the lord yet, that we shall seek anxiously by him?

7. And [4said 1the 2the king 3of Israel] to Jehoshaphat, There is [2man 1one]  to seek the lord through him, and I detest him; for he is not prophesying [3concerning 4me 1for 2good things], for all  his days are for bad things. He is Michaiah son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not [3speak 1the 2king] thus!

8. And [4called 1the 2king 3of Israel 6eunuch 5one], and said, Quickly call Michaiah son of Imla!

9. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each upon his throne, being clothed with robes; they sat down in the broad space at the door of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.

10. And [4made 5for himself 1Zedekiah 2son 3of Chenaanah] horns of iron, and he said, Thus says the lord; With these you shall gore the Syrian until whenever he should be finished off entirely.

11. And all the prophets prophesied thus, saying, Ascend unto Ramoth Gilead! and you shall prosper in the way, and the lord will give it into the hands of the king.

12. And the messenger, the one going  to call  Michaiah, spoke to him, saying, Behold, [3spoke 1the 2prophets 5with 7mouth 6one 4good things] concerning the king. And let [3be 2indeed  1your words] as one of them! and you shall speak good things. 

13.  Michaiah Prophecies before Ahab And Michaiah said, As the lord lives, that what ever God should say to me, it I shall speak.

14. And he came to the king. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], Michaiah, Shall I go to Ramoth Gilead for war, or should I wait? And he said, Ascend! and your way shall prosper, and they shall be given into your hands.

15. And [3said 4to him 1the 2king], How often shall I bind you by an oath that you should not speak to me except the truth in the name of the lord?

16. And Michaiah said, I see  Israel all being scattered in the mountains, as sheep in which there is no shepherd. And the lord said, [2have no 3leader 1These]. Let them [2return 1each] to  his house in peace.

17. And [4said 1the 2king 3of Israel] to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy for my good things, but only bad things?

18. And Michaiah said, It is not so. Hear the word of the lord! I beheld the lord sitting upon his throne, and all the force of the heaven stood beside at his right and at his left.

19. And the lord said, Who shall deceive  Ahab king of Israel, that he shall ascend, and shall fall in Ramoth Gilead? And this one spoke thus, and this other one spoke thus.

20. And came forth the spirit, and stood in the presence of the lord, and said, I shall deceive him. And the lord said, By what means?

21. And he said, I shall go forth, and I will be [2spirit 1a lying] in the mouth of all  his prophets. And he said, You shall deceive, and shall prevail. Go forth, and do so!

22. And now, behold, the lord put [2spirit 1a lying] in the mouths of all  [2your prophets 1these], and the lord spoke against you for bad things.

23. And [4approached 1Zedekiah 2son 3of Chenaanah] and struck  Michaiah upon the jaw, and said to him, By what  way passed the spirit of the lord from me  to speak to you?

24. And Michaiah said, Behold, you shall see in  that day in which you shall enter closet by closet  to hide.

25. And [3said 1the king 2of Israel], Take  Michaiah and return him to Amon the ruler of the city, and to Joash the son of the king.

26. And you shall say, Thus says the king, Put this one into [2house 1a prison], and let him eat bread of affliction and water of affliction! until  my return in peace.

27. And Michaiah said, If by returning, you should return in peace, [2did not 3speak 1the lord] by me. And he said, Hearken all peoples!

28. And [7ascended 1the king 2of Israel 3and 4Jehoshaphat 5king 6of Judah] to Ramoth Gilead.

29. And [3said 1the king 2of Israel] to Jehoshaphat, I shall cover up and enter into the battle; but you put on  my clothes! And [3covered up 1the king 2of Israel], and entered into the battle. 

30.  Ahab Dies in Battle And the king of Syria gave charge to the heads of the chariots, to the ones with him, saying, Do not wage war with the small and the great, but the king of Israel only.

31. And it came to pass as [5saw 1the 2ones in charge 3of the 4chariots]  Jehoshaphat, that they said, [2the king 3of Israel 1It is]. And they encircled him  to do battle. And Jehoshaphat yelled, and the lord delivered him, and [2turned 3them  1God] from him.

32. And it came to pass as [5saw 1the 2ones in charge 3of the 4chariots] that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned from him.

33. And a man stretched tight a bow skillfully and struck the king of Israel between the lungs, and between the chest plate. And he said to the charioteer, Turn  your hand, and lead me from the battle! for I am wounded.

34. And [3turned 1the 2battle] in  that day. And the king of Israel was set upon the chariot right opposite Syria until evening, and he died in the going down of the sun.  

## 2 Chronicles 19

1.  Jehu the Prophet Rebukes Jehoshaphat And [4returned 1Jehoshaphat 2king 3of Judah] to  his house in peace into Jerusalem.

2. And came forth to meet him Jehu the son of Hanani the prophet. And he said to  king Jehoshaphat, Shall [3a sinner 1you 2help], or [3one being detested 4by 5the lord 1do you 2befriend], no. Because of this [3took place 4against 5you 1the anger 2of the lord].

3. But [2words 1good] were found in you, for you removed the sacred groves from the land of Judah, and straightened out  your heart to seek after the lord.

4. And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem. And again he went forth to the people from Beer-sheba unto mount Ephraim, and turned them unto the lord the God  of their fathers.

5. And he placed judges in all the cities of Judah, the fortified ones, in city by city.

6. And he said to the judges, Know what you do, for not unto man do you judge, but to the lord, and with you are the words of judgment.

7. And now, let [4be 1the 2fear 3of the lord] upon you, and guard and act! for [2is not 3with 4the lord 5our God 1injustice], nor admiring a face, nor taking bribes.

8. And indeed in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat placed of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the patriarchs of Israel, for the judgment of the lord, and to judge the ones dwelling in Jerusalem.

9. And he gave charge to them, saying, Thus you shall do in the fear of the lord, in truth, and with a full heart.

10. Every man with a judgment  coming unto you  of your brethren  dwelling in  their cities, whether between blood for blood, and between the order and commandment, and for ordinances and judgments, that you shall warn them, that they shall not sin against the lord, that there will not be anger against you, and against  your brethren -- thus you shall do, and you shall not sin.

11. And behold, Amariah the [2priest 1leading] over you is for every matter of the lord; and Zebadiah son of Ishmael is the leader in the house of Judah for every word of the king. And the scribes, the Levites, are before you. Be strong and act! and the lord will be with the good.  

## 2 Chronicles 20

1.  The Nations Wage War on Jehoshaphat And after these things came the sons of Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and with them ones of the Ammonites against Jehoshaphat for war.

2. And they came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, [3comes 4against 5you 2multitude 1a vast] from the other side of the sea, from Syria; and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar -- this is En-gedi.

3. And Jehoshaphat feared and put  his face to seek after the lord. And he proclaimed a fast in all Judah.

4. And Judah gathered to seek after the lord; and they came from all the cities of Judah to seek the lord.

5. And Jehoshaphat rose up in the assembly of Judah in Jerusalem, in the house of the lord, in front of the [2courtyard  1new],

6. and he said, O lord  God  of our fathers, [2you not 1are] God in heaven? And do you not dominate all the kingdoms of the nations? And is not in  your hand strength and dominion, and there is no one [2against 3you  1to oppose]?

7. [2you not 1Are]  our God, the one utterly destroying the ones dwelling  this land from in front  of your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham, to your friend into the eon?

8. And they dwell in it, and built to you in it a sanctuary to your name, saying,

9. If [2should come 3against 4us 1evils] -- the broadsword, judgment, plague, famine, we will stand before  this house, and before you, (for  your name is called upon in  this house,) and we will yell to you from  our affliction, and you shall hear and shall deliver. 

10.  The Battle Is The LORD's And now, behold, the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, in which you did not grant  Israel to go through them, in their coming forth from out of the land of Egypt, for they turned aside from them, and they did not utterly destroy them --

11. and behold, they make an attempt against us,  to come and to cast us from  our inheritance, of which you have given to us.

12. O lord  our God, will you not judge  them? For there is not to us strength  to oppose against  [2multitude  1this vast]  coming against us. And we do not know what we should do, but [2are unto 3you  1our eyes].

13. And all Judah stood before the lord, and  their children, and  their wives, and  their sons.

14. And Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah the Levite of the sons of Asaph -- came upon him spirit of the lord in the assembly.

15. And he said, Hearken all Judah, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, and  king Jehoshaphat! Thus says the lord to you, Do not fear nor be terrified from the face  [3multitude  2vast 1of this]! for [4not 5to you 3is 1the 2battle array], but  to God.

16. Tomorrow go down against them! Behold, they ascend according to the ascent of Ziz; and you shall find them at the tip of the river of the wilderness of Jeruel.

17. [2not 3for you 1It is] to wage war in this. Stand, and perceive, and see the deliverance of the lord with you, O Judah, and Jerusalem! Do not fear nor be terrified tomorrow coming forth for meeting them! for the lord is with you.

18. And Jehoshaphat bowed upon his face upon the earth; and all Judah and the ones dwelling Jerusalem fell before the lord,  to do obeisance to the lord.

19. And [3rose up 1the 2Levites] from the sons of Kohath, and from the sons of the of Korahites,  to give praise to the lord, to the God of Israel with [2voice 1a great] unto the height.

20. And they rose early in the morning, and they went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. But in  their going forth, Jehoshaphat stood and yelled, and said, Hear me, O Judah, and O ones dwelling in Jerusalem! Entrust in the lord  your God! and you will be entrusted. Entrust in his prophet! and your way will be prosperous.

21. And being advised with the people, and he stationed psalm singers and ones praising the lord,  to acknowledge and to praise in the holy, in the going forth before the force. And they said, Give acknowledgment to the lord, for into the eon  is his mercy!

22. And when  they began the praise and the acknowledgment, the lord appointed an ambush  [4to wage war 1for the 2sons 3of Ammon] against Moab and mount Seir of the ones coming forth against Judah; and they put them to flight. 

23.  Jeshoshaphat's Enemies Destroy Themselves And there rose up the sons of Ammon and Moab against the ones dwelling in mount Seir, to utterly destroy and to obliterate them. And as they finished off the ones dwelling in Seir, they rose up against one another, and [2took 1a man]  his neighbor for hurt.

24. And Judah came upon the height in the wilderness, and looked. And they beheld the multitude, and behold, all were dead having fallen upon the ground; there was not one surviving.

25. And Jehoshaphat came forth, and  his people, to despoil  their spoils. And they found [2cattle 1much], and belongings, and spoils, and [2items 1desirable]. And they despoiled for themselves. And they were [2days 1three] plundering the spoils, for there was much.

26. And on the [2day  1fourth] they assembled in the Valley of the Blessing; for there they blessed the lord. On account of this they call the name  of that place, Valley of Blessing, until  this day.

27. And [4returned 1every 2man 3of Judah] to Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat the one leading them returned to Jerusalem in [2gladness 1great], for [2gladdened 3them 1the lord] from  their enemies.

28. And they entered into Jerusalem with stringed instruments, and lutes, and with trumpets into the house of the lord.

29. And came to pass a change of state of the lord upon all the kingdoms of the earth, in  their hearing that the lord waged war with the ones being opponents of Israel.

30. And [4had peace 1the 2kingdom 3of Jehoshaphat], and [2rested 3him  1his God] round about.

31. And Jehoshaphat reigned over  Judah, being thirty-five years old in  his taking reign, and twenty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.

32. And he went in the ways of Asa  his father. And he did not turn aside from them,  to do  upright before the lord.

33. Only the high places he did not remove, and still the people did not straighten out  their heart to the lord  God  of their fathers.

34. And the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which he wrote down upon a scroll of the kings of Israel.

35. And after these things, [4participated 1Jehoshaphat 2king 3of Judah] with Ahaziah king of Israel. And he acted lawlessly  to do.

36. And he participated with him  to make boats even to go to Tarshish. And he made boats in Ezion Gaber.

37. And [7prophesied 1Eliezer 2the 3son of 4Dodavah 5from 6Mareshah] against Jehoshaphat, saying, As you participated with  Ahaziah, the lord cut through  your works, and [2were broken  1your boats], and they were not able  to go into Tarshish.  

## 2 Chronicles 21

1.  Jehoram Reigns in Judah And Jehoshaphat slept with  his fathers, and he was entombed with  his fathers in the city of David. And [3reigned 1Jehoram 2his son] instead of him.

2. And to him were brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat -- Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.

3. And [2gave 3to them  1their father 5gifts 4many] -- silver, and gold, and shields, with  cities being walled in Judah. But the kingdom he gave  to Jehoram, for he was the first-born.

4. And Jehoram rose over the kingdom  of his father, and was strengthened, and he killed all  his brothers by the broadsword, and indeed some of the rulers of Israel.

5. His being thirty and two years old was Jehoram in  his reigning, and eight years he reigned in Jerusalem.

6. And he went in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab was to him for a wife. And he did the wicked thing before the lord.

7. And [2did not 3want 1the lord] to utterly destroy the house of David on account of the covenant which he ordained  with David, and as he said to him, to give him a lamp and to his sons all the days. 

8.  Edom Revolts from Judah In  those days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they gave [2reign 3over 4themselves 1a king].

9. And Jehoram set out with  his rulers, and all  his chariots, and all the cavalry, the one with him. And it came to pass that he arose by night and struck  Edom, the one encircling him, and the rulers of the chariots.

10. And Edom revolted from the hand of Judah until  this day. Then Libnah revolted in  that time from under his hand, for he abandoned the lord  God  of his fathers.

11. Moreover he made the high places in the cities of Judah, and fornicated the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, and led Judah astray. 

12.  The Warning of Elijah And there came to him in writing words by Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the lord, the God of David  your father, Because you did not go in the way of Jehoshaphat  your father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

13. and went in the ways of the king of Israel, and fornicated  Judah, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, as [3fornicated 1the house 2of Ahab], and also  your brothers, sons  of your father, the good ones over you, you killed.

14. Behold, the lord shall strike you [2calamity 1with a great] among  your people, and among  your sons, and among  your wives, and among all  your belongings;

15. and you shall be in [2sicknesses 1severe] in disease of your bellies, until of which time [2should come forth  1your innards] from the sickness of days by days. 

16.  The Nations War against Judah And the lord roused [3against 4Jehoram 1the 2Philistines], and the Arabians, and the ones adjoining the Ethiopians.

17. And they ascended against Judah, and overpowered it, and captured all the possessions which they found in the house of the king, and the houses of his sons, and  his daughters. And there was not left to him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest  of his sons.

18. And after all these things [2struck 3him 1the lord] in  his belly with a sickness in which there is no healing.

19. And it happened from days unto days, and as [2came  1his time] in [2days 1two], there came forth  his innards with  his belly in his sickness. And he died in [2sicknesses 1severe], and [2did not make 4to him  1his people 3a funeral], nor a burning according to the burning  of his fathers.

20. He was thirty and two years old in  his reigning, and eight years he reigned in Jerusalem. And he went in not high praise. And they entombed him in the city of David, and not in the tombs of the kings.  

## 2 Chronicles 22

1.  Ahaziah Reigns in Judah And [5gave reign 1the ones 2dwelling 3in 4Jerusalem]  to Ahaziah his son, the youngest, instead of him; for all the elder sons were killed by the ones coming upon them -- the band of robbers, the Arabians. And [6reigned 1Ahaziah 2son 3of Jehoram 4king 5of Judah].

2. [2was a son 3being 4forty 5and 6two 7years old 1Ahaziah] in  his reigning, and [3year 2one 1he reigned] in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Athaliah daughter of Omri.

3. And also he went in the ways of the house of Ahab, for  his mother was his counselor to sin.

4. And he did the wicked thing in the eyes of the lord, as the house of Ahab; for they were to him counselors after the dying  of his father  to utterly destroy him.

5. And [2by  3their counsels 1he went]. And he went with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel for war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth Gilead. And [3struck 1the 2bowmen]  Jehoram.

6. And Jehoram returned  to be treated medically in Jezreel from the wounds which [3struck 4him 1the 2Syrians] in Ramoth, in  his warring against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah son of Jehoram, king of Judah went down to see  Jehoram son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was infirm.

7. And by  God came the final event of Ahaziah  in his coming to Jehoram. And in  his coming, Jehoram went forth with him against Jehu son of Nimshi, the anointed of the lord, whom [2anointed 3him 1the lord]  to utterly destroy the house of Ahab.

8. And it came to pass in  [2taking vengeance  1Jehu] on the house of Ahab, that he found the rulers of Judah, and the brothers of Ahaziah, the ones officiating to Ahaziah, and he killed them.

9. And Jehu told them  to seek  Ahaziah. And they overtook him in his being treated medically in Samaria, and they led him to Jehu, and he killed him. And they entombed him, for they said, He is a son of Jehoshaphat who sought the lord with [2entire 3heart 1his]. And there was not anyone in the house of Ahaziah prevailing with power over the kingdom. 

10.  Athaliah Kills the Royal Seed And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that [2died  1her son], and she rose up and destroyed all the seed of the kingdom in the house of Judah.

11. But [6took 1Jehoshabeath 2the 3daughter 4of the 5king]  Joash son of Ahaziah, and stole him from the midst of the sons of the king, of the ones being put to death. And she put him and  his nourishment in the storeroom of the beds. And [5hid 6him 1the 2daughter  3of king 4Jehoram], Jehoshabeath the sister of Ahaziah the wife of Jehoiada the priest. And she hid him from the face  of Athaliah, and she did not kill him.

12. And he was being hid with her in the house  of God six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.

2. And they encircled  Judah, and gathered the Levites from out of all the cities of Judah, and the rulers of the families  of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

3. And [4ordained 1all 2the 3assembly] a covenant in the house  of God with the king. And he said to them, Behold, the son of the king, let him reign! as the lord spoke concerning the house of David.

4. And now this is the word what you shall do. The third of you [6enter 7on the 8Sabbath 1of the 2priests 3and 4of the 5Levites], and go unto the gates of the entrances;

5. and the third unto the house of the king; and the third unto the gate the one in the middle! And all the people will be in the courtyards of the house of the lord.

6. And let no one enter into the house of the lord, except the priests and the Levites, and the ones officiating to the Levites! They shall enter, for they are holy. And all the people let guard the watches of the lord!

7. And [3shall encircle 1the 2Levites] the king round about, each man and  his weapon in his hand, and the one entering into the house shall die. And they will be with the king for his entering and exiting.

8. And [6did 1the 2Levites 3and 4all 5Judah] according to all as much as [4gave charge 1Jehoiada 2the 3priest]. And [2took 1each man]  his men entering on the Sabbath, unto exiting of the Sabbath, for [4did not 5rest up 1Jehoiada 2the 3priest] the daily rotations.

9. And [4gave 1Jehoiada 2the 3priest] the commanders of hundreds orders, and the swords, and the large shields, and the small shields which was of king David in the house  of God.

10. And he stationed all the people, each with  his weapons, from the protrusion of the house at the right, unto the protrusion of the house at the left by the altar, and at the house by the king round about.

11. And he led out the son of the king, and put upon him the crown, and the testimony, and they made him to reign. And [6anointed 7him 1Jehoiada 2the 3priest 4and  5his sons], and they said, Let [3live 1the 2king]!

12. And Athaliah heard the sound of the people, of the ones running, and acknowledging, and praising the king. And she entered to the king, into the house of the lord.

13. And she beheld, and behold, the king stood at  his station, and at the entrance were the rulers and the trumpets. And the rulers were around the king. And all the people of the land were being glad and trumpeting with the trumpets, and the ones singing with the instruments of the odes, the singers and ones singing praise. And Athaliah tore  her robe, and yelled and said, Conspiracy, conspiracy.

14. And came forth Jehoiada the priest, and he gave charge to the commanders of hundreds, and to the chiefs of the force. And said to them, Lead her outside of the house, and go forth after her, and let her die by the sword! For [3said 1the 2priest], Let her not die in the house of the lord! 

15.  Athaliah Put to Death And they placed [2upon 3her 1hands], and she went through the gate of the horsemen of the house of the king, and they put her to death there.

16. And Jehoiada ordained a covenant between he and between the people, and between the king,  to be for a people to the lord.

17. And [6entered 1all 2the 3people 4of the 5land] into the house  of Baal, and tore it down, and  his altars; and  his images they ground fine; and  [2Mattan 3the 4priest of Baal 1they put to death] before  his altars.

18. And [4committed 1Jehoiada 2the 3priest] the works of the house of the lord in the hand of the priests and Levites. And he reestablished the daily rotations of the priests and the Levites, as David separated for the house of the lord,  to offer to the lord whole burnt-offerings, as is written in the law of Moses, with gladness and with odes by the hand of David.

19. And [3stood 1the 2gatekeepers] at the gates of the house of the lord, that there shall not enter [3unclean 1in 2anything].

20. And he took the patriarchs, and the mighty ones, and the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and they conducted the king into the the house of the lord; and he entered through the inner gate into the house of the king. And they sat the king upon the throne of the kingdom.

21. And [6were glad 1all 2the 3people 4of the 5land], and the city was still. And  Athaliah they put to death by the sword.  

## 2 Chronicles 24

1.  Joash Repairs the House of The LORD [2was 4years old 3seven 1Joash] in  his taking reign, and forty years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Zibeah from Beer-sheba.

2. And Joash did the upright thing before the lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

3. And Jehoiada took two wives to himself, and he engendered sons and daughters.

4. And it came to pass after these things, that it came upon the heart of Joash to repair the house of the lord.

5. And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and he said to them, Go forth into the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money  to repair the house of the lord  your God until fit, year by year! And hasten to speak! And [3hastened not 1the 2Levites].

6. And [3called 1the 2king]  Jehoiada the ruler, and he said to him, Why did you not require concerning the Levites, so as to carry in from Judah and Jerusalem the adjudged concern by Moses the man  of God, for the assembly  of Israel in the tent of the testimony?

7. For Athaliah was lawless, and  her sons tore down the house  of God; and also all the holy things of the house of the lord they appointed to the Baals.

8. And [3said 1the 2king], Let there be a container, and let it be put at the gate of the house of the lord outside!

9. And let them proclaim in Judah and in Jerusalem, to carry in to the lord as [4said 1Moses 2the servant  3of God] unto  Israel in the wilderness.

10. And [3were glad 1all 2the rulers] and all the people; and they carried in, and cast into the container, until of which it was filled.

11. And it came to pass in the time  to bring in the container to the superintendents of the king by the hand of the Levites, that when they beheld that [3was superabundant 1the 2money], that [5came 1the 2scribe 3of the 4king], and the superintendent of the great priest; and they emptied out the container, and they lifted and placed it upon  its place. Thus they did day by day, and they gathered [2money 1much].

12. And [7gave 8it 1the 2king 3and 4Jehoiada 5the 6priest] to the ones doing the works for the work of the house of the lord. And they hired quarriers and fabricators to repair the house of the lord, and braziers of iron and of brass  to strengthen the house of the lord.

13. And [5did so 1the 2ones doing 3the 4works], and there ascended the length of the works by their hands. And they reestablished the house of the lord in  its position, and they strengthened it.

14. And as they completed, they brought to the king and to Jehoiada the rest of the money, and they made with it items for the house of the lord, items for the ministry, and of the whole burnt-offerings, and incense pans, and [4vessels 1gold 2and 3silver]. And they offered whole burnt-offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of Jehoiada.

15. And Jehoiada grew old, and was full of days. And he came to an end [2a son 1being] a hundred and thirty years at  his coming to an end.

16. And they entombed him in the city of David with the kings, for he did goodness with Israel, and with  God, and  his house.

17. And it came to pass after the decease of Jehoiada, [4entered 1the 2rulers 3of Judah] and did obeisance to the king. Then [3heeded 1the 2king] them. 

18.  Judah Abandons the House of The LORD And they abandoned the house of the lord the God  of their fathers, and they served to Ashtoreth and the idols. And there came anger against Judah and against Jerusalem in  their trespass.

19. And he sent to them prophets to turn them to the lord. And they testified to them, and they hearkened not.

20. And spirit of God was put on  Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he rose above the people, and said to them, Thus says the lord, Why do you pass by the commandments of the lord, and your way shall not prosper? For you abandoned the lord, and he shall abandon you. 

21.  Joash Kills the Son of Jehoiada And they assailed against him, and stoned him with stones by command of Joash the king in the courtyard of the house of the lord.

22. And [4did not 5remember 1Joash 2the 3king] the mercy of which [3performed 1Jehoiada  2his father] with him, and he put [2to death  1his son]. And as he died, he said, The lord behold even to judge!

23. And it came to pass at the completion of the year, [3ascended 4against 5him 1the force 2of Syria], and came against Judah, and against Jerusalem, and they utterly destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the people; and all  their spoils they sent to the king of Damascus.

24. For [4with 5a few 6men 3came 1the force 2of Syria], but  God delivered up into  their hands [3force 2vast 1an exceedingly], for they abandoned the lord the God  of their fathers. And with Joash they executed judgments.

25. And after  their going forth from him, in  abandoning him with [2infirmities 1great], that [2assailed 3against him  1his servants] because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest; and they killed him upon  his bed, and he died. And they entombed him in the city of David, but they did not entomb him in the tomb of the kings.

26. And the ones assailing against him -- Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.

27. And his sons, and the greatest concerns about him, and the groundwork of the house  of God, and the rest, behold, it is written upon the writing of the scroll of the kings. And [3reigned 1Amaziah 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Chronicles 25

1.  Amaziah Reigns in Judah A son being twenty and five years old was Amaziah in  his taking reign. And twenty and nine years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name  of his mother was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

2. And he did the upright thing before the lord, but not with [2heart 1a full].

3. And it came to pass as [3was placed 1the 2kingdom] in his hand, that he killed  his servants -- the ones murdering [2the 3king  1his father].

4. And  their sons were not killed according to the covenant of the law of the lord, as is written in the law of Moses, as the lord gave charge, saying, [2shall not die 1fathers] for the children, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, but only each  for his own sin shall die.

5. And Amaziah gathered the house of Judah, and he established them according to the houses of their families for commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds, in all Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and up. And he found of them three hundred thousand mighty ones going forth for war, mighty ones holding spear and shield.

6. And he hired from Israel a hundred thousand mighty ones in strength for a hundred talents of silver.

7. And the man  of God came to him, saying, O king, let not [3go 4with 5you 1the force 2of Israel]! for [2is not 1the lord] with Israel -- of any of the sons of Ephraim.

8. For if you should undertake  to grow strong by these in the battle, the lord will put you to flight before the enemies, for there is strength to the lord  to help, and to put to flight.

9. And Amaziah said to the man  of God, And what shall I do with the hundred talents which I gave to the force of Israel? And [4said 1the 2man  3of God], It is with the lord to give to you more of these.

10. And Amaziah parted the force  coming to him from Ephraim, to go forth to  their place. And they were enraged in their anger exceedingly over Judah, and returned to  their places in an anger of rage. 

11.  Amaziah Strikes Seir And Amaziah grew strong, and took to himself  his people, and went into the valley  of salts, and struck there the sons of Seir -- ten thousand.

12. And [5ten 6thousand 4took alive 1the 2sons 3of Judah], and they brought them upon the tip of the precipice, and flung them from the tip of the precipice, and all were torn to pieces.

13. And the sons of the force, whom Amaziah returned so as to not go with him to war, assailed against the cities of Judah from Samaria and unto Beth-horon. And they struck among them three thousand, and despoiled [2spoils 1many].

14. And it came to pass after the coming of Amaziah, having struck the Edomite, that he brought to them the gods of the sons of Seir, and he set them up to himself as gods; and [2before 3them 1he did obeisance], and sacrificed to them.

15. And [3came 1the anger 2of the lord] against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, and he said to him, Why did you seek the gods of the people, the ones which did not rescue  their own people from your hand?

16. And it came to pass in the speaking to him by him, that he said to him, Have [3counselor 4of the 5king 1I appointed 2you]? Take heed to it! that they should not strike you. And [3kept silent 1the 2prophet], and said, I know that [2consulted 1the lord]  to utterly destroy you, for he did this, and you did not heed  my advice.

17. And [4consulted 1Amaziah 2king 3of Judah], and sent to Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, for we should see each other's faces.

18. And [4sent 1Joash 2king 3of Israel] to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush  in  Lebanon sent to the cedar  in  Lebanon, saying, Give  your daughter to my son for a wife; but, behold, [7shall come 1the 2wild beasts 3of the 4field  5in  6Lebanon], and [3came 1the 2wild beasts], and they trampled the thorn-bush.

19. You said, Behold, I struck  Edom; and [5lifts you up  3heart 1your  2heavy]. Now be seated in your house, for why do you unite in evil, and you shall fall, and Judah with you?

20. But [2hearkened not 1Amaziah], for by the lord it was  to deliver him into the hands of Joash, for he inquired of the gods of the Edomites.

21. And [5ascended 1Joash 2the 3king 4of Israel]. And they saw one another, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in Beth-shemesh, which is  of Judah.

22. And Judah was put to flight before the face of Israel; and [2fled 1each] unto  his tent. 

23.  War between Israel and Judah And  Amaziah king of Judah was overtaken by Joash king of Israel in Beth-shemesh, and he brought him to Jerusalem, and he tore down from of the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim unto the gate of the corner -- four hundred cubits.

24. And all the gold, and the silver, and all the items  being found in the house of the lord, and the things with  Obed Edom, and the treasures of the house of the king, and of the things of the sons of the alliances he took, and he returned to Samaria.

25. And [7lived 1Amaziah 2the 3son of 4Joash 5king 6of Judah] after the dying of Joash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel [2years 1for fifteen].

26. And the rest of the words of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold are they not written upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel?

27. And at the time when Amaziah departed from the lord,  they made an attempt against him in a conspiracy in Jerusalem, and he fled unto Lachish; but they sent after him unto Lachish, and they killed him there.

28. And they took him upon the horses, and entombed him with  his fathers in the city of David.

8. And [3gave 1the 2Mehunim] gifts  to Uzziah. And [2was  1his name] famous unto the entrance of Egypt, for he strengthened himself even higher.

9. And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, both at the gate of the corner, and at the gate of the ravine, and at the corners; and he strengthened them.

10. And he built towers in the wilderness, and quarried [2wells 1many]; for [2cattle 1much] existed to him in Sephela and in the plain -- farmers and vine dressers in the mountains and in  Carmel; for he was fond of husbandry.

11. And there existed  to Uzziah a force to make war, and for going forth into battle array. And the count of the numbering of them was through the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maaseiah the judge, and through the hand of Hananiah, the substitute for the king.

13. And with them a force for warfare -- three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred. These are the ones preparing for war in a force of strength, to help the king over the opponents.

14. And [2made preparations 3for them 1Uzziah], giving to all the force shields, and spears, and helmets, and chest plates, and bows, and slings for stones.

15. And he made in Jerusalem machines being constructed for devices  to be upon the towers, and upon the corners,  to throw arrows and [2stones 1great]. And [3was heard about  2apparatus 1their] unto a distance, for he was wonderfully  helped until of which time he grew strong. 

16.  King Uzziah's Leprosy And as he grew strong [2was raised up  1his heart]  to corrupt. And he transgressed against the lord  his God, and he entered into the temple of the lord  to burn incense upon the altar of the of incenses.

17. And [4entered 5after 6him 1Azariah 2the 3priest], and with him eighty priests of the lord -- sons of power.

18. And they stood by against Uzziah the king, and they said to him, It is not for you, Uzziah,  to burn incense to the lord, but only to the priests, to the sons of Aaron, to the ones having been sanctified  to burn incense. Go forth from the sanctuary! for you departed from the lord, for [2will not 3be 4to you 1this] for glory from the lord  God.

19. And Uzziah was enraged. And in  his hand was the incense pan  to burn incense in the temple. And in  his being enraged against the priests, that  leprosy rose on  his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord upon the altar of the incenses.

20. And [5turned 6unto 7him 1Azariah 2the 4priest  3foremost], and the priests, and behold, he was leprous in the forehead. And they hastened him from there, for even he himself hastened to come forth, for [3reproved 4him 1the 2 lord].

21. And Uzziah the king was leprous until the day  of his decease. And [2in 3a house 4for the sick 1he settled], being leprous, for he was severed from the house of the lord. And Jotham  his son was over  his kingdom, to judge the people of the land.

22. And the rest of the words of Uzziah, the first and the last, are written by Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet.

23. And Uzziah slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him with  his fathers in the field of the burial place of the kings, for they said, He is leprous. And [3reigned 1Jotham 2his son] instead of him.

3. He built the gate of the house of the lord, the high one. And in the wall  of Ophel he built much.

4. And [2cities 1he built] in the mountains of Judah; and in the forests he built palaces and towers.

And he said to them, Behold, the anger of the lord the God  of your fathers is upon Judah, and he delivered them into  your hands.

11. And now hear me and return the captivity which you captured from  your brethren! for the anger of the rage of the lord is upon you.

12. And [6rose up 1the rulers 2of 3the 4sons 5of Ephraim] (Azariah the son of Johanan, and Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai) unto the ones coming from the war.

13. And they said to them, In no way should you bring the captivity here to us, for in  trespassing [3against the 4 lord 5upon 6us 1you 2speak] to add upon  our sins, and upon  our ignorance, for [2is great  1our sin], and the anger of the rage of the lord is upon  Israel.

21. And Ahaz took the things in the house of the lord, and the things in the house of the king, and of the rulers, and gave to the king of Assyria; but [2not 3for 4a help 5to him 1he was],

22. but only  to afflict him. And he proceeded  to leave from the lord, and [3said  1king 2Ahaz],

23. I will inquire of the gods of Damascus, the ones beating me. And he said, Because the gods of the king of Syria strengthens them, therefore I shall sacrifice to them, and they will assist me. And they became to him as an impediment, and to all Israel.

24. And Ahaz removed the items of the house of the lord, and he cut them in pieces, and locked the doors of the house of the lord. And he made for himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem,

25. and in every city; and in a city of Judah he made high places  to burn incense to alien gods. And he provoked to anger the lord  God  of his fathers.

26. And the rest of his words, and  his actions, the first and last, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.

27. And Ahaz slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him in the city of David; for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And [3reigned 1Hezekiah 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Chronicles 29

1.  Hezekiah Reigns in Judah [2was a son 3being 4twenty 5and 6five 7years old 1Hezekiah] in  his taking reign, and twenty nine years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name to his mother was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah.

2. And he did the upright thing before the lord according to all as much as [3did 1David  2his father].

3. And it came to pass as he was established over  his kingdom, in the [2month  1first], he opened the doors of the house of the lord, and he repaired them.

4. And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and he stood them in the side, the one towards the east.

5. And he said to them, Hear me, O Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the lord the God  of your fathers, and cast out the uncleanness from the holies!

6. For [2revolted  1our fathers], and they did the evil thing before the lord  our God; and they abandoned him, and turned  their face from the tent of the lord; and they gave him the back of the neck.

7. And they locked the doors of the temple, and they extinguished the lamps, and [3incense 1they did not 2burn], and the whole burnt-offerings they did not offer in the holy place to the God of Israel.

8. And [2was provoked 3to anger 1the lord] over  Judah and  Jerusalem. And he appointed them for an astonishment, and for extinction, and for a hissing, as you see with your eyes.

9. And behold, [2fell  1our fathers] by the sword, and  our sons, and  our daughters, and  our wives went into captivity in a land not of their own. 

10.  Judah Ordains a Covenant with The LORD Because of this it became upon my heart  to ordain a covenant to the lord God of Israel, and he shall turn from us the anger  of his rage.

11. And now, you should not stop to act, for by you the lord has taken you up  to stand before him to officiate to him, and to be his ministers, and ones burning incense.

12. And [3rose up 1the 2Levites], Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of Kohath; and from the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel; and from the sons of Gershon -- Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;

13. and of the sons of Elizaphan -- Shimri and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph -- Zechariah and Mattaniah;

14. and of the sons of Heman -- Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun -- Shemaiah and Uzziel.

15. And they gathered  their brethren, and purified themselves according to the commandment of the king, by order of the lord,  to cleanse the house of the lord.

16. And [3entered 1the 2priests] inside, into the house of the lord to purify it, and they cast out all the uncleanness  they found in the house of the lord in the courtyard of the house of the lord. And [3received 1the 2Levites]  to bring it forth unto the rushing stream Kidron outside.

17. And they began on day one of the [2month  1first]  to sanctify, and on the [2day  1eighth] of the month they entered into the temple of the lord; and they sanctified the house of the lord in [2days 1eight], and on the [2day  1sixteenth] of the [2month  1first] they completed.

18. And they entered inside to Hezekiah the king. And they said, We purified all the things in the house of the lord, and the altar of the whole burnt-offering, and  its utensils, and the table of the place setting, and all  its utensils.

19. And all the utensils which [3defiled  1king 2Ahaz] during  his kingdom, in  his defection, we prepared and sanctified. And behold, it is before the altar of the lord.

20. And [4rose early 1Hezekiah 2the 3king], and he brought together the rulers of the city. And he ascended into the house of the lord.

21. And he led up seven calves, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven winter yearlings of goats for a sin offering, for the kingdom, and for the holy things, and for Judah. And he told the sons of Aaron the priests,  to offer unto the altar of the lord.

22. And they sacrificed the calves, and [3took 1the 2priests] the blood, and poured upon the altar. And they sacrificed the rams, and poured upon the altar the blood. And they sacrificed the lambs, and they poured the blood upon the altar.

23. And they brought the winter yearlings of the ones for a sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they placed  their hands upon them.

24. And [3sacrificed 4them 1the 2priests], and atoned  of their blood against the altar, and they atoned for all Israel; for [3said 1the 2king], for all Israel is the whole burnt-offering, and the ones for a sin offering.

25. And he stationed the Levites in the house of the lord with cymbals, and with stringed instruments, and with lutes, according to the commandment of David the king, and Gad the seer to the king, and Nathan the prophet. For by the commandment of the lord the order was in the hand  of his prophets.

26. And [3stood 1the 2Levites] with instruments of David, and the priests with trumpets.

27. And Hezekiah spoke  to offer the whole burnt-offering upon the altar. And in the beginning of offering the whole burnt-offering, they began to sing to the lord, and the trumpets with the instruments of David the king of Israel.

28. And all the assembly did obeisance, and the psalm singers were singing, and the trumpets trumpeting, until of which time [3was completed 1the 2whole burnt-offering].

29. And as they completed offering, [3bent 1the 2king], and all the ones being found with him, and they did obeisance.

30. And [7spoke 1Hezekiah 2the 3king 4and 5the 6rulers] to the Levites for them to praise the lord by the words of David, and of Asaph the prophet. And they sang praise with gladness, and they fell and did obeisance.

31. And Hezekiah answered and said, Now you filled  your hands to the lord, come forward and bring sacrifices of praise into the house of the lord! And [3brought 1the 2assembly] sacrifices and praise into the house of the lord, and all eager in heart brought whole burnt-offerings.

32. And [9was 1the 2number 3of the 4whole burnt-offerings 5which 8offered 6the 7assembly] -- [2calves 1seventy], [2rams 1a hundred], [2lambs 1two hundred]; [3for 4a whole burnt-offering 5to the lord 1all 2these].

33. And the ones having been sanctified -- [2calves 1six hundred], [2sheep 1three thousand].

34. But the priests were few, and not able to flay the whole burnt-offering; and assisting them were the Levites, until of which time [3was completed 1the 2work], and until of which time [3sanctified themselves 1the 2other priests]; for the Levites more eagerly sanctified themselves than the priests.

35. And the whole burnt-offering was abundant with the fats of the one consecrated of the deliverance offering, and the libations of the whole burnt-offering. And [6was set up 1the 2work 3in 4the house 5of the lord].

36. And [6were glad 1Hezekiah 2and 3all 4the 5people], because  God prepared the people; for [4suddenly 3happened 1the 2matter].  

## 2 Chronicles 30

1.  Hezekiah Observes the Passover And Hezekiah sent unto all Israel and Judah, and [2letters 1he wrote] unto  Ephraim and Manasseh to come into the house of the lord in Jerusalem,  to observe the passover to the lord God of Israel.

2. And [3planned 1the 2king], and the rulers, and all the assembly in Jerusalem to observe the passover in the [2month  1second],

3. [3not 1for 2they were] able to observe it in  that time, for the priests were not sanctified enough, and the people were not gathered in Jerusalem.

4. And [3was pleasing 1the 2matter] before the king, and before the assembly.

5. And they established a communication  to go through by proclamation in all Israel, from Beer-sheba unto Dan,  to come and to observe the passover to the lord God of Israel in Jerusalem. For the multitude did not do according to the scripture.

6. And [3went 1the ones 2running] with the letters from the king and from the rulers, into all Israel and Judah, according to the order of the king, saying,  Sons of Israel, return to the lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob! and he will return to the ones having escaped,  surviving from the hand of the king of Assyria.

7. And do not be as  your fathers and  your brethren! the ones who revolted from the lord God  of their fathers, and he delivered them into desolation, as you see.

8. And do not harden  your necks as  your fathers! Give glory to the lord  God, and enter into  his sanctuary! which he sanctified into the eon. And serve to the lord your God! and he will turn from you the rage  of his anger.

9. For in  your turning to the lord,  your brethren and  your children will be  shown compassions before all the ones taking them captive, and he will return them to  this land; for merciful and pitying is the lord  our God, and he will not turn  his face from us, if we should return to him.

10. And [3were 1the 2runners] traveling city by city in  mount Ephraim and Manasseh, and unto Zebulun. And they became as victims of ones ridiculing them and deriding them.

11. But men from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun felt shame, and they came unto Jerusalem.

12. And in Judah [3came 1the hand 2of God] to give them [2heart 1one] to come and to do according to the order of the king and of the rulers, by the word of the lord.

13. And [3gathered 4in 5Jerusalem 2people 1many]  to observe the holiday of the unleavened breads in the [2month  1second] -- [3assembly 2vast 1an exceedingly].

14. And they rose up and demolished the altars in Jerusalem; and all in which they burned incense to the lying idols they tore down and tossed into the rushing stream Kidron.

15. And they sacrificed the passover on the fourteenth of the [2month  1second]. And the priests and the Levites felt shame, and they sanctified themselves, and they offered whole burnt-offerings in the house of the lord.

16. And they stood at  their station according to  their responsibility, according to the commandment of Moses the man  of God. And the priests received the blood from out of the hand of the Levites.

17. For a multitude of the assembly was not purified. And the Levites were  to sacrifice the passover to all  not able to be purified to the lord.

18. For the vast part of the people from Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Issachar, and Zebulun, were not purified; but even they ate the passover not according to the scripture. And Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The lord, the good God atone for all!

19. [2the heart 1even straightening out] for them to inquire of the lord  God  of their fathers, even not purified as according to the purity of the holy things.

20. And the lord heeded  Hezekiah, and healed the people.

21. And [7observed 1the 2sons 3of Israel  4being found 5in 6Jerusalem] the holiday of the unleavened breads seven days with [2gladness 1great]. And they sang praise to the lord day by day, even the priests and the Levites with instruments of strength to the lord.

22. And Hezekiah spoke unto the heart of all of the Levites, and of the ones perceiving [2understanding 1with good] in the lord. And they completed the holiday of the unleavened breads in seven days, sacrificing a sacrifice of deliverance, and making acknowledgment to the lord  God  of their fathers.

23. And [4counseled 1all 2the 3assembly] to observe [2seven 3days 1another]. And they observed another seven days with gladness.

24. For Hezekiah the king of Judah dedicated to all the assembly a thousand calves, and seven thousand sheep. And the rulers dedicated for the people [2calves 1a thousand], and [3sheep 1ten 2thousand], and were sanctified of the priests in multitude.

25. And [5was glad 1all 2the 3assembly 4of Judah], and the priests, and the Levites, and all the assembly  coming from Israel, and the foreigners  coming from the land of Israel, and the ones dwelling Judah.

26. And there was [2gladness 1great] in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there was not such a holiday in Jerusalem.

27. And [5rose up 1the 2priests 3the 4Levites] and blessed the people, and [2was heeded  1their voice], and [2came  1their prayer] into  [2home  1his sacred] in the heaven.  

## 2 Chronicles 31

1.  The High Places Demolished And as [3were completed 1all 2these things], [3went forth 1all 2Israel], the ones being found in the cities of Judah, and they broke the monuments, and knocked down the sacred groves, and tore down the high places, and demolished the altars from all  Judea, and Benjamin, and from Ephraim, and from Manasseh, unto completion. And [3returned 1all 2Israel] each unto  his inheritance, and unto  their cities.

2. And Hezekiah ordered the daily rotations of the priests and of the Levites, and the daily rotations of each according to  his ministration, to the priests and to the Levites, for the whole burnt-offering, and for the sacrifice  of deliverance, and  to praise, and to acknowledge, and to officiate at the gates in the courtyards of the house of the lord.

3. And the portion of the king from  his possessions were appointed for the whole burnt-offerings -- the early morning and the dusk, and for the whole burnt-offerings of the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the holidays, the ones being written in the law of the lord.

4. And he spoke to the people, to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, so that they should grow strong in the ministry of the house of the lord.

5. And as he assigned the word, [4were superabundant 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in first-fruit of grain, and wine, and olive oil, and honey, and every offspring of the field. And [7a tenth 8of all 9in 10multitude 6brought 1the 2sons 3of Israel 4and 5Judah].

6. And the ones dwelling in the cities of Judah also themselves brought a tenth of the calves, and sheep, and a tenth of the goats. And they sanctified to the lord their God. And they carried in and put heaps upon heaps.

7. In the [2month  1third] [3began 1the 2heaps] to be founded; and in the [2month  1seventh] they were completed.

8. And [5came 1Hezekiah 2and 3the 4rulers] and saw the heaps, and they blessed the lord, and  his people Israel.

9. And Hezekiah inquired of the priests and of the Levites concerning the heaps.

10. And [9spoke 10to 11him 1Azariah 2the 3priest 4the 5ruler 6of the 7house 8of Zadok], and he said, From of which time [3began 1the 2first-fruit] to be brought into the house of the lord, we ate and drank, and we left behind unto in abundance. For the lord blessed  his people, and we left behind still  this multitude.

11. And Hezekiah spoke to prepare cubicles in the house of the lord; and they prepared.

12. And they carried in there the first-fruits, and the tenth parts in trust. And over them for supervisor was Cononiah the Levite, and Shimei  his brother relieving,

13. and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah being placed by Cononiah and Shimei  his brother, as [4assigned 1Hezekiah 2the 3king], and Azariah the leader of the house of the lord.

14. And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper according to the east, was over the gifts, to give the first-fruits of the lord, and the holy things of the holies,

15. through the hand of Eden and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, and Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities through the hand of the priests in trust, to give to their brethren according to the daily rotations, according to the great and the small;

16. outside of the genealogy of the males from three years and up, to all  entering into the house of the lord, for a reckoning of days in its day, for ministration of daily rotation of their arrangement.

17. This is the distribution of the priests according to the houses of their families; and the Levites in  their daily rotations from twenty years and up, in arrangement,

18. in classification, in all genealogy of their sons, and their daughters, in the entire multitude, (for in trust they sanctified the holy,)

19. and to the sons of Aaron, to the ones officiating as priests in the country areas, and in  their cities, in every city, and a city where men who were named by name to give a portion to every male among the priests, and to every one being counted among the Levites.

20. And [3did 1thus 2Hezekiah] in all Judah, and he did the good and the upright, and the true before the lord  his God.

21. And in every work in which he began in the work in the house of the lord, and in the law, and in the orders, he sought after  his God from [2entire 3soul 1his]. And he acted, and his way prospered.  

## 2 Chronicles 32

1.  Sennacherib Wars against Judah And after  these words, and  this truth, came Sennacherib king of the Assyrians. And he came unto Judah, and he camped about the [2cities  1walled], and he spoke at first to take them.

2. And Hezekiah beheld that Sennacherib comes, and  his face  was to wage war against Jerusalem.

3. And he consulted with  his elders, and the mighty ones to obstruct the waters of the springs which was outside the city, and they vigorously assisted him.

4. And he brought together [2people 1many], and they obstructed the waters of the springs, and the rushing stream  separating through the city, saying, Should [3come 1the king 2of the Assyrians] and find [2water 1much], and grow strong?

5. And Hezekiah strengthened himself, and built up every  wall  having been razed, and towers, and [2outside 3wall around 1another]. And he strengthened the elevation of the city of David, and carefully prepared [2weapons 1many].

6. And he put rulers of war over the people. And they were brought together to him upon the square of the gate of the city. And he spoke unto  their heart, saying,

7. Be strong and be manly! fear not, nor be terrified from the face of the king of Assyria, nor from the face of any of the nations  with him! for with us are more over the ones with him.

8. With him are arms of flesh, [2with 3us 1but] is the lord  our God,  to deliver and  to wage  our war. And [3relied with confidence 1the 2people] upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

9. And after these things [4sent 1Sennacherib 2king 3of the Assyrians]  his servants unto Jerusalem. And he was by Lachish, and all  his military with him. And he sent to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah  in Jerusalem, saying,

10. Thus says Sennacherib king of the Assyrians, Upon whom do you rely, that you settle in the stronghold in Jerusalem?

11. Has not Hezekiah deceived you  to deliver you into death, and into hunger, and into thirst, saying, The lord  our God shall deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?

12. [3not 2this 1Is] Hezekiah who removed  his altars, and  his high places, and said to Judah, and to the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, saying, Before  this altar you shall do obeisance, and upon it you shall burn incense?

13. Do you not know what [4did 1I 2and  3my fathers] to all the peoples of the places. In being able, were [8able 1the 2gods 3of the 4nations 5of all 6the 7earth] to deliver  their people from my hand?

14. Who among all the gods  of these nations, which [2utterly destroyed  1my fathers], is the one who is able to rescue  his people from my hand, that [2shall be able  1your God] to deliver you from out of my hand?

15. And now, let not [2deceive 3you 1Hezekiah], and not persuade you to do according to these things, and do not trust him; for in no way was [6able 1a god 2of any 3nation 4and 5kingdom]  to deliver  his people from out of my hand, and from out of the hand  of my fathers. For  [3your God 1in no way 2shall] deliver you from out of my hand.

16. And still [2spoke  1his servants] against the lord  God, and against Hezekiah his servant.

17. And [2a scroll 1he wrote]  to berate the lord  God of Israel. And he said concerning him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the earth did not rescue  their people from my hand, so in no way shall [4rescue 1the 2God 3of Hezekiah]  his people from out of my hand.

18. And they yelled with [2voice 1a great] in Jewish unto the people of Jerusalem  upon the wall,  to make them afraid of them, and  to tear them down, so as to first take the city.

19. And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as also against the gods of the peoples of the land -- the works of the hands of men.

20. And [4prayed 1Hezekiah 2the 3king], and Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet concerning these things, and they yelled unto the heaven.

21. And the lord sent an angel, and he obliterated every mighty warrior, and ruler, and commandant in the camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shame of face into  his land. And he entered into the house  of his god, and some of the ones coming forth from his belly overthrew him by the broadsword.

22. And the lord delivered  Hezekiah and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria, and from the hand of all, and rested them round about.

23. And many brought gifts to the lord in Jerusalem, and presents  to Hezekiah king of Judah. And he was elevated in the eyes of all the nations after these things.

24. In  those days Hezekiah became ill unto death, and he prayed to the lord. And he heeded him, and [3a sign 1gave 2to him].

25. And [2rendered not 3according to 4the 5recompense 6which 7he recompensed 8to him 1Hezekiah]; but he exalted  his heart. And [2came 3upon 4him 1wrath], and upon Judah, and Jerusalem.

26. And Hezekiah was humbled from the haughtiness  of his heart, he and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem. And [3did not 4come 5upon 6them 1the wrath 2of the lord] in the days of Hezekiah.

27. And there came to Hezekiah riches and glory -- [2much 1exceedingly]. And [3treasuries 1he made 2himself] of silver, and of gold, and [2stone 1of valuable], and for  aromatics; and [2armories 1he made], and [2for all 3the 4items 5of the 6desirable things 1storehouses];

28. and cities for the produce of the grain, and wine, and olive oil; and stables for every beast, and havens for the flocks.

29. And [2cities 1he made] for himself, and possessions of sheep and oxen in abundance; for [2gave 3to him 1the lord 6belongings 5vast 4exceedingly].

30. Hezekiah himself obstructed the delivery of the water of Gihon -- the upper part, and he straightened it below to the west of the city of David. And the way of Hezekiah was prospered in all  his works.

31. And thus in the matters concerning the ambassadors of the rulers of the ones from Babylon  being sent to him, to inquire of him of the miracle which took place in the land, that [2abandoned 3him 1the lord],  to test him, to know the things in  his heart.

32. And the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and  his mercies, behold, they are written in the prophecy of Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, and upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.

33. And Hezekiah slept with  his fathers. And they entombed him in the ascent of the burying-places of the sons of David. And glory and honor they gave to him in  his death, even all Judah, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem. And [3reigned 1Manasseh 2his son] instead of him.  

## 2 Chronicles 33

1.  Manasseh Reigns in Judah [2was a son 3being 4twelve 5years old 1Manasseh] in  his taking reign, and fifty-five years he reigned in Jerusalem.

2. And he acted  wickedly before the lord according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord removed from in front of the sons of Israel.

3. And he returned and built the high places which [3tore down 1Hezekiah  2his father]. And he set up altars to the Baals, and he made sacred groves, and he did obeisance to all the military of the heaven, and he served to them.

4. And he built altars in the house of the lord, in which the lord said, [3in 4Jerusalem 2will be  1My name] into the eon.

5. And he built altars to all the military of the heaven in the two courtyards of the house of the lord.

6. And he led  his children in fire in the ground of the Son of Hinnom. And he prognosticated, and foretold, and administered potions, and established ones who deliver oracles, and enchanters. And he multiplied  to act  wickedly before the lord,  to provoke him to anger.

7. And he put the carved and the molten image, which he made, in the house of God, in which God said to David and to Solomon  his son, In  this house, and in Jerusalem, which I chose from out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put  my name there into the eon;

8. and I shall not proceed  to shake the foot of Israel from the land of which I gave to their fathers, if only they guard  to do all things which I gave charge to them, according to all the law, and the orders, and the judgments given by the hand of Moses.

9. And Manasseh misled  Judah and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem,  to act  wickedly above all the nations which the lord removed from in front of the sons of Israel.

10. And the lord spoke with Manasseh, and unto  his people, and they did not listen. 

11.  Manasseh Led unto Babylon in Bonds And the lord led upon them the rulers of the force of the king of Assyria. And they overtook  Manasseh in bonds, and they tied him in shackles, and they led him into Babylon.

12. And as he was afflicted, he sought the face of the lord  his God, and was humbled exceedingly from in front of the God of his fathers.

13. And he prayed to him, and he heeded him, and he heeded  his yelling, and he returned him unto Jerusalem over  his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that the lord -- he is  God.

14. And after these things, he built a wall outside the city of David, from the southwest  of Gihon, by the rushing stream going forth by the [2gate  1fishing] -- a circuit to the Ophel, and he raised it high exceedingly. And he placed rulers of the force in all the [2cities  1walled] in Judah.

15. And he removed the gods of the aliens, and the carved image from out of the house of the lord, and all the altars which he built on the mountain of the house of the lord, and in Jerusalem; and he cast them outside the city.

16. And he set up the altar of the lord, and he sacrificed upon it a sacrifice of deliverance offering and a praise offering, and he told  Judah  to serve to the lord, to the God of Israel.

17. Only still the people [2upon 3the 4high places 1sacrificed], except to the lord their God.

18. And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and  his prayer  to  God, and the words of the seers, of the ones speaking to him in the name of the lord  God of Israel, behold, they are upon the words of the kings of Israel.

19. And  his prayer, and as God heeded him, and all  his sins, and  his defections, and the places upon which he built on them the high places, and established there sacred groves, and carved images, before  he returned, behold, they are written by the words of the seers. 

20.  Amon Reigns in Judah And Manasseh slept with  his fathers, and they entombed him in the garden of his house. And [3reigned 1Amon 2his son] instead of him.

21. [2was a son 3being 4twenty 5and 6two 7years old 1Amon] in  his taking reign, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem.

22. And he did the wicked thing before the lord as did Manasseh  his father. And to all the idols which [3made 1Manasseh  2his father], Amon sacrificed and served to them.

23. And he was not humbled before the lord as [3was humbled 1Manasseh  2his father]; for his son Amon multiplied in trespassing.

24. And [2attacked 3him  1his servants], and struck him in his house.

25. But [5struck 1the 2people 3of the 4land] the ones attacking against  king Amon. And [5gave reign to 1the 2people 3of the 4land]  Josiah his son instead of him.  

## 2 Chronicles 34

1.  Josiah Reigns in Judah [2was a son 3being 4eight 5years old 1Josiah] in  his taking reign, and thirty and one year he reigned in Jerusalem.

2. And he did the upright thing before the lord, and he went in the ways of David  his father, and he did not turn aside right nor left.

3. And in the eighth year  of his kingdom (and he was still a boy) he began  to seek the lord  God of David  his father. And in the twelfth year  of his kingdom he began  to cleanse Judah and  Jerusalem of the high places, and of the sacred groves, and of the shrines, and of the carved images, and of the molten images.

4. And he razed the things before his face -- altars, the ones to the Baals; and the high places, the ones above them. And he cut down the sacred groves, and the carved images. And the molten images he broke and ground fine, and tossed their dust upon the face of the tombs of the ones sacrificing to them.

5. And the bones of the priests he incinerated upon  their altars, and he cleansed  Judah and  Jerusalem,

6. and among the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, and Naphtali, and the places round about them.

7. And he tore down the altars, and the sacred groves; and the idols he cut in fine pieces, and all the high places he cut in pieces from all the land of Israel, and he returned to Jerusalem.

8. And in the eighteenth year  of his kingdom, when he urged  [6to be cleansed 1the 2land 3and 4the 5house], he sent  Shaphan son of Azaliah, and  Maaseiah ruler of the city, and  Joah son of Joahaz the recorder,  to fortify the house of the lord  his God.

9. And they came to Helkiah the [2priest  1great], and they gave the money that was carried into the house of God, which [6gathered 1the 2Levites  3guarding 4the 5gate] by the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of the rulers, and of all the rest in Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the ones living in Jerusalem.

10. And they put it into the hand of the ones doing the works, of the ones placed in the house of the lord. And they gave it to the ones doing the works in the house of the lord  to repair and to strengthen the house.

11. And they gave it to the fabricators and to the builders to buy [2stones 1quadrangular], and wood for beams to roof the houses which [3utterly destroyed 1the kings 2of Judah].

12. And the men were doing in trust the things over the works. And over them overseers were established -- Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of Kohath -- to oversee; and all other Levites, and all perceiving to play with instruments of odes,

13. and over the load carriers, and knowers concerning all of the ones doing the works in effort; and others of the Levites -- scribes and judges and gatekeepers. 

14.  Helkiah Finds a Scroll of the Law And in  their bringing forth the money  coming in as income into the house of the lord, [4found 1Helkiah 2the 3priest] the scroll of the law of the lord, the one by the hand of Moses.

15. And Helkiah responded and said to Shaphan the scribe, [2the scroll 3of the law 1I found] in the house of the lord. And Helkiah gave the scroll  to Shaphan.

16. And Shaphan carried the scroll to the king, and he gave yet to the king a word, saying, All the money was rendered into the hand  of your servants of the ones doing the work.

17. And they cast in a furnace the silver  found in the house of the lord, and they put it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the ones doing the work.

18. And [4reported 1Shaphan 2the 3scribe] to the king, saying, [5a scroll 4gave 6to me 1Helkiah 2the 3priest]. And [2read 3it 1Shaphan] before the king.

19. And it came to pass as [3heard 1the 2king] the words of the law, that he tore  his garments.

20. And [3gave charge 1the 2king] to Helkiah, and  to Ahikam son of Shaphan, and  to Abdon son of Micah, and to Shaphan the scribe, and to Asaiah servant of the king, saying,

21. Go, seek the lord for me, and for all the ones left in Israel and Judah, concerning the words of the scroll of the one being found! for great is the rage of the lord which burns away against us, because [2did not 3listen  1our fathers] concerning the word of the lord,  to do according to all the things being written in  this scroll. 

22.  Huldah Prophesies Calamity And Helkiah went, and the ones who told the king, to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum, son of Tikvath, son of Hazrah the keeper of the cloaks; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second section. And they spoke to her according to these things.

23. And she said to them, Thus said the lord  God of Israel, Say to the man, to the one sending you to me,

24. Thus says the lord, Behold, I bring evils upon  this place, and upon the ones dwelling in it, of all the words  being written in the scroll  being read before the king of Judah.

25. Because they abandoned me, and burnt incense [2gods 1to alien], that they should provoke me to anger by all the works  of their hands. And [2was burned  1my rage] against  this place, and it will not be extinguished.

26. And concerning the king of Judah, the one sending you  to seek the lord, Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, Of the words which you heard,

27. and because [2feels shame  1your heart], and you humbled yourself in front of me in  your hearing  my words against  this place, and against the ones dwelling in it; and you were humbled before me, and tore  your garments, and wept before me; even I heard, says the lord.

28. Behold, I add you to  your fathers, and you shall be added to  your grave in peace. And [2shall not see  1your eyes] all the evils which I bring upon  this place, and upon the ones dwelling it. And they brought back [2to the 3king 1the word].

29. And [3sent 1the 2king] and brought together the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

30. And [3ascended 1the 2king] into the house of the lord, and all Judah, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people from small unto great. And he read in their ears all the words of the scroll of the covenant  being found in the house of the lord.

31. And [3stood 1the 2king] upon the column, and he ordained a covenant before the lord,  to go before the lord,  to guard  his commandments, and  his testimonies, and  his orders, with the entire heart, and with the entire soul, so as to observe the words of the covenant  having been written upon  this scroll.

32. And he established all the ones being found in Jerusalem, and in Judah, and Benjamin. And [5did 1the 2ones dwelling 3in 4Jerusalem] according to the covenant of the lord God of their fathers.

33. And Josiah removed all the abominations from out of all the land, which was of the sons of Israel. And he made all the ones being found in Jerusalem and in Israel  serve to the lord  their God all  his days. He did not turn aside from following after the lord  God  of his fathers.  

## 2 Chronicles 35

1.  Josiah Observes the Passover And Josiah observed the passover in Jerusalem to the lord his God. And he sacrificed the passover on the fourteenth of the [2month  1first].

2. And he stationed the priests at  their watches, and he strengthened them for the works of the house of the lord.

3. And he spoke to the Levites, to the mighty ones in all Israel,  to sanctify themselves to the lord, and  to put the [2ark  1holy] in the house of the lord. And they put the [2ark  1holy] in the house which [7built 1Solomon 2son 3of David 4the 5king 6of Israel]. And [3said 1the 2king], It is not for you to lift [2upon 3your shoulders 1anything]. Now then, you officiate to the lord  your God, and to his people Israel!

4. And be prepared according to the houses of your families, and according to  your daily rotations, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and by the hand of Solomon his son!

5. And stand in the house according to the divisions of the houses of your families,  of your brethren, the sons of the people, and the portion of the house of the family to the Levites!

6. And sacrifice the passover, and [2the 3holy things 1prepare] for your brethren!  to observe according to the word of the lord  by the hand of Moses.

7. And Josiah dedicated for the sons of the people -- sheep, and lambs, and kids from the sons of the goats, all for the passover, to everyone  being found -- in number thirty thousand, and [3calves 1three 2thousand]. These were of the substance of the king.

8. And  his rulers dedicated to the people, and to the priests, and to the Levites; and Helkiah and Zechariah and Jeiel the rulers of the house  of God gave to the priests for the passover -- sheeps and lambs and kids -- two thousand and six hundred, and [2calves 1three hundred].

9. And Conaniah, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel his brother, and Hashabiah, and Jehiel, and Jozabad, rulers of the Levites, dedicated to the Levites for the passover -- [2sheep 1five thousand], and [2calves 1five hundred].

10. And [3was set up 1the 2ministration], and [3stood 1the 2priests] at  their station, and the Levites in  their divisions, according to the commandment of the king.

11. And they sacrificed the passover. And [3poured 1the 2priests] the blood from out of their hand, and the Levites flayed.

12. And they prepared the whole burnt-offering, to deliver them according to the division, according to the houses of the families to the sons of the people,  to offer to the lord, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so it was into the morning.

13. And they roasted the passover in fire according to the ordinance. And the holy pieces they boiled in the brass cauldrons, and in the kettles. And the way prospered, and they ran it to all the sons of the people.

14. And after this they prepared for themselves, and for the priests (for the priests, the sons of Aaron, in offering of the whole burnt-offerings and of the fat,) until night. And the Levites prepared for themselves, and for their brethren the sons of Aaron.

15. And the psalm singers, the sons of Asaph were at  their station, according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun of the prophets of the king; and the rulers, and the gatekeepers, were stationed gate by gate; it was not for them to move from  their ministration, for  their brethren the Levites prepared for them.

16. And [5was set up 1all 2the 3ministration 4of the lord] in  that day,  to observe the passover, and to offer the whole burnt-offerings upon the altar of the lord, according to the command  of king Josiah.

17. And [5observed 1the 2sons 3of Israel  4being found present] the passover at  that time, and the holiday of the unleavened breads seven days.

18. And there was not a passover likened to it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; for all kings of Israel did not do the passover which Josiah did, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel, the ones being found, and the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, to the lord.

19. In the eighteenth year of the kingdom of Josiah [2was observed  1this passover].

20. And after all these things which Josiah prepared for the house, [5ascended up 1Pharaoh 2Necho 3king 4of Egypt] against the king of the Assyrians at the river Euphrates,  to wage war against him at Carchemish. And [3went 1king 2Josiah] to meet against him.

21. And he sent to him messengers, saying, What is it to me and to you, O king of Judah? [2not 3against 4you 1I come] today to make war, but only against the place  of my war; and  God told  me to hasten. You take heed of the God, of the one with me, lest he ruin you.

22. And [2did not 3turn 1Josiah]  his face from him, but he fortified himself  to wage war against him. And he did not hearken concerning the words of Pharaoh Necho by the mouth of God. And he came  to wage war in the plain of Megiddo. 

23.  Josiah Wounded in Battle And [3shot 1the 2bowmen] unto king Josiah. And [3said 1the 2king] to his servants, Lead me out! for I am in pain exceedingly.

24. And [2led 3him  1his servants] from the chariot, and hauled him upon the [2chariot  1second] which was his; and they led him to Jerusalem, and he died, and he was entombed with  his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned over Josiah.

25. And Jeremiah lamented over Josiah. And [7spoke 1all 2the 3rulers 4and 5the 6ones in control] a lamentation over Josiah spoken until  today. And they appointed it as an order unto Israel, and behold, it is written in the lamentations.

26. And [7were 1the 2rest 3of the words 4of Josiah 5and  6his hope] being written in the law of the lord.

27. And  his words, the first and the last, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah.  

## 2 Chronicles 36

1.  Jehoahaz Reigns in Judah And [5took 1the 2people 3of the 4land]  Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and they anointed him, and placed him as king instead of  his father in Jerusalem.

2. [2was a son 3being 4twenty 5and 6three 7years old 1Jehoahaz] in  his taking reign, and three months he reigned in Jerusalem.

7. And part of the items of the house of the lord he carried away unto Babylon, and he put them in  his temple in Babylon. 

8.  Jehoiachin Reigns in Judah And the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and all which he did, behold, these are written in the scroll of the words of the days of the kings of Israel and of Judah. And [3reigned 1Jehoiachin 2his son] instead of him.

13. in the [2the things 3with  4king 5Nebuchadnezzar 1annulling], in which he bound him by an oath according to  God. And he hardened  his neck, and  [2his heart 1he strengthened]  to not return to the lord God of Israel.

14. And all the honorable men of Judah, and the priests, and the people of the land multiplied  to disregard good, to do wickedness according to the abominations of the nations; and they defiled the house of the lord  in Jerusalem.

15. And [4sent 1the lord  2God  3of their fathers] to them by the hand  of his prophets, ones rising up early, even sending  his messengers, for he was sparing  his people, and  his sanctuary.

16. And they were sneering at  his messengers, and treating with contempt  his words, and mocking among  his prophets, until [4ascended 1the 2rage 3of the lord] among  his people until there was no cure. 

17.  The Destruction of Jerusalem And he led against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he killed  their young men by the broadsword in the house of his sanctuary. And he did not spare the young men. And  their virgins he did not show mercy on, and  their elders he took away --  whole he delivered up into their hands.

18. And all the items of the house  of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the lord, and all the treasures of the king, and of the great men. The whole he carried unto Babylon.

19. And he burnt the house of the lord, and razed the wall of Jerusalem. And  its palaces he burnt by fire, and every [2item 1beautiful] he appointed for extinction.

20. And he resettled the remaining ones in Babylon. And they were for him and  his sons for manservants until the kingdom of the Medes,

21.  to fulfill the word of the lord through the mouth of Jeremiah, until  [3favorably receives 1the 2land]  its Sabbaths; by observing the Sabbath all the days  of its desolation, to observe the Sabbath in the fulfillment [2years 1of seventy]. 

22.  The Proclamation of Cyrus [2year 1In the first] of Cyrus king of the Persians, after the fulfillment of the saying of the lord through the mouth of Jeremiah, the lord awakened the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians. And he exhorted to proclaim in all  his kingdom in writing, saying,

23. Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians, to all the kingdoms of the earth, [5gave 6to me 1The lord  2God 3of the 4heaven]; and he gave charge to me to build to him a house in Jerusalem  in  Judea. Who is there of you of all  his people? The lord  his God will be with him -- let him ascend!
