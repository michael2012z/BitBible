# Jonah

## Jonah 1

1.  Jonah Flees from God And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

2. Rise up, and go unto Nineveh the [2city  1great], and proclaim in it! for [4ascended 1the 2cry  3of its evils] to me.

3. And Jonah rose up  to flee into Tarshish from the face of the lord. And he went down into Joppa. And he found a boat proceeding to Tarshish, and he gave  his fare, and ascended into it  to sail with them unto Tarshish from the face of the lord.

4. And the lord raised up a wind upon the sea; and there became [2swell 1a great] in the sea, and the boat was exposed to danger  of breaking up.

5. And [3feared 1the 2mariners], and yelled out each to  his god. And [2an expulsion 1they made] of the items, of the ones in the boat, into the sea,  to lighten of them. But Jonah went down into the hold of the boat, and he went to sleep, and snored.

6. And [3drew near 4to 5him 1the 2captain], and said to him, Why do you snore? Rise up, call upon  your God! so that God should preserve us, and in no way we should be destroyed.

7. And [2said 1each] to  his neighbor, Come we should cast lots, and we shall know for what reason  this evil is to us. And they cast lots, and [3fell 1the 2lot] upon Jonah.

8. And they said to him, Report indeed! for what reason  [2this evil 1is] to us? What [2your  3work 1is], and from where have you come, and from out of what kind of place, and of what kind of people are you?

9. And he said to them, [2a servant 3of the lord 1I am], and [3the 4God 5of the 6heaven 1I 2worship] who made the sea and the dry land.

10. And [3feared 1the 2men 5fear 4a great], and they said to him, What is this you did? (because [3knew 1the 2men] that [3from 4the face 5of the lord 1he was 2fleeing], for he reported it to them.) 

11.  Jonah is Cast into the Sea And they said to him, What should we do to you, and [3abates 1the 2sea] from us? (for the sea went forth and rose up a rather great swell.)

12. And Jonah said to them, Lift me, and cast me into the sea, and [3shall abate 1the 2sea] from you! Because I know, that on account of me  [3swell  2great 1this 5upon 6you 4is].

13. And [3pressed on 1the 2men]  to turn towards the land, and they were not able, for the sea went, and it rose up rather upon them.

14. And they yelled out to the lord, and they said, By no means, O lord, should you destroy us because of the soul  of this man, and should not be imputed against us the blood of the just; for you, O lord, in which manner you want, you do.

15. And they took  Jonah, and they cast him into the sea. And [3stood 1the 2sea] from  its tossing about.

16. And [3feared 1the 2men 5fear 4a great] of the lord, and they sacrificed a sacrifice to the lord, and vowed the vows.

17. And the lord assigned [2whale 1a great] to swallow  Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights.  

## Jonah 2

1.  Jonah's Prayer And Jonah prayed to the lord  his God from out of the belly of the whale.

2. And he said, I yelled  my affliction to the lord  my God, and he hearkened to me. From out of the belly of Hades was my cry; you heard my voice.

3. You threw me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and rivers encircled me. All  your crests and  your waves [2upon 3me 1went].

4. And I said, Have I been thrust away from your eyes? Surely I shall proceed  to look towards [3temple  2holy 1your].

5. [2was poured about 3me 1Water] unto the soul. The deep encircled me to the extreme; [3went down  2head 1my].

6. Into the fissures of mountains I went down; into the earth of which  its bars [2holds 1are the eternal]. Yet let [2ascend 3from 4corruption  1my life], O lord  my God!

7. In the faltering [2from 3me  1of my soul]  I remembered the lord; and may [2come 3to 4you  1my prayer] in [3temple  2holy 1your].

8. The ones watching vanities and lies [2their mercy 1abandoned].

9. But I with the voice of praise and acknowledgment will sacrifice to you. As much as I vowed I will render to you. For my deliverance is by the lord.

10. And it was assigned from the lord to the whale; and it cast out  Jonah upon the dry land.  

## Jonah 3

1.  Jonah Sent to Nineveh And came to pass the word of the lord to Jonah the second time, saying,

2. Rise up, go unto Nineveh the [2city  1great]! and proclaim in it! according to the proclamation  [6before 1which 2I 3spoke 4to 5you].

3. And Jonah rose up, and went into Nineveh as the lord spoke. And Nineveh was [2city 1a great]  to God, as the goings of a journey of three days.

4. And Jonah began  to go into the city, as the going [2day 1of one]. And he proclaimed and said, Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be eradicated.

5. And [4believed 1the 2men 3of Nineveh]  in God, and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from their great unto their small. 

6.  Nineveh Repents And [3approached 1the 2word] to the king of Nineveh. And he rose up from  his throne, and he removed  his apparel from himself, and he wore sackcloth, and sat upon ashes.

7. And it was proclaimed and was spoken in  Nineveh by the king, and by  his great men, saying, The men, and the cattle, and the oxen, and the sheep -- let them not taste, nor feed, and [2water 1let them not drink]!

8. And [6put around 7sackcloths 1the 2men 3and 4the 5cattle]. And they yelled out to  God fervently. And [2turned 1each] from  [3way 1their  2wicked], and from the iniquity  in their hands, saying,

9. Who knows if [2shall change his mind  1God], and he shall turn from the anger of his rage, and in no way should we perish?

10. And God saw  their works, that they turned from  [3ways 1their  2wicked]; and God changed his mind over the evil which he spoke  to do to them; and he did not do it.  

## Jonah 4

1.  Jonah Grieved And Jonah was grieved [2distress 1with great], and was confounded.

2. And he prayed to the lord, and he said, O lord, Were not these  my words still being  in  my land? Because of this I thought beforehand  to flee unto Tarshish. Because I knew that you are merciful and pitying, lenient and full of mercy, and one to change his mind over the evils.

3. And now, master, O lord, take  my soul from me, for it is good  for me to die than live!

4. And the lord said, Are [2exceedingly 3grieved 1you]?

5. And Jonah went forth from out of the city, and he sat before the city, and he made for himself there a tent, and he sat down underneath it, unto of which he could look over what will be of the city. 

6.  The Gourd Shades Jonah And [3assigned 1the lord  2God] a gourd, and it ascended above the head of Jonah,  to be shading up above  his head,  to shade him from  his hurts. And Jonah rejoiced over the gourd [2joy 1with great].

7. And God assigned a worm for early morning the next day, and it struck the gourd, and it was dried up.

8. And it came to pass at the same time as the rising of the sun, and God assigned [2wind 1a burning] to burn; and [3struck 1the 2sun] upon the head of Jonah, and he became faint-hearted, and resigned  of his life, and said, Better for me  to die than live.

9. And [2said  1God] to Jonah, Are [2exceedingly 3grieved 1you] over the gourd? And he said, [2exceedingly 3grieved 1I am] unto death.

10. And the lord said, You indeed spared for the gourd, for which you suffered no hardship over it, nor nourished it; which came up during the night, and [2during 3the night 1perished].

11. But I, shall I not spare for Nineveh the [2city  1great], in which dwells in it more than twelve myriads of men, who do not know their right hand or their left, and [2cattle 1much]?
