# Exodus

## Exodus 1

1.  Israel Multiplies These are the names of the sons of Israel of the ones entering into Egypt together with Jacob  their father; each of them sojourning entered.

2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,

3. Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin,

4. Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

5. But Joseph was in Egypt. And were all the souls coming forth from Jacob -- five and seventy.

6. [3came to an end 1And 2Joseph], and all  his brothers, and all  that generation.

7. And the sons of Israel grew and multiplied, and [2extensive 1became], and grew strong exceedingly, exceedingly. [4multiplied 1And 2the 3land] of them.

8. [4rose up 1And 3king 2another] over Egypt who did not know  Joseph.

9. And he said to his nation, Behold, the race of the sons of Israel are a great multitude, and they are strong above us.

10. Come then we should deal subtly with them, lest at any time they should multiply, and whenever [3to us 2may come to pass 1a war], [2will add 1these also] to the opponents, and waging war against us they shall go forth from the land. 

11.  The Affliction of Israel And he set to them supervisors over the works, that they might afflict them in their works. And they built [2cities 1fortified] to Pharaoh --   Pithom and Raamses, and On which is Heliopolis.

12. And in so far as they humbled them by so much, [2many more 1they became]. And they were strong exceedingly, exceedingly. And [3were abhorred 1the 2Egyptians] of the sons of Israel.

13. And [3tyrannized 1the 2Egyptians] the sons of Israel by force.

14. And they grievously afflicted them by the life in the [2works  1hard] in the mortar, and in the making of bricks, and in all the works  in the plains, according to all the works which they were reducing them to slavery with force.

15. And [5said 1the 2king 3of the 4Egyptians] to the midwives of the Hebrews, to a certain one of them with the name Shiphrah, and the name of the second Puah.

16. And he said to them, Whenever you act as midwife to the Hebrews, and they should be about  to bear, if then it should be a male, you kill it! But if a female, preserve it!

17. [4feared 1But 2the 3midwives]  God, and they did not do in so far as [4ordered 5them 1the 2king 3of Egypt]. And they brought forth alive the males.

18. [5called 1And 2the 3king 4of Egypt] the midwives, and said to them, Why is it that you did  this thing, and brought forth alive the males?

19. [4said 1And 2the 3midwives]  to Pharaoh, Not as the women of Egypt are the Hebrews, for they give birth before  [3entered 4to 5them 1the 2midwives], and they bear.

20. [3good 1And 2God did] to the midwives. And he multiplied the people, and it became strong exceedingly.

21. Since [3feared 1the 2midwives]  God, they made to themselves families.

22. [3gave orders 1And 2Pharaoh] to all  his people, saying, Every male who ever should be born to the Hebrews [2into 3the 4river 1toss], and every female bring it forth alive!  

## Exodus 2

1.  Birth of Moses And there was a certain man from the tribe of Levi, and he took of the daughters of Levi, and had her.

2. And [2in 3the womb 1she conceived], and bore a male. And seeing that it was fair, they sheltered it [2months 1three].

3. But when they were not able [2it 3any longer 1to hide], [2took 3for him  1his mother] a wicker basket of papyrus, and besmeared it with tar, and put the male child into it, and put it into the marsh by the river.

4. And [2spied out  1his sister] far off to learn what  would result to him.

5. [5went down 1And 2the 3daughter 4of Pharaoh] to bathe upon the river, and  her handmaidens came near unto the river. And they saw the wicker basket in the marsh, and she sent the handmaiden to take it up.

6. And opening, she sees a male child weeping in the wicker basket. And [4spared 5him 1the 2daughter 3of Pharaoh], and said, [2from 3the 4male children 5of the 6Hebrews 1This one is].

7. And [2said  1his sister] to the daughter of Pharaoh, If you want I will call for you a woman nursing from the Hebrews, and she will suckle for you the male child.

8. And [4said 5to her 1the 2daughter 3of Pharaoh], Go! And going, the young woman called the mother of the male child.

9. [5said 1And 6to 7her 2the 3daughter 4of Pharaoh], Carefully keep for me  this male child, and suckle it for me, and I will give to you the wage. [4took 1And 2the 3woman] the male child, and suckled it.

10. [4maturing 1And 2the 3male child], she brought it to the daughter of Pharaoh. And he became to her for a son. And she named  his name Moses. Saying, For from the water I took him up. 

11.  Moses Kills an Egyptian And it came to pass in  [3days  2many 1those], [3older 2becoming 1Moses], he went forth to  his brethren of the sons of Israel. And contemplating  their misery, he saw an Egyptian man beating a certain Hebrew  of his own brethren of the sons of Israel.

12. And looking about here on this side and here on that side he did not see anyone. And striking the Egyptian, he hid him in the sand.

13. And coming forth the [2day  1second], he saw two men, Hebrews skirmishing. And he says to the one in the wrong, Why do you beat  your neighbor?

14.  And he said, Who placed you magistrate and judge over us? Is it that [3to do away with 4me 1you 2want] in which manner you did away yesterday with the Egyptian? [3feared 1And 2Moses], and said, Surely thus [3apparent 2has become  1this thing]. 

15.  Moses Flees to Midian [3heard about 1And 2Pharaoh]  this thing, and he sought to do away with Moses. [3withdrew 1But 2Moses] from the face of Pharaoh, and he dwelt in the land of Midian. And coming into the land of Midian, he sat at the well.

16. And to the priest of Midian there were seven daughters tending the sheep  of their father Jethro. And they came to draw water until they filled the troughs to water the sheep  of their father Jethro.

17. And coming, the shepherds cast them away. [3rose up 1But 2Moses] to rescue them, and he drew water for them, and he watered  their sheep.

18. And they came to Reuel  their father.  And he said to them, Why is it that you hastened  to come today?

19.  And they said, An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds, and he drew water for us, and he watered  our sheep.

20.  And he said to his daughters, And where is he, and why thus have you left the man? You call him indeed! that he may eat bread.

21. [3settled 1And 2Moses] by the man. And he handed over Zipporah  his daughter to Moses as wife.

22. [3in 4the womb 1And 2conceiving], the woman bore a son, and Moses named  his name Gershom, saying that, I am a sojourner in [2land 1an alien]. And still again conceiving, she bore [2son 1a second], and he called  his name Eliezer, saying that, the God  of my father, my helper, also rescued me from the hand of Pharaoh.

23. And after  [3days  2many 1those], [4came to an end 1the 2king 3of Egypt], and [4groaned 1the 2sons 3of Israel] from the works, and yelled out. And [2ascended  1their yell] to  God because of the works.

24. And God listened to  their moaning, and God remembered  his covenant, the one with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.

25. And God looked upon the sons of Israel, and he was made known to them.  

## Exodus 3

1.  Moses and the Burning Bush And Moses was tending the sheep of Jethro  his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the sheep by the wilderness. And he came unto the mountain  of God -- Horeb.

2. And appeared to him an angel of the lord in flaming fire from out of the bush. and he saw that the bush burned with fire, but the bush did not incinerate.

3. [3said 1And 2Moses], Going by I will see  [2vision  1this great]. Why is it that [3is not 4incinerated 1the 2bush].

4. And as the lord saw that he neared to see, [2called 3him 1the lord] from out of the bush, saying, Moses, Moses.  And he said, What is it?

5.  And he said, You should not approach here. Untie the sandal from  your feet, for the place in which you stand [2ground 1is holy].

6. And he said to him, I am the God  of your father; the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. [3turned 1And 2Moses]  his face, for he venerated to look in the presence of  God.

7. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, In seeing, I saw the ill-treatment  of my people  in Egypt, and  their cry I have heard because of the foremen. For I have seen  their grief.

8. And I came down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to lead them from out of  that land, and to bring them into a land good and populous; into a land flowing milk and honey; into the place of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Gergesites, and Hivites, and Jebusites.

9. And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel is come to me. And I have seen the affliction by which the Egyptians afflict them.

10. And now, come, I shall send you to Pharaoh king of Egypt. And you shall lead  my people the sons of Israel from out of the land of Egypt.

11. And Moses said to  God, Who am I that I shall go to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and that I shall lead out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt?

12. [3said 1And  2God] to Moses, saying that, I will be with you. And this will be to you the sign that I send you in  your leading  my people from out of Egypt, and you shall serve  God in  this mountain. 

13.  The One Being And Moses said to  God, Behold, I will go to the sons of Israel, and I shall say to them, The God  of our fathers sent me to you. And if they shall ask me, What is the name given to him? What shall I say to them?

14. And God said to Moses, I am the one being. And he said, Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, The one being has sent me to you.

15. And God said again to Moses, Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, The lord  God  of our fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob sent me to you; this is my  [2name 1eternal], and a memorial for generations to generations.

16. Going then, gather the council of elders of the sons of Israel! And you shall say to them, The lord  God  of our fathers appeared to me; the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, saying, In overseeing I have watched you, and as much as has come to pass to you in Egypt.

17. And he said, I will haul you from the ill treatment of the Egyptians into the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Hivites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Gergesites, and Jebusites, into a land flowing milk and honey.

18. And they shall hearken to your  voice. And you shall enter, and the council of elders of Israel, to Pharaoh king of Egypt. And you shall say to him, The lord  God of the Hebrews calls us. We shall go then on [3journey 1a three 2days] into the wilderness, that we might sacrifice to the lord  our God.

19. But I know that [4will not 5let you go 1Pharaoh 2king 3of Egypt], [2going 1unless] with [2hand 1a fortified],

20. and stretching out  my hand to strike the Egyptians in all  my wonders, which I will do among them. And after these things I will send you out.

21. And I will give favor to this people before the Egyptians. And whenever you might run from them, you will not go forth empty.

22. But [2will ask 1a woman] from [2neighbor 3and 4fellow tent-dweller 1her] of items of silver, and of gold, and clothes. And you will place them upon  your sons, and upon  your daughters, and you will despoil the Egyptians.  

## Exodus 4

1.  The Rod of Moses [3answered 1And 2Moses] and said, If then they should not believe me, nor listen to  my voice, for they shall say that [2did not 3appear 4to you  1God], what shall I say to them?

2. [3said 1And 4to him 2the lord], What is this the thing in your hand?  And he said, A rod.

3. And he said to him, Toss it upon the ground! And he tossed it upon the ground, and it became a serpent. And Moses fled from it.

4. And the lord said to Moses, Stretch out the hand, and take hold of the tail! Stretching out then the hand, he took hold of the tail, and it became a rod in  his hand --

5. that they might trust you that there appeared to you the lord  God  of their fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

6. [3said 1And 4to him 2the lord] again, Insert  your hand into  your bosom! And he inserted  his hand into  his bosom. And he brought it from out of  his bosom, and [2was  1his hand] leprous as snow.

7. And [2said 3again 4to him 1the lord], Insert  your hand into  your bosom! And he inserted the hand into  his bosom. And he brought it out of  his bosom, and again it was restored unto the complexion  of his flesh.

8. And if they do not believe you, nor hearken to the voice of the [2sign  1first], they will believe you by the voice of the [2sign  1second].

9. And it will be if they do not believe you in [2two 3signs 1these], nor hearken to  your voice, you shall take from the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land. And [8will be  3water 1which 2ever 4you should take 5from 6the 7river] blood upon the dry land.

10. [3said 1And 2Moses] to the lord, I beseech, O lord, [2not 3fit 1I am] before  yesterday nor before the third day, nor from which time you began to speak  to your attendant, [3weak voiced 4and 5slow of tongue 1for I 2am].

11. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Who gave [2a mouth 1man], and who made the hard of hearing and mute, the seeing, and blind? Was it not I the lord  God? 

12.  Aaron Speaks for Moses And now go! And I will open  your mouth, and I will instruct you what you will be about to speak.

13. And Moses said, I beseech, O lord, to handpick another one able whom you shall send.

14. And [2being enraged 3in anger 1the lord] over Moses, said, Behold, is not Aaron  your brother, the Levite? I know that speaking, he will speak to you. And behold, he will come forth to meet you; and seeing you, he will rejoice in himself.

15. And you will say to him, and you will put  my words into  his mouth. And I will open  your mouth and  his mouth, and I will instruct you what you shall do.

16. And he shall speak the things to the people, and he will be your mouth. But you will be to him the things for  God.

17. And  this rod, the one turning into a serpent, you shall take in  your hand in which you will do by it the signs. 

18.  Moses Returns to Egypt [3went 1And 2Moses], and he returned to Jethro  his father-in-law. And he says, I will go, and return to  my brethren, the ones in Egypt, and I will see if they still live. And Jethro said to Moses, Proceed, be in health! But after  [2days  1those many] [4came to an end 1the 2king 3of Egypt].

19. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses in the land of Midian, Proceed, go forth into Egypt! For have died all the ones seeking your  life.

20. [3took up 1And 2Moses] his wife and the male children, and he hauled them upon the beasts of burden, and turned to Egypt. [3took 1And 2Moses] the rod, the one by  God in  his hand.

21. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, In your going and returning unto Egypt, discover all the miracles which I have put in  your hand, to do them before Pharaoh. But I will harden his  heart, and no way shall he send out the people.

22. But you will say  to Pharaoh, Thus says the lord -- son of my first-born, Israel.

23. And I said to you, Send  my people! that they should serve me. If indeed then you should not be willing to send them, see then! I will kill  your son, the first-born!

24. And it came to pass during the journey in the lodging, [3met 4him 1an angel 2of the lord], and sought to kill him.

25. And Zipporah, taking a small sharp stone, circumcised the foreskin  of her son. And she fell at  his feet, and said, [6is stopped 1The 2blood 3of the 4circumcision  5of my male child].

26. And [3went forth 4from 5him 1the 2angel], for she said, [6is stopped 1The 2blood 3of the 4circumcision  5of my male child].

27. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Aaron, Go to meet with Moses in the wilderness! And he went, and he met with him in the mountain  of God, and they kissed one another.

28. And Moses announced  to Aaron all the words of the lord which he sent to him, and all the signs which he gave charge to him.

29. [5went 1And 2Moses 3and 4Aaron], and brought together the council of elders of the sons of Israel.

30. And Aaron spoke all the words which God spoke to Moses. And he did the signs before the people.

31. And [3believed 1the 2people], and rejoiced that God visited the sons of Israel, and that he saw their  affliction. And bowing, the people did obeisance.  

## Exodus 5

1.  Moses and Aaron Before Pharaoh And after these things [4entered 1Moses 2and 3Aaron] to Pharaoh, and they said to him, Thus says the lord  God of Israel. Send forth  my people! that they may solemnize a holiday to me in the wilderness.

2. And Pharaoh said, Who is he, of whom I will listen to  his voice so as to send out the sons of Israel? I do not know the lord, and  [2Israel 1I will not send out].

3. And they say to him, The God of the Hebrews called on us. We will go then on a journey of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the lord  our God, lest at any time [4might meet with 5us 1death 2or 3murder].

4. And [4said 5to them 1the 2king 3of Egypt], Why do you, Moses and Aaron, turn aside the people from the works? Go forth each of you to  his works!

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, now [5are numerous 1The 2people 3of the 4land]; [2not 3then 1I shall] rest them from the works. 

6.  Pharaoh Oppresses Israel [3gave orders 1And 2Pharaoh] to the foremen of the people, and to the scribes, saying,

7. No longer will it be added to give straw to the people for the brickmaking, as yesterday and the third day before. Let them go and bring together for themselves the straw!

8. And the rate of the making of bricks which they produce each day, you shall put it upon them. You shall not remove any of them, for they are idle. On account of this they cry out, saying, We should go and sacrifice to our God.

9. Let [4be oppressive 1the 2works  3of these men], and let [2be anxious 1these men], and not anxious in [2words 1empty]!

10. And hastened of them the foremen, and the scribes of the people. And they said to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, No longer do I give to you straw.

11. You yourselves in going, collect together for yourselves straw! from where ever you should find. For nothing is removed from  your rate, not one thing.

12. And he dispersed the people in the entire land of Egypt to gather together stubble for straw.

13. But the foremen hastened them, saying, You complete the works, the ones fit according to the day, just as also when the straw was given to you.

14. And they were whipped -- the scribes of the race of the sons of Israel, the ones being placed over them by the supervisors  of Pharaoh, and saying, Why did you not complete  your rate of the making of bricks as also yesterday and the third day before and   today?

15. And entering, the scribes of the sons of Israel yelled out to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you thus do  to your servants?

16. Straw has not been given to your servants, and  [3brick 1they tell us 2to make]. And behold,  your servants have been whipped. Shall you wrong therefore  your people?

17. And he said to them, You are idle, you are idlers. Because of this you say, We should go, we should sacrifice to the lord.

18. Now then, in going, work! For the straw [2to you 1shall not be given], and the rate for the making of bricks you shall render.

19. [7seeing 1And 2the 3scribes 4of the 5sons 6of Israel] themselves in bad ways, in the saying, You shall not leave off from the making of bricks  fit for the day,

20. that they met Moses and Aaron coming to meet with them in their going forth from Pharaoh.

21. And they said to them, [2give 4over  1God 3you] and judge, for you caused [2to be abhorred  1our scent] before Pharaoh, and before  his attendants, to put a broadsword into  his hands  to kill us.

22. [3turned 1And 2Moses] to the lord, and said, O lord, for why did you inflict evil on  this people? And why have you sent me?

23. And when I went to Pharaoh to speak in the [2being to you 1name], he inflicted evil on  this people, and you did not rescue  your people.  

## Exodus 6

1.  The LORD Remembers His Covenant And the lord said to Moses, Already you shall see what I will do  to Pharaoh. For with [2hand 1a fortified] he shall send them; and with [2arm 1a high] he will cast them from out of  his land.

2. [3spoke 1And  2God] to Moses, and said to him, I am the lord.

3. And I appeared to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, [3God 1being 2their]. And  my name, the lord, was not manifested to them.

4. And I established  my covenant with them, so as to give to them the land  of Canaan, the land which they sojourned, in which also they sojourned upon it.

5. And I hearkened to the moaning of the sons of Israel, in which the Egyptians reduced them to slavery. And I remembered  your covenant.

6. Proceed, say to the sons of Israel! saying, I am the lord, and I will lead you from the domination of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from  their slavery, and I will ransom you with [2arm 1a high] and [2judgment 1great].

7. And I will take you to myself as a people to me. And I will be your God. And you will know that I am the lord  your God, the one leading you from out of the tyranny of the Egyptians.

8. And I will bring you into the land in which I stretched out  my hand to give it to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. And I will give it to you by lot. I am the lord.

9. [3spoke 1And 2Moses] thus to the sons of Israel, and they did not hearken to Moses because  of faint-heartedness, and because of the [2works  1hard].

10. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, saying,

11. Enter, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt! that he may send out the sons of Israel from  his land.

12. [3spoke 1And 2Moses] before the lord, saying, Behold, the sons of Israel do not listen to me, and how shall [2listen to 3me 1Pharaoh], for I am not reckoned?

13. [3spoke 1And 2the lord] to Moses and Aaron, and he ordered them to Pharaoh king of Egypt, so as to lead out the sons of Israel from out of the land of Egypt. 

14.  The Chiefs of Israel And these are the chiefs of the houses of their families. The sons of Reuben first-born of Israel -- Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi -- this is the kin of Reuben.

15. And the sons of Simeon -- Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the one from the Phoenician woman. These are the families of the sons of Simeon.

16. And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their kin -- Gershon, Kohath and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi -- a hundred thirty-seven years.

17. And these are the sons of Gershon -- Libni and Shimei; the houses of their family.

18. And the sons of Kohath -- Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath -- a hundred thirty years.

19. And the sons of Merari -- Mahli, and Mushi. These are the houses of the families of Levi, according to their kin.

20. And Amram took  Jochebed daughter of the brother  of his father to himself for a wife. And she bore to him  also Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam  their sister. And the years of the life of Amram -- a hundred thirty-seven years.

21. And the sons of Izhar -- Korah, and Nepheg, and Zithri.

22. And the sons of Uzziel -- Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

23. [3took 1And 2Aaron]  Elisheba daughter of Amminadab sister of Naahshon to himself as wife. And she bore to him  also Nadab, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24. And the sons of Korah -- Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasar. These are the generations of Korah.

25. And Eleazar the son of Aaron, took of the daughters of Putiel to himself as wife; and she bore to him  Phinehas. These are the heads of the family of the Levites, according to their generations.

26. This Aaron and Moses, is whom God said to them to lead the sons of Israel from out of Egypt with their force.

27. These are the ones reasoning with Pharaoh king of Egypt, so as to lead the sons of Israel from out of Egypt -- Aaron himself and Moses,

28. in the day the lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt.

29. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying, I am the lord. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt as much as I tell to you!

30. And Moses said before the lord, Behold, I am weak-voiced, and how shall [2listen to 3me 1Pharaoh]?  

## Exodus 7

1.  The LORD Gives Charge to Moses and Aaron And the lord said to Moses, saying, Behold, I have made you as a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron  your brother will be your prophet.

2. But you shall speak to him all as much as I give charge to you.  But Aaron  your brother will speak to Pharaoh, so as to send the sons of Israel from out of his land.

3. But I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will multiply  my signs, and the miracles in the land of Egypt.

4. And [2will not listen to 3you 1Pharaoh], and I will put  my hand against Egypt, and I will lead out with my power  my people the sons of Israel from out of the land of Egypt with [2punishment 1great].

5. And [4shall know 1all 2the 3Egyptians] that I am the lord, stretching out  my hand against Egypt; and I will lead the sons of Israel from their midst.

6. [5did 1And 2Moses 3and 4Aaron] just as [2gave charge 3to them 1the lord] -- thus they did.

7. And Moses was [2years old 1eighty], and Aaron was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.

8. And the lord said to Moses and Aaron, saying,

9. And if [2should speak 3to 4you 1Pharaoh], saying, Give to us a sign or miracle, then [2Aaron shall say  1your brother], Take the rod and toss it upon the ground before Pharaoh, and before  his attendants, and it will be a serpent.

10. [5entered 1And 2Moses 3and 4Aaron] before Pharaoh, and  his attendants. And they did thus, as [2gave charge 3to them 1the lord]. And Aaron tossed the rod before Pharaoh, and before  his attendants. And it became a serpent.

11. [3called together 1And 4the 5wise men 6of Egypt  2Pharaoh], and the sorcerers. And [6did 5also 1the 2enchanters 3of the 4Egyptians]  their sorceries likewise.

12. And [2tossed 1each]  his rod, and they became serpents. And [4swallowed down 1the 2rod  3of Aaron] the rods of those men.

13. And [4grew strong 1the 2heart 3of Pharaoh], and he did not listen to them as [2said 3to them 1the lord]. 

14.  The Waters Turned to Blood [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, [4is weighed down 1The 2heart 3of Pharaoh]  to not send out the people.

15. You proceed to Pharaoh in the morning! Behold, he will go forth upon the water. And you will be able to meet him upon the edge of the river, and the rod, the one turning into a serpent, take in  your hand.

16. And you shall say to him, The lord  God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Send out  my people! that they may serve to me in the wilderness. And behold, you hearkened not unto this time.

17. Thus says the lord, In this you will know that I am the lord. Behold, I strike with the rod  in  my hand upon the water  in the river, and it will turn into blood.

18. And the fishes  in the river shall come to an end. And [3will stink 1the 2river], and [3will not 4be able 1the 2Egyptians] to drink water from the river.

19. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Say to Aaron  your brother, Take  your rod, and stretch out  your hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon  their rivers, and upon  their aqueducts, and upon  their marshes, and upon all [2standing 3water 1their], and there will be blood in all the land of Egypt, in both the wood vessels and in the stone vessels.

20. And [4did 5so 1Moses 2and 3Aaron], just as [2gave charge 3to them 1the lord]. And Aaron lifting  his rod struck the water  in the river before Pharaoh, and before  his attendants. And [7turned 1all 2the 3water  4in 5the 6river] into blood.

21. And the fishes, the ones in the river came to an end. And [3stunk 1the 2river]. And [3were not 4able 1the 2Egyptians] to drink water from out of the river. And [3was 1the 2blood] in all the land of Egypt.

22. [7did 1And 8likewise 2also 3the 4enchanters 5of the 6Egyptians]  in their sorceries. And was hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, just as the lord said.

23. [3turned 1And 2Pharaoh] to enter into  his house, and he did not set  his mind neither upon this thing.

24. [5dug 1And 2all 3the 4Egyptians] round about the river so as to drink water; and they were not able to drink water from the river.

25. And [3were fulfilled 1seven 2days] after the lord struck the river.  

## Exodus 8

1.  Frogs Cover the Land of Egypt [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Enter to Pharaoh! And you shall say to him, Thus says the lord, Send out  my people that they may serve me!

2. But if [2should not 3be willing 1you] to send, behold, I strike all  your boundaries with frogs.

3. And [3will discharge forth 1the 2river] frogs. And in ascending, they shall enter into  your houses, and into the closets  of your bedrooms, and upon  your beds, and into the houses  of your attendants, and  your people, and in  your batches of flour, and in  your ovens.

4. And upon you, and upon  your people, and upon  your attendants [3will ascend 1the 2frogs].

5. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Say to Aaron  your brother! Stretch forth in your hand the rod upon the rivers, and upon the aqueducts, and upon the marshes, and lead the frogs!

6. And Aaron stretched out his hand upon the waters of Egypt, and he led the frogs. And [3was brought up 1the 2frog], and covered all the land of Egypt.

7. [6did 1And 7likewise 8also 2the 3enchanters 4of the 5Egyptians] with their sorceries; and they led the frogs upon the land of Egypt.

8. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Make a vow for me to the lord, and remove the frogs from me, and from  my people! And I will send the people, and they shall sacrifice to the lord.

9. [3said 1And 2Moses] to Pharaoh, Order for me! when should I make a vow for you, and for  your attendants, and  your people, to remove from view the frogs from you, and from  your people, and from  your houses -- except for the ones in the river which shall be left behind?

10.  And he said, During tomorrow. He said therefore, As you have said; that you might see that there is no other besides the lord.

11. And [3shall be removed 1the 2frogs] from you, and from  your houses, and from  your attendants, and from  your people, only the ones in the river will be left behind.

12. [5went forth 1And 2Moses 3and 4Aaron] from Pharaoh. And Moses yelled out to the lord concerning the enactment of the frogs, as Pharaoh arranged.

13. [3did 1And 2the lord] just as Moses said, and ended the frogs from the houses, and from the properties, and from the fields.

14. And they brought them heaps upon heaps, and [3stunk 1the 2land]. 

15.  Midges Cover Man and Beast [3seeing 1And 2Pharaoh] that there came to pass a respite, [2was weighed down  1therefore his heart], and he did not hearken to them, just as the lord said.

16. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Say to Aaron! Stretch out  with your hand  your rod, and strike the embankment of the land! and there will be midges in all the land of Egypt.

17. [3stretched out 1Then 2Aaron 6with the 7hand 4the 5rod], and he struck the embankment of the earth, and there were the midges among both  men and among also the four-footed creatures. And among all embankments of the land there were the midges in all the land of Egypt.

18. [5did 1And 6likewise 4also 2the 3enchanters] in their sorceries, to lead out the midge, but they were not able. And there were  midges among both  men, and among the four-footed creatures.

19. [3said 4then 1And the 2enchanters]  to Pharaoh, [2the finger 3of God 1This is]. And [4was hardened 1the 2heart 3of Pharaoh], and he did not listen to them, just as the lord said. 

20.  The Dog-fly Covers the Land of Egypt [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh! And behold, he will come forth near the water. And you shall say to him, Thus says the lord, Send out  my people! that they shall serve me in the wilderness.

21. But if you do not want to send out  my people, behold, I will send upon you, and upon  your attendants, and upon  your people, and upon  your houses the dog-fly. And [5shall be filled 1the 2houses 3of the 4Egyptians] with the dog-fly, and into the land upon which they are upon it.

22. And I will do an incredible thing in  that day in the land of Goshen, upon which  my people are upon it; upon which there will not be there the dog-fly, that you may know that I am the lord of all the earth.

23. And I will make a difference between  my people, and between  your people. And in the next morning [2will be 3the 4sign 1this] upon the land.

24. [3did 1And 2the lord] so. And [3came 1the 2dog-fly] in multitude in the houses of Pharaoh, and in the houses  of his attendants, and in all the land of Egypt. And [3was utterly destroyed 1the 2land] because of the dog-fly.

25. [3called 1And 2Pharaoh] Moses and Aaron, saying, In going, you sacrifice to your God in the land!

26. And Moses said, It is not possible to be so. For the abominations of the Egyptians we sacrifice to the lord  our God. For if we should sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we shall have stones thrown at us.

27. A journey of three days we shall go into the wilderness, and we shall sacrifice to the lord  our God, just as he told us.

28. And Pharaoh said, I shall send you, and you sacrifice to the lord  your God in the wilderness! but do not [3far away 2to extend 1go]! Make a vow then for me to the lord!

29. [3said 1And 2Moses], Behold I will go forth from you, and I will make a vow to  God, and [3shall go forth 1the 2dog-fly] from you, and from  your attendants, and from  your people tomorrow. You should not add again, O Pharaoh, to deceive completely,  to not send out the people to sacrifice to the lord.

30. [3went forth 1And 2Moses] from Pharaoh, and made a vow to  God.

31. [3did 1And 2the lord] just as Moses said, and removed the dog-fly from Pharaoh, and from  his attendants, and from  his people; and he did not leave behind even one.

32. And Pharaoh was oppressed in his heart also at  this time, and he did not want to send out the people.  

## Exodus 9

1.  Death of the Egyptian Livestock [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Enter to Pharaoh! And you shall say to him, Thus says the lord  God of the Hebrews, Send out  my people! that they may serve to me

2. For if then you do not want to send out  my people, but still to have power over them,

3. behold, the hand of the lord will be against  your cattle  in the plains, and against also the horses, and against the beasts of burden, and the camels, and oxen, and sheep, [3plague 2great 1by an exceedingly].

4. And I will do an incredible thing, even I in  that time, between the cattle of the Egyptians, and between the cattle of the sons of Israel. And there shall not come to an end of any of the ones of the sons of Israel in particular.

5. And God gave confirmation, saying, In the next morning the lord will do  this thing upon the land.

6. And the lord did  this thing in the next day. And there came to an end all the cattle of the Egyptians. But of the cattle of the sons of Israel they did not come to an end -- not one.

7. [3seeing 1And 2Pharaoh] that none came to an end from all of the cattle of the sons of Israel -- not one, [4was oppressed 1the 2heart 3of Pharaoh], and he did not send out the people. 

8.  Boils Break Out in the Land of Egypt [3spoke 1And 2the lord] to Moses and Aaron, saying, Take with you [2full  1hands] of soot of a furnace! and let Moses strew it into the heaven before Pharaoh, and before  his attendants!

9. And let there become a cloud of dust upon all the land of Egypt! and there will be upon  men and upon the four-footed creatures sores of boils breaking out among both  men, and among the four-footed creatures, and in all the land of Egypt.

10. And they took the soot of the furnace before Pharaoh; and [2strew 3it 1Moses] into the heaven; and there became sores of boils breaking out among both  men, and among the four-footed creatures.

11. And [3were not 4able 1the 2sorcerers] to stand before Moses, on account of the sores. [4happened 1For 2the 3sores] among the sorcerers, and in all the land of Egypt.

12. [3hardened 1And 2the lord] the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not hearken to them; as the lord ordered to Moses. 

13.  Hail of Destruction upon Egypt [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh! And you shall say to him, Thus says the lord  God of the Hebrews, Send out  my people! that they may serve to me.

14. [2in 3the 1For] present time I will send out all  my events into  your heart, and  your attendants, and  your people, that you might see that there is not another as I in all the earth.

15. For now, sending  my hand, I will strike you; and  your people I shall put to death; and I will obliterate you from the earth.

16. And because of this you were carefully kept, that I might demonstrate in you  my strength, and how [2should be declared  1my name] in all the earth.

17. Still then you cause  my people  [2to not 3be sent out 1for them].

18. Behold, I rain this  hour tomorrow [3hail 2great 1exceedingly], in which such has not happened in Egypt from which day it was created, and until  this day.

19. Now then hasten to bring together  your cattle, and as much as is to you in the plain! For all the men, and the cattle, as much as might be found in the plains, and what might not enter into a residence, [3should have fallen 1and 4upon 5them  2what hail], it will come to an end.

20. The ones fearing the word of the lord of the attendants of Pharaoh brought together  their cattle into the houses.

21. And he who did not take heed to the thought unto the word of the lord, he allowed the cattle to stay in the plains.

22. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Stretch out  your hand unto  heaven! and there will be hail upon all the land of Egypt; upon both the men, and the cattle, and upon all pasturage  upon the land.

23. [3stretched out 1And 2Moses] his hand unto the heaven, and the lord gave sounds and hail. And [2ran across  1fire] upon the earth. And the lord rained hail upon all the land of Egypt.

24. And there was  hail, and the fire blazing in the hail. And the hail was great -- exceedingly, in which was there not such in Egypt from when there was [2upon 3it 1a nation].

25. [4struck 1And 2the 3hail] in all the land of Egypt -- all as much as was in the plain from man unto beast. And all pasturage  in the plain [3struck 1the 2hail]. And all the trees  in the plains broke.

26. Except in the land of Goshen, of which were there the sons of Israel, there was not  hail.

27. [3sending 1And 2Pharaoh], called  Moses and Aaron, and he said to them, I have sinned  now, the lord is just, but I and  my people are impious.

28. Make a vow then to the lord, and let [3cease  4to happen 1the sounds 2of God], and the hail and fire! And I will send you out, and no longer will I insist for you to remain.

29. [3said 1And 4to him 2Moses], whenever I should go from the city, I will spread forth  my hands to the lord, and the sounds will cease; and the hail and the rain will not be any longer, that you may know that [3is of the 4 lord 1the 2earth].

30. And you and  your attendants -- I know that you do not yet fear the lord.

31. And the flax and the barley were struck. For the barley was standing, and the flax was seeding.

32. And the wheat and the wild oat were not struck, [3late 1for 2it was].

33. [3went forth 1And 2Moses] from Pharaoh outside of the city, and he spread forth the hands to the lord, and the sounds ceased, and the hail; and the rain did not drip any longer upon the land.

34. [3seeing 1And 2Pharaoh] that [3has been ceased 1the 2rain], and the hail, and the sounds -- he added  to sin. And [3was oppressed 1his  2heart], and the ones of his attendants.

35. And [4was hardened 1the 2heart 3of Pharaoh], and he did not send out the sons of Israel; just as the lord said  to Moses.  

## Exodus 10

1.  Locusts Corrupt the Land of Egypt [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, saying, Enter to Pharaoh! for I oppressed  his heart, and the heart of his attendants, that [3in a row 2should come  1these signs] upon them;

2. that you may describe them into the ears  of your children, and to the children  of your children; as much as I mocked the Egyptians, and  my signs which I did among them. And you will know that it is I the lord.

3. [5entered 1And 2Moses 3and 4Aaron] before Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus says the lord, the God of the Hebrews, Until when will you not shame me? Send out  my people! that they may serve to me.

4. But if [2should not want 1you] to send out  my people, behold, I will bring this in the hour tomorrow -- [2locust 1much] upon all  your boundaries.

5. And [5will be covered 1the 2appearance 3of the 4earth], and you will not be able to look down at the ground, and will be eaten up all the extra  being left behind which [3left behind 4for you 1the 2hail]. And will be eaten up every  tree  germinating of yours upon the land.

6. And I will fill your  houses, and the houses  of your attendants, and all the houses in all the land of the Egyptians, which at no time have [2seen  1your fathers], nor  their forefathers, from which day they were upon the land, until  this day. And turning aside he went forth from Pharaoh.

7. And [4say 1the 2attendants 3of Pharaoh] to him, For how long will this be to us an impediment? Send out the men! so that they may serve to the lord  their God. Or [2to see 1do you prefer] that they destroy Egypt?

8. And [5returned  1both 2Moses 3and 4Aaron] to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, and serve to the lord  your God! But which and who are the ones going?

9. And Moses says, With the young and the older we will go; with our sons, and daughters, and sheep, and our oxen; for it is the holiday of the lord  our God.

10. And he said to them, Let it be so! The lord be with you, in so far as I send you; but should also  your belongings? See! for wickedness lies near to you.

11. Not so, let [3go forth 1the 2men] and serve  God! for this they seek after. And they cast them from the face of Pharaoh.

12. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Stretch out  your hand upon the land of Egypt! and let [2ascend 1the locust] upon the land, and it will eat up all the pasturage of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which [3left behind 1the 2hail].

13. And Moses stretched out the rod into the heaven, and the lord brought [2wind 1the south] upon the land [2entire  3day 1that] and entire  night. In the morning came the [2wind  1south] lifting up the locust,

14. and it led it upon all the land of Egypt. And it rested upon all the boundaries of Egypt -- many, exceedingly. Prior of them there were not such locust, and after this there will not be so.

15. And they covered the appearance of the land, and corrupted the land, and ate up all the pasturage of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, which were left behind from the hail. There was not left a green thing, not one thing among the trees, even in all the pasturage of the plain in all the land of Egypt.

16. [3hastened 1And 2Pharaoh] to call Moses and Aaron, saying, I have sinned before the lord  your God, and against you.

17. Favorably receive then my  sin still now, and pray to the lord  your God, and remove from me  this plague!

18. [3went forth 1And 2Moses] from Pharaoh, and made a vow to  God.

19. And the lord turned [2wind 3from 4the sea 1a vehement], and it took up the locust, and cast it into the red sea. And there was not left behind [2locust 1one] in all the land of Egypt.

20. And the lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not send out the sons of Israel. 

21.  Darkness Covers the Land of Egypt [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Stretch out the hand into the heaven, and let [2become 1darkness] upon the land of Egypt -- a tangible darkness!

22. [3stretched out 1And 2Moses] the hand unto the heaven. And there was darkness, dimness, and a storm upon all the land of Egypt three days.

23. And not [2know 1did anyone]  his brother, and not [2rise up 1did anyone] from  his bed for three days. But to all the sons of Israel there was light in all places in which they occupied.

24. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, saying, Proceed, serve the lord  your God! only the sheep and the oxen leave behind! but  [2your belongings 1let] run with you!

25. And Moses said, But also you shall give us means for whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices which we will make to the lord  our God.

26. And  our cattle shall go with us, and we shall not leave behind a hoof. [2of 3them 1For] we shall take to serve the lord  our God. But we know not how we shall serve the lord  our God until the arriving of us there.

27. [3hardened 1But 2the lord] the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not want to send them.

28. And Pharaoh says, Go forth from me! Take heed to yourself yet to add to see my  face! for whatever day you should see me, you shall die.

29. [3says 1And 2Moses], As you have said, no longer shall I appear to you in person.  

## Exodus 11

1.  Death of the First-born Foretold [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Still one more calamity I will bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt, and after this he will send you from here. And whenever he should send you, [4with 5all your things 3by expulsion 1he will cast 2you].

2. You speak then secretly into the ears of the people! And let [2ask 1each man] from the neighbor, and each woman from the neighbor, items of silver and of gold, and clothes!

3. And the lord gave  favor to his people before the Egyptians, and they treated them. And the man Moses [3great 1became 2exceedingly] before the Egyptians, and before Pharaoh, and before  his attendants.

4. And Moses said, Thus says the lord, Around the middle of the night I will enter into the midst of Egypt.

5. And shall come to an end every first-born in the land of Egypt; from the first-born of Pharaoh, who sits down upon the throne, and unto the first-born of the female attendant  by the millstone, and unto the first-born of every beast.

6. And there will be [2cry 1a great] by all the land of Egypt, in which such as was not, and such as no longer shall be added.

7. But among all the sons of Israel there shall not growl even a dog with its tongue, from man unto beast; so that you may see as much as [2does an incredible thing 1the lord] between the Egyptians and  Israel.

8. And [3shall descend 1all  2these your servants] to me, and shall do obeisance to me, saying, You go forth, and all  your people whom you guide! and after these things I will go forth. [3went forth 1And 2Moses] from Pharaoh with rage.

9. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, [2will not listen to 3you 1Pharaoh] that I might multiply  my signs, and  my miracles in the land of Egypt.

10. And Moses and Aaron did all  these miracles in the land of Egypt before Pharaoh. [3hardened 1And 2the lord] the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not want to send the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.  

## Exodus 12

1.  The First Passover [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2.  This month is to you the beginning of months. [2the first 1It is to you] among the months of the year.

3. Speak to all the gathering of the sons of Israel! saying, The tenth  of this month let [2take 1each] a sheep according to the houses of the families! a sheep according to a house.

4. But if there should be very few in the house, so as for there not to be enough for the sheep, he shall include with himself the neighbor,  neighboring him, according to the number of souls, each  sufficient for him to be counted for the sheep.

5. [6sheep 3a perfect 4male 5unblemished 7of a year old 1It shall be 2to you]; from the lambs and from the kids you shall take.

6. And it will be to you for carefully keeping until the fourteenth  of this month. And they shall slay it -- all the multitude of the gathering of the sons of Israel towards evening.

7. And they shall take from the blood, and they shall put it upon the two doorposts, and upon the lintel on the houses in which they should eat them in them.

8. And they shall eat the meats  in this night, roasted by fire; and unleavened breads with bitter herbs they shall eat.

9. You shall not eat of them raw, nor being boiled in water, but  roasted by fire, head with the feet, and the entrails.

10. You shall not leave anything from it into the morning. And [2a bone 1you shall not break] of it. And the things being left behind from it unto morning, [2in 3fire 1you shall incinerate].

11. And thus shall you eat it -- with your loins girded, and the sandals on  your feet, and  your staff in  your hands; and you shall eat it with haste -- it is the passover of the lord.

12. And I shall go through in the land of Egypt in  this night, and I shall strike all first-born in the land of Egypt, from man unto beast; and among all the gods of the Egyptians I will execute  punishment -- I the lord.

13. And [3shall be 1the 2blood] to you for a sign upon the houses in which you are there; and I will see the blood and shelter you; and there shall not be to you a calamity of the obliteration, whenever I smite in the land of Egypt. 

14.  Holiday of Unleavened Bread And [2shall be  1this day] to you a memorial. And you shall solemnize it a holiday to the lord unto  your generations; [2law 1an eternal] you shall solemnize it.

15. Seven days you shall eat unleavened breads. And from the [2day  1first] you shall remove yeast from  your houses. All who ever shall eat yeast, [2shall be utterly destroyed  1that soul] from out of Israel; it shall be from the [2day  1first] until  [3day 1the 2seventh].

16. And  [3day 1the 2first] shall be called holy. And  [3day 1the 2seventh 5called 6holy 4will be] to you. All [2work 1servile] shall not be done in them, except as much as is necessary to do for every soul, this only shall be done by you.

17. And you shall guard  this commandment. For in  this day I will lead  your force from out of the land of Egypt. And you shall appoint  this day into your generations [2law 1as an eternal].

18. Commencing the fourteenth day  [3month 1of the 2first], from evening you shall eat unleavened breads until [4day 1the first 2and 3twentieth] of the month, until evening.

19. For seven days yeast shall not be found in  your houses. All whosoever should eat leavened bread, [2shall utterly be destroyed  1that soul] from out of the congregation of Israel, unto both  foreigners and native born of the land.

20. Anything leavened you shall not eat. In every home of yours you shall eat unleavened breads.

21. [3called 1And 2Moses] the whole council of elders of Israel. And he said to them, Going forth, take to yourselves a sheep according to your kin, and sacrifice the passover!

22. But you shall take a bundle of hyssop, and having dipped it from the blood, of the blood by the door, you shall place it on the lintel and upon both of the doorposts, of the blood which is by the door; and you shall not go forth -- each from the door  of his house until morning.

23. And the lord will go by to strike the Egyptians. And he shall see the blood upon the lintel and upon both of the doorposts. And the lord will go by the door, and he will not leave off the annihilating so as to enter into  your house to strike.

24. And you shall guard  this thing for the law to yourself, and to your sons unto the eon.

25. And if you should enter into the land which ever the lord should give to you, in so far as he spoke, you shall guard  this service.

26. And it will be if [2should say 3to 4you  1your sons], What  is this service?

27. That you shall say to them, [4sacrifice 2the 3passover 1This is] to the lord, as he sheltered the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians,  but our houses he rescued. And bowing, the people did obeisance.

28. And going forth, [4did 1the 2sons 3of Israel] as the lord gave charge  to Moses and Aaron -- so they did. 

29.  Death of the First-born And it happened in the middle of the night, and the lord struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt; from the first-born of Pharaoh, of the one sitting upon the throne, unto the first-born of the captive, of the one in the pit, and every first-born of the beast.

30. And Pharaoh rose up at night, and all  his attendants, and all the Egyptians, and there was [2cry 1a great] in all the land of Egypt. [3no 1For 2there was] house in which there was not one [2in 3it 1dying].

31. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron at night, and he said to them, Rise up, and go forth from  my people, both you and the sons of Israel! Proceed and serve to the lord  your God! as you say.

32. And the sheep and the oxen of yours in taking up, go! just as you say; and bless also me!

33. And [3constrained 1the 2Egyptians] the people with diligence to cast them from the land; for they said that, We all shall die.

34. [4took 1And 2the 3people]  their dough before the leavening  of their batches, being bound in  their cloaks upon their shoulders.

35. And the sons of Israel did as [2ordered 3them 1Moses]. And they asked from the Egyptians items of silver, and of gold, and clothes.

36. And the lord gave  favor to his people before the Egyptians, and they furnished to them; and they despoiled the Egyptians. 

37.  Israel Departs from Egypt [5having departed 1And 2the 3sons 4of Israel] from out of Rameses into Succoth, to the number of six hundred thousand footmen, the males, besides the belongings,

38. and [2intermixed company 1a great] went up with them, and sheep and oxen, and cattle -- many exceedingly.

39. And they baked the dough which they brought from out of Egypt -- [2cakes baked in hot ashes 1unleavened]. [3not 1For 2it was] leavened, [4cast 6out 1because 5them 2the 3Egyptians], and they were not able to remain, nor [2provisions 1to prepare] for themselves for the journey.

40. And the dwelling of the sons of Israel, which they dwelt in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, they and  their fathers -- four hundred thirty years.

41. And it came to pass after the four hundred and thirty year, came forth all the force of the lord from out of the land of Egypt.

42. [2a night 3post 1It is] to the lord, so as to lead them from out of the land of Egypt. That  night itself is a post to the lord, so as [2to all 3the 4sons 5of Israel 1to be] into their generations.

43. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the passover. Every foreigner shall not eat of it.

44. And every domestic servant, any which was bought with silver, you shall circumcise him. And then he shall eat of it.

45. Sojourner or hireling shall not eat of it.

46. In [2house 1one] it shall be eaten, and you shall not bring forth from the house of any of the meats outside, and [2a bone 1you shall not break] of it.

47. Every gathering of the sons of Israel shall do it.

48. And if any [2should come forward 3to 4you 1convert], and should observe the passover to the lord, you shall circumcise [3of his 1every 2male]. And then he shall come forward to do it. And he will be as also the native born of the land. Every uncircumcised one shall not eat of it.

49. [3law 2one 1There shall be] to the native inhabitant, and to the one coming forward to convert among you.

50. And [4did 1the 2sons 3of Israel] as the lord gave charge to Moses and Aaron to them -- so they did.

51. And it came to pass in  that day the lord led out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt with their force.  

## Exodus 13

1.  Sanctification of the First-born [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, saying,

2. Sanctify to me every first-born, first-born of its kind opening wide every womb among the sons of Israel, from man unto beast -- it is mine.

3. [3said 1And 2Moses] to the people, Remember  this day in which you came forth from out of Egypt, from out of the house of slavery. For with [2hand 1a fortified 4led 5you 3the lord] from here, and you shall not eat yeast.

4. For  today you go forth in [3month 1the 2new].

5. And it will be when ever [3should bring 4you 1the lord  2your God] into the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Hivites, and Jebusites, and Gergesites, and Perizzites, which he swore by an oath to your fathers to give to you the land flowing milk and honey, then you shall do  this service in  this month.

6. Six days you shall eat unleavened breads, but the [2day  1seventh] is a holiday of the lord.

7. Unleavened bread shall you eat seven days. There shall not be seen in you leavened bread, nor shall there be to you yeast in all  your boundaries.

8. And you shall announce to your son in  that day, saying, Concerning this [3did 1the lord  2God] to me as I went forth from out of Egypt.

9. And it will be to you for a sign upon  your hand, and a memorial before your eyes, that [4may be 1the 2law 3of the lord] in  your mouth. For with [2hand 1a fortified 4led 5you 3the lord] out of Egypt.

10. And you shall guard  this law according to the times of hours, from days to days.

11. And it shall be whenever [3should bring 4you 1the lord  2your God] into the land of the Canaanites, in which manner he swore by an oath to your fathers, and shall give it to you,

12. that you shall separate every offspring opening the womb, the males to the lord, every offspring opening the womb from the herds among  your cattle. As many as come to pass to you, the males are to the lord.

13. Every newborn opening the womb of donkey you shall barter for sheep. But if you should not barter you shall ransom it. Every first-born of man  of your sons you shall ransom.

14. And if [2should ask 3you  1your son] about these, saying, What is this? And you shall say to him, that, With [2hand 1a fortified] [2led 3you 1the lord] out of the land of Egypt, from out of the house of slavery.

15. And when he hardened Pharaoh to send us, the lord slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of men, unto the first-born of cattle. On account of this I sacrifice to the lord every offspring opening the womb, the males to the lord, and every first-born  of my sons I will ransom.

16. And it shall be for a sign upon  your hand, and unshaken before  your eyes. For by [2hand 1a fortified 4led 5you 3the lord] out of Egypt.

17. And as Pharaoh sent out the people, [2did not 3guide 4them  1God] in the way of the land of the Philistines, for it was near; [3said 1for  2God], Lest at any time [3should repent 1the 2people] seeing war, and they should return into Egypt;

18. and God circled the people in the way -- the one into the wilderness, to the red sea. And in the fifth generation [4ascended 1the 2sons 3of Israel] from out of the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for with an oath Joseph bound the sons of Israel, saying, With a visit the lord will visit you, and you shall join in carrying off  my bones from here with you.

20. [5lifted away 1And 2the 3sons 4of Israel] from out of Succoth, and they encamped in Etham by the wilderness. 

21.  The Pillars of Cloud and Fire  But God led them, by day  by a column of cloud, to show to them the way; but in the night by a column of fire.

22. [4did not 5fail 1The 2column  3of cloud] by day, and the column  of fire by night before all the people.  

## Exodus 14

1.  Israel Camps at the Sea And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel! And turning let them encamp before the property between Migdol and between the sea, right opposite Baal-Zephon! Before them you shall encamp by the sea.

3. And Pharaoh will say concerning the sons of Israel, These wander in the land, [4has closed 6up 1for 5them 2the 3wilderness].

4. But I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and he will pursue after them, and I will be glorified by Pharaoh, and by all  his military; and [4shall know 1all 2the 3Egyptians] that I am the lord. And they did thus.

5. And it was announced to the king of the Egyptians that [3have fled 1the 2people]. And [4was converted 1the 2heart 3of Pharaoh], and the hearts of his attendants against the people. And they said, What is this we have done  to send out the sons of Israel  to not slave to us?

6. [3teamed up 2then 1Pharaoh]  his chariots, and [2all  3his people 1he led] with himself.

7. And he took six hundred [2chariots 1chosen], and all the cavalry of the Egyptians, and tribunes over all.

8. And the lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he pursued after the sons of Israel. But the sons of Israel went with [2hand 1a high].

9. And [3pursued 1the 2Egyptians] after them. And they found them camping by the sea. And all the cavalry, and the chariots of Pharaoh, and the horsemen, and  his military were before the property right opposite Baal-zephon.

10. And Pharaoh led forward. And [4looking up 1the 2sons 3of Israel] with the eyes, they beheld. And behold, the Egyptians were encamped behind them. And they feared exceedingly. [5yelled out 1And 2the 3sons 4of Israel] to the lord.

11. And they said to Moses, Because there were no [2existing 1tombs] in Egypt you led us  to be put to death in the wilderness? What is this you did to us bringing us forth from out of Egypt?

12. [2this not 1Was] the saying which we spoke in Egypt to you? saying, Disregard us! so that we may slave to the Egyptians. For it is better for us to slave to the Egyptians, than to die in  this wilderness.

13. [3said 1And 2Moses] to the people, Be of courage! Stand, and see the deliverance  by the lord, which he will do for us today! [2in which 3manner 1For] you see the Egyptians today, you will not proceed still to see them into the eon of time.

14. The lord will wage war for us, and you shall be quiet.

15. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Why do you yell to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, and break camp! 

16.  God Draws Away the Sea And you, lift up  your rod, and stretch out  your hand upon the sea, and tear it! And let [4enter 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in the midst of the sea on  dry land!

17. And behold, I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and [2the 3Egyptians 1all]; and they will enter in after them, and I will be glorified by Pharaoh, and by all  his military, and by the chariots, and by  his horses.

18. And [4shall know 1all 2the 3Egyptians] that I am the lord glorifying myself by Pharaoh, and by the chariots, and by  his horses.

19. [5lifted away 1And 2the 3angel  4of God], the one going before the camp of the sons of Israel, and he went at the rear. And lifted away also the column  of cloud from their sight, and it stood at the rear of them.

20. And it entered between the camp of the Egyptians and between the camp of Israel, and it stood. And there was darkness and dimness. And [3went by 1the 2night]. And they did not mix together one to another the entire night.

21. [3stretched out 1And 2Moses] his hand upon the sea. And the lord drew away the sea by [3wind 2south 1a violent] the entire night. And he made the sea dry, and cut asunder the water.

22. And [4entered 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in the midst of the sea down on the dry land. And  its water was a wall from the right and a wall from the left.

23. [4pursued 1And 2the 3Egyptians]. And [5entered 6after 7them 1all 2the 3cavalry 4of Pharaoh], and the chariots, and the riders in the midst of the sea.

24. And it came to pass in the watch, in the early morning, and the lord gave attention unto the camp of the Egyptians with a column of fire and a cloud; and he disturbed the camp of the Egyptians.

25. And he bound the axles  of their chariots, and led them with force. And [3said 1the 2Egyptians], We should flee from the face of Israel, for the lord wages war for them against the Egyptians.

26. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Stretch out  your hand upon the sea, and restore the water, and cover over the Egyptians, over both the chariots and over the riders!

27. [3stretched out 1And 2Moses] his hand upon the sea, and [3restored 1the 2water] at day to its place. And the Egyptians fled from under the water. And the lord shook off the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

28. And in turning back, the water covered the chariots, and the riders, and all the force of Pharaoh, of the ones entering after them into the sea. And there was not left of them not even one.

29. And the sons of Israel went through dry land in the midst of the sea. And the water was to them a wall on the right, and a wall on the left.

30. And the lord rescued  Israel in  that day from the hand of the Egyptians. And Israel saw the Egyptians having died by the edge of the sea.

31. [3saw 1And 2Israel  6hand 4the 5great] by which the lord executed against the Egyptians. [4feared 1And 2the 3people] the lord, and they trusted  in God, and Moses  his attendant.  

## Exodus 15

1.  The Ode of Moses and Israel Then they sang, Moses and the sons of Israel,  this ode to the lord. And they said, We should sing to the lord, for gloriously he is glorified; horse and rider he tossed into the sea.

2. Helper and shelterer he became to me for deliverance; this is my God, and I will glorify him; the God  of my father, and I will exalt him.

3. The lord breaking by wars; the lord is his name.

4. The chariots of Pharaoh, and  his force he tossed into the sea; chosen riders -- tribunes he sank in the red sea.

5. A high sea covered them; they descended unto the bottom of the sea as stone.

6.  Your right hand, O lord, has been glorified in strength;  your right hand, O lord, devastated the enemies.

7. And in the magnitude  of your glory you broke the opponents. You sent  your anger, and it devoured them as stubble.

8. And by the breath  of your rage [3was parted 1the 2water]; [2a banked up 1as] wall were the waters; [4were banked up 1and 2the 3waves] in the midst of the sea.

9. [3said 1The 2enemy], In pursuing I shall overtake; I shall portion the spoils; I shall fill up my soul; I will take up  my sword; [2will dominate  1my hand].

10. You sent  your breath, [2covered 3them 1the sea]; they went down as lead in [2water 1vehement].

11. Who is likened to you among gods, O lord? Who is likened to you, being glorified among holy ones, wonderful in glories, doing miracles?

12. You stretched out  your right hand, [2swallowed 3them 1the earth].

13. You guided by your righteousness --  [2your people 1this] whom you ransomed. You aided in your strength in [2lodging 1your holy].

14. [2heard 1Nations], and were provoked to anger; pangs took hold of the ones dwelling among the Philistines.

15. Then hastened the princes of Edom, and the rulers of the Moabites; [2took hold 3of them 1trembling]; they melted away -- all the ones dwelling in Canaan.

16. May there fall upon them fear and trembling; by the greatness of your arm they are petrified, until whenever [2may go by  1your people], O lord, until whenever [3may go by  2your people 1this], whom you acquired.

17. Bringing them in -- plant them in [2mountain 3of inheritance 1your]; into [2prepared 3home 1your] which you manufactured, O lord; the sanctuary, O lord, which you prepared by your hands.

18. The lord reigning into the eon, and unto eon, and still!

19. For [3entered 1the horse 2of Pharaoh] with chariots and riders into the sea; and [2brought 3upon 4them 1the lord] the water of the sea. But the sons of Israel went through dry land in the midst of the sea.

20. [8took 1And 2Miriam 3the 4prophetess 5the 6sister 7of Aaron] the tambourine in  her hand. And came forth all the women after her with tambourines and dancers.

21. [3led 1And 4them 2Miriam], saying, We should sing to the lord, for gloriously he glorified himself -- horse and rider he tossed into the sea. 

22.  Bitter Water at Marah [3lifted up 1And 2Moses] the sons of Israel from [2sea 1the red], and he led them into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness, and they did not find water so as to drink.

23. And they came unto Marah. And they were not able to drink water at Marah, [3bitter 1for 2it was]. On account of this [4was named 1the 2name  3of that place], Bitter.

24. And [3complained 1the 2people] unto Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

25. [3yelled 1And 2Moses] to the lord. And [3showed 4to him 1the 2 lord] a tree. And he put it into the water, and [3was sweetened 1the 2water]. There he established with him ordinances and judgments, and there he tested him.

26. And he said, If you should hear the voice of the lord  your God, and [2the things 3pleasing 4before 5him 1you should do], and you should give ear to  his commandments, and you should guard all  his ordinances, then every disease which was brought upon the Egyptians, I will not bring upon you. For I am the lord  healing you.

27. And they came into Elim. And there were there twelve springs of waters, and seventy trunks of palm trees; and they camped there by the waters.  

## Exodus 16

1.  The LORD Rains Bread And they departed from Elim, and [5came 1all 2the congregation 3of the sons 4of Israel] unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and between Sinai. And on the fifteenth day in [3month 1the 2second] they went forth from the land of Egypt.

2. [7complained 1All 2the 3gathering 4of the 5sons 6of Israel] to Moses and Aaron.

3. And [4said 5to 6them 1the 2sons 3of Israel], Ought we died being struck by the lord in the land of Egypt, whenever we sat at the kettles of the meats, and ate bread loaves in fullness. For you led us into  this wilderness to kill all  this congregation by hunger.

4. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Behold, I rain upon you bread loaves from out of the heaven; and [3shall come forth 1the 2people], and they shall collect together the bread  day to day, that I should test them if they shall go by  my law or not.

5. And it will be in  [3day 1the 2sixth], and they shall prepare what ever they should carry in, and it shall be double what ever they should bring  according to day by day.

6. [5said 1And 2Moses 3and 4Aaron] to all the gathering of the sons of Israel, At evening you will know that the lord led you out of the land of Egypt.

7. And in the morning you will see the glory of the lord, in the hearing  of your grumbling against  God. And we, what are we that you complain against us?

8. And Moses said, It is in the [2giving 1the lord] to you in the evening meats to eat, and bread loaves in the morning for fullness, on account of the lord's hearing  your grumbling which you complain against us. But we, what are we? For not [3against 4us  2your grumbling 1is], but against  God.

9. [3said 1And 2Moses] to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel! Come forward before  God! for he has heard  your grumbling.

10. And when Aaron spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, that they turned into the wilderness, and the glory of the lord appeared in a cloud. 

11.  The LORD Sends the Mother-quail And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

12. I have heard the grumbling of the sons of Israel. Speak to them! saying,  Towards evening you shall eat meats, and in the morning you will be filled of bread loaves. And you shall know that I am the lord  your God.

13. And it was evening. And there ascended the mother-quail, and it covered the camp. And in the morning there was a resting of the dew round about the camp.

14. And behold, upon the face of the wilderness, a thin thing as coriander -- white, as ice upon the earth.

15. And seeing it, the sons of Israel said, an other to the other, What is this? [3not 1For 2they had] known what it was. [3said 1And 2Moses] to them, This is the bread which the lord gave to you to eat.

16. This is the thing which the lord ordered. Bring together of it each for what is fitting! A homer per head, according to the number of your souls; [2each 3with  4your tents 1let] collect together!

17. And [4did 5so 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they collected together what was  much and what was  less.

18. And measuring with the homer, [3was not 4superabundant 1the one which  2had much], and the one which  had less had not too less, for each  [2what was fitting 3for 4himself 1collected together].

19. [3said 1And 2Moses] to them, Let no one leave behind of his into the morning!

20. And they did not hearken to Moses, but left behind some of it into the morning. And [2erupted 1worms], and it stunk. And [2was embittered 3over 4them 1Moses].

21. And they collected it together morning by morning, each the fitting thing for himself. And when [3warmed through 1the 2sun], it melted away.

22. And it happened in the [2day  1sixth] they collected together the necessary double amount, two homers to the one person. [7entered 1And 2all 3the 4rulers 5of the 6congregation], and announced to Moses.

23. [3said 1And 2Moses] to them, This  word is what the lord spoke. A Sabbath rest, holy to the lord is tomorrow. Whatever as much as you should bake -- bake. And whatever as much as you should boil -- boil! And all that being superabundant leave it for reposit for the morning!

24. And they left of it into the morning, as [2ordered 3them 1Moses]. And it did not stink, nor [2a worm 1was there] in it.

25. [3said 1And 2Moses], You eat it today, for it is a Sabbath to the lord! Today you shall not find any in a plain.

26. Six days you shall collect together, but the [2day  1seventh] is a Sabbath, for it shall not be found in it.

27. And it came to pass on the seventh day, and came forth certain ones from the people to collect together, and they did not find.

28. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, For how long will you not listen to  my commandments, and  my law?

29. See! for the lord gave to you [2Sabbath  3day 1this]. On account of this he gave to you on the [2day  1sixth] bread loaves for two days. Let [2sit down 1each] in  your houses by himself! Not one of you go forth from out of  his place during the [2day  1seventh]!

30. And [3observed the Sabbath 1the 2people] in the [2day  1seventh].

31. And [4named 5it 1the 2sons 3of Israel] -- the name of it, Manna. And it was as the seed of coriander -- white. And the taste of it was as pastry with honey.

32. [3said 1And 2Moses], This is the thing which the lord ordered. Fill the homer of the manna, for reposit for  your generations! that they might see the bread which you ate in the wilderness, as [2led 3you 1the lord] out of the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said to Aaron, Take [3jar 2golden 1one], and put in it a full  homer  of manna, and put it aside before  God for preservation into  your generations!

34. In which manner the lord ordered  Moses, even [2put 4aside 1Aaron 3it] before the testimony for preservation.

35. And the sons of Israel ate the manna [2years 1forty], until they came into the land to be lived in. [2the 3manna 1They ate] until they came into a part  of Phoenicia.

36. Now the homer [2the 3tenth  4of three 5measures 1was].  

## Exodus 17

1.  Moses Strikes the Rock at Horeb And [6departed 1all 2the 3congregation 4of the sons 5of Israel] from out of the wilderness of Sin, according to their camps, through the saying of the lord. And they camped in Rephidim. [2there was no 1But] water for the people to drink.

2. And [3reviled 1the 2people] against Moses, saying, Give to us water! that we may drink. And [2said 3to them 1Moses], Why do you revile me? And why do you test the lord?

3. [4thirsted 1And 5there 2the 3people] for water. And [3complained 1the 2people] against Moses, saying, Why is this that you hauled us from out of Egypt  to kill us, and  our children, and the cattle  by thirst?

4. [3yelled 1And 2Moses] to the lord, saying, What should I do  with this people? Yet in a little while and they will cast stones at me.

5. And the lord said to Moses, Go before  this people! and take with yourself some of the elders of the people, and the rod in which you struck the river! Take it in  your hand and go!

6. Behold, I stand there, before  your coming upon the rock in Horeb. And you shall strike the rock, and shall come forth from out of it water, and [3shall drink 1the 2people]. [3did 1And 2Moses] thus before the sons of Israel.

7. And he named the name  of that place -- Test and Reviling; on account of the reviling of the sons of Israel, and on account of the testing the lord, saying, Is the lord with us or not? 

8.  Amalek Wages War with Israel [3came 1And 2Amalek] and waged war against  Israel in Rephidim.

9. [3said 1And 2Moses]  to Joshua, Choose for yourself [2men 1mighty], and going forth deploy against  Amalek tomorrow! And behold, I shall stand upon the top of the hill, and the rod  of God in  my hand.

10. And Joshua did as [2told 3to him 1Moses]. And going forth he deployed against  Amalek. And Moses and Aaron and Hur ascended upon the top of the hill.

11. And it happened whenever Moses lifted up the hands, Israel grew strong. But whenever he lowered his hands, Amalek grew strong.

12. And the hands of Moses became heavy. And taking a stone they placed it under him, and he sat down upon it. And Aaron and Hur supported  his hands; here one and there one. And [4were 1the 2hands 3of Moses] supported until the descent of the sun.

13. And Joshua routed  Amalek, and all  his people by a carnage of the sword.

14. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a scroll, and put it unto the ears of Joshua! For as ointment I will wipe away the memorial of Amalek from  under  heaven.

15. And Moses built an altar to the lord, and named the name of it, The lord My Refuge,

16. for with [2hand 1a hidden] the lord wages war against Amalek from generations unto generations.  

## Exodus 18

1.  Jethro Reunites with Moses [9heard 1And 2Jethro 3the 4priest 5of Midian 6the 7father-in-law 8of Moses] all as much as the lord did to Israel, to his own people; [3led 1for 2the lord]  Israel out of Egypt.

2. [6took 1And 2Jethro 3the 4father-in-law 5of Moses] Zipporah the wife of Moses after  her release,

3. and the two sons of his -- the name to the one was Gershom, saying, I was a sojourner in [2land 1an alien].

4. And the name of the second was Eliezer, saying, For the God  of my father is my helper, and he rescued me from out of the hand of Pharaoh.

5. And came forth Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, and the sons, and the wife, to Moses, into the wilderness of which place he camped at the mountain  of God.

6. And it was announced to Moses, saying, Behold,  your father-in-law Jethro comes to you, and  your wife, and  [2two 3sons 1your] with him.

7. [3came forth 1And 2Moses] to meet with  his father-in-law; and he did obeisance to him, and he kissed him, and they greeted one another, and he brought them into the tent.

8. And Moses described to his father-in-law all as much as the lord did  to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians, on account  of Israel; and all the trouble, the one coming to them in the way; and that [2rescued 3them 1the lord] from out of the hand of Pharaoh, and from out of the hand of the Egyptians.

9. [3was amazed 1And 2Jethro] by all the good things which [2did 3to them 1the lord]; that [2rescued 3them 1the lord] from out of the hand of the Egyptians, and from out of the hand of Pharaoh.

10. And Jethro said, Blessed be the lord, for he rescued  his people from out of the hand of the Egyptians, and from out of the hand of Pharaoh.

11. Now I know that the lord is great above all the gods, because of of this -- that they made an attempt against them.

12. And [5took 1Jethro 2the 3father-in-law 4of Moses] whole burnt-offerings, and sacrifices  to God. [8came 1For 2Aaron 3and 4all 5the 6elders 7of Israel] to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before  God. 

13.  Jethro Advises Moses And it came to pass after the next day, Moses sat down to judge the people, [5stood by 1and 2all 3the 4people] Moses from morning until evening.

14. And Jethro seeing all as much as he did to the people, says, What is this which you do to the people? Why do you sit down alone, and all the people stand by you from morning until afternoon?

15. And Moses says to his father-in-law, Because [3come 4to 5me 1the 2people] to seek after a judgment from  God.

16. For whenever there is to them a dispute, and they should come to me, I litigate each, and I instruct them in the orders  of God, and  his law.

17. [4said 1And 2the 3father-in-law] to Moses to him, Not rightly do you do  this thing.

18. [5corruption 3will be corrupted 4in unsufferable 1And 2you], and all  this people, which is with you. [2is heavy 3on you  1This thing], you will not be able to act yourself alone.

19. Now then hear me! and I shall advise you, and God will be with you. You become to the people, the one before  God! and you shall offer  their words to  God.

20. And you shall testify to them the orders  of God, and  his law, and you shall signify to them the ways in which they shall go by them, and the works which they shall do.

21. And you yourself look about all the people for men mighty and godly! [2men 1just] detesting pride. And you shall place them over them commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds, and commanders of fifties, and commanders of tens.

22. And they shall judge the people at every hour. But the [2thing  1enormous] they shall offer unto you; but the little matters of the judgments, they shall judge them; and they shall lighten the load from you, and shall give aid to you.

23. If  this thing you do, then [2will strengthen 3you  1God], and you will be able to stand, and all  this people shall come unto  their own place with peace.

24. [3hearkened 1And 2Moses] to the voice  of his father-in-law, and he did as much as he said to him.

25. And Moses chose [2men 1mighty] from all Israel, and appointed them over them as commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds, and commanders of fifties, and commanders of tens, and judicial recorders.

26. And they judged the people every hour, but the [2matter  1enormous] they offered to Moses. But every [2matter 1light] they judged themselves.

27. [3sent out 1And 2Moses]  his own father-in-law, and he went forth unto  his land.  

## Exodus 19

1.  Israel Camps at Sinai And in the [2month  1third] of the exodus of the sons of Israel from the land Egypt,  on this day they came into the wilderness  of Sinai.

2. And they lifted away from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness  of Sinai, and [2camped 3there 1Israel] over against the mountain.

3. And Moses ascended into the mountain  of God. And [2called 3him  1God] from the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and announce to the sons of Israel,

4. [4to them 1You have seen 2as much as 3I have done] -- to the Egyptians. And I took you as upon wings of eagles, and led you to myself.

5. And now, if in hearing, you should hear  my voice, and guard  my covenant, you will be to me [2people 1a prized] from all the nations. [6mine 1For 5is 2all 3the 4earth].

6. And you shall be to me a royal priesthood, and [2nation 1a holy]. These  words you shall say to the sons of Israel.

7. [3came 1And 2Moses], and called the elders of the people, and placed near them all  these words which [2gave orders 3to them  1God].

8. [5answered 1And 2all 3the 4people] with one accord, and said, All, as much as God said, we shall do, and we shall hearken. [3offered 1And 2Moses] the words of the people to  God.

9. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Behold, I come to you in a column of cloud, that [3may hear 1the 2people] me speaking to you, and may trust you into the eon. [3announced 1And 2Moses] the words of the people to the lord.

10. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, In going down, testify to the people, and purify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash  their garments!

11. And let them be prepared for  [3day 1the 2third]!  For [3day 1on the 2third 5shall come down 4the lord] upon  mount  Sinai before all the people.

12. And you shall separate the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves  ascending unto the mountain, and [2lightly touching 1any] of it. All  touching the mountain, by death he will come to an end.

13. [2shall not touch it 1His hand], for with stones they shall be stoned or with an arrow they shall be shot; if it be also cattle, or if it be also man, he shall not live. And whenever the voices, and the trumpets, and the cloud go forth from the mountain, they shall ascend to the mountain.

14. [3went down 1And 2Moses] from the mountain to the people, and sanctified them. And they washed  their garments.

15. And he said to the people, Be prepared three days, come forward not to a woman.

16. And it came to pass  [3day 1on the 2third], happening towards dawn, and there were voices, and lightnings, and [2clouds 1overcast] upon mount Sinai; the voice of the trumpet sounded greatly, and [7were terrified 1all 2the 3people  4in 5the 6camp].

17. And Moses led the people for  a meeting with  God from the camp. And they stood by the mountain.

18. The mount  Sinai smoked entirely on account of  God coming down upon it in fire. [4ascended 1And 2the 3smoke] as smoke of a furnace. And [5amazed 1all 2the 3people 4were exceedingly].

19. And there were the sounds of the trumpet advancing strong -- exceedingly. Moses spoke,  and God answered to him by voice. 

20.  Moses and Aaron Called unto Mount Sinai [3came down 1And 2the lord] upon  mount  Sinai, upon the top of the mountain. And the lord called Moses unto the top of the mountain; and Moses ascended.

21. And God said to Moses, saying, Go down to testify to the people! lest at any time they should approach to  God to contemplate, and [3should fall 2of them 1a multitude].

22. And the priests, the ones approaching to the lord  God, let them be sanctified! lest at any time [2should get rid 3of 4them 1the lord].

23. And Moses said to  God, [3shall not 4be able 1the 2people] to ascend to  mount  Sinai, for you testified to us, saying, Separate from the mountain and sanctify it!

24. [3said 1And 4to him 2the lord], Proceed, go down, and then ascend, you and Aaron with you! But the priests and the people shall not use force to ascend to  God, lest at any time [2should destroy 3some of 4them 1the lord].

25. [3went down 1And 2Moses] to the people, and spoke to them.  

## Exodus 20

1.  Ten Commandments And the lord spoke all  these words, saying,

2. I am the lord  your God, the one leading you from the land of Egypt, from out of the house of slavery.

3. There shall not be to you other gods besides me.

4. You shall not make to yourself an idol, nor any representation, as much as is in the heaven upward, nor as much as is in the earth below, nor as much as is in the waters underneath the earth.

5. You shall not do obeisance to them, nor shall you serve to them. For I am the lord  your God, a jealous God, rendering sins of fathers upon children unto the third and fourth generation to the ones detesting me;

6. and having mercy to thousands  loving me, and  guarding  my orders.

7. You shall not take the name of the lord  your God in vain.  For no way shall the lord cleanse the one taking  his name in vain.

8. Remember the day of the Sabbaths to sanctify it!

9. Six days you shall work, and shall do all  your works;

10. but the [2day  1seventh] is a Sabbath to the lord  your God. You shall not do on it any work -- you, and  your son, and  your daughter,  your servant, and  your maidservant,  your ox, and  your beast of burden, and all your cattle, and the convert -- the one sojourning among you.

11. For in six days the lord made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them. And he rested on the [2day  1seventh]. Because of this the lord blessed the [2day  1seventh], and sanctified it.

12. Esteem  your father and  your mother! that good should happen to you, and that [2a long time 1you may be] upon the [2earth  1good] which the lord  your God gives to you.

13. You shall not murder.

14. You shall not commit adultery.

15. You shall not steal.

16. You shall not witness falsely against  your neighbor [2witness 1as a lying].

17. You shall not covet the wife  of your neighbor. You shall not covet the house  of your neighbor, nor  his field, nor  his manservant, nor  his maidservant, nor  his ox, nor  his beast of burden, nor any of his beasts, nor as much [2to 3your neighbor 1is].

18. All the people perceived the voice, and the lamps, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. And fearing, all the people stood afar off.

19. And they said to Moses, You speak to us, and do not let [2speak 3to 4us  1God]! lest we might die.

20. And [2says 3to them 1Moses], Be of courage! because  [5to test 6you 2came  1God 3to 4you], so that there might be the fear of him in you, that you should not sin!

21. [5stood 1And 2all 3the 4people] afar off. But Moses entered into the dimness where God was.

22. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and announce to the sons of Israel, You have seen that from out of the heaven I have spoken to you.

23. You shall not make to yourselves gods of silver, and gods of gold; you shall not make them to yourselves.

24. An altar from out of the earth you shall make to me, and you shall sacrifice upon it  your whole burnt-offerings, and  your deliverance offerings -- the sheep, and  your calves, in every place of which ever I should name  my name there. And I will come to you, and I will bless you.

25. And if [2an altar 3of 4stones 1you should make] to me, you shall not build them cut into shape; for [2your knife 1you have put] upon them, and they are defiled.

26. You shall not ascend by stairs unto  my altar, so that you should not uncover  your indecency upon it.  

## Exodus 21

1.  Ordinances Regarding Servants And these are the ordinances which you shall place before them.

2. If you should acquire [2servant 1a Hebrew], [3six 4years 1he shall serve 2to you], but the seventh year you shall send him free without charge.

3. If he alone should enter, also alone he shall go forth; but if a wife should enter together with him, also the wife shall go out together with him.

4. And if the master should give to him a wife, and she should bear to him, sons and daughters, the wife and the children shall be  his masters, and he alone shall go forth by himself.

7. But if any should give over  his own daughter as a domestic servant, she shall not go forth as [3run forth 1the 2maidservants].

8. If she should not be well-pleasing to her master, who did not solemnly promise her; on payment of ransom he shall release her; [8nation 1but 7to an alien 4not 2the master 3is 5to sell 6her], for he disrespected  her.

12.  Ordinances of Liability And if any should strike any, and he should die, to death let him be put to death!

13. But if it be done not willingly, but  God delivered up into  his hands, I will give to you a place in which he shall flee there -- the one man-slaying.

18. And if [3revile each other 1two 2men], and one should strike the neighbor with a stone or fist, and he should not die, but lies down upon the bed;

19. if in arising, the man should walk outside upon his cane, [3will be innocent 1the one 2striking]; except  [2for his idleness 1he shall pay], and the physician's fee.

20. But if any strike  his servant or  his maidservant with a rod, and one should die by  his hand, with punishment let him be punished!

21. And if the one should continue to live [2day 1one] or two, he shall not be punished,  for [2his money 1he is].

22. And if [3should do combat 1two 2men], and should strike a woman [2in 3the womb 1having one], and should come forth  her child not completely formed, with a fine he shall be penalized, in so far as [5should put upon him 1the 2husband 3of the 4woman], and he shall give by means of what is fit.

23. And if [2completely formed 1it should be], he shall give life for life,

24. eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

25. burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

26. And if any should strike the eye  of his man-servant, or the eye  of his female attendant, and he should blind; [3free 1he shall send 2them] on account  of their eye.

27. And if the tooth of the man-servant, or the tooth  of his female attendant he should knock out; [3free 1he shall send 2them] on account of  their tooth.

28. And if [2should gore 1a bull] a man or woman, and either die; with stones you shall stone the bull, and you shall not eat  of its meats; but the owner of the bull shall be innocent.

29. But if the bull [2goring 1was] before  yesterday and before the third day before, and men testified to its owner, and he should not remove it; and if it should have done away with a man or a woman, they shall stone the bull, and the owner of it shall die in addition.

30. And if ransoms should be put to him, he shall give ransoms for the life of it, as much as should be put upon him.

31. And if a son or daughter should be gored, according to  this ordinance they shall observe it.

9. According to every particular offence, concerning both calf, and beast of burden, and sheep, and garment, and every destruction  being accused, the one who then should be, before  God [4shall come 1the 2judgment 3of both], then the one convicted by  God shall pay double to his neighbor.

10. And if any should give to the neighbor a beast of burden, or a calf, or sheep, or any cattle to guard; and it should break, or come to an end, or [2captive 1become], and no one should know,

11. there shall be an oath  of God between both, swearing that assuredly he had not done wickedly to partake altogether of the deposit put in care by his neighbor, and thus [2shall receive him favorably  1his owner], and he shall not pay.

31. And [3men 2holy 1you shall be] to me, and meat in a field taken by wild beasts you shall not eat, [2to the 3dogs 1throw it away]!  

## Exodus 23

6. You shall not turn aside a judgment of the needy in his judgment.

7. From all things unjust you shall abstain. The innocent and the just you shall not kill. And you shall not give justice to the impious because of bribes.

8. And bribes you shall not receive; for the bribes blind the eyes for seeing and lay waste [2matters 1just].

9. And a foreigner you shall not maltreat, nor in any way afflict. For you know the soul of the foreigner, for you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 

10.  The Seventh Year and Day Six years you shall sow  your land, and you shall gather  its produce,

11. but on the seventh [2a release from work 1you shall make], and spare it, and [4shall eat 1the 2poor  3of your nation]; and the things being left behind of them [3shall eat 1the 2wild beasts] of the field. Thus you shall do  with your vineyard, and  your olive grove.

12. Six days you shall do  your works, but on the [2day  1seventh] you shall rest, that [3may rest  2ox 1your], and  your beast of burden, and that [4may be refreshed 1the 2son  3of your maidservant], and the foreigner.

13. All, as much as I have spoken to you, guard! And the name [2gods 1of other] you shall not call to mind, nor should one be heard from out of  your mouth. 

14.  The Three Holidays Three times of the year solemnize a holiday to me!

15. The holiday of the unleavened breads keep to do! Seven days you shall eat unleavened breads, just as I gave charge to you, according to the time of the month of the new produce; for in it you came forth from out of Egypt. You shall not appear before me empty.

16. And a holiday of the harvest of the first produce you shall observe  of your works, what ever you sow in  your field; and a holiday of completion at the conclusion of the year in the gathering  of your works, of the ones from out of  your field.

17. Three times  a year [4shall appear 1every 2male 3of yours] before the lord  your God.

18. For whenever I should cast out the nations from your face, and widen  your boundaries, you shall not sacrifice with yeast the blood of my sacrifice, neither shall [3remain through the night 1the fat  2of my holiday feast] until morning.

19. The first-fruits of the first produce  of your land you shall carry into the house of the lord  your God. You shall not boil a lamb in [2milk 1her mother's]. 

20.  Warning against Serving Other Gods And behold, I send  my messenger before your face, that he may guard you in the way, that he may bring you into the land which I prepared for you.

21. Take heed to yourself, and hearken to him, and do not resist his persuasion,  for he should not avoid you,  for my name is upon him!

22. If in hearing you shall hearken  to my voice, and do all as much as I give charge to you, I will be an enemy to your enemies, and I will be an adversary to the ones being an adversary of you.

23. [3shall go 1For  2my messenger] leading you; and he will bring you to the Amorite, and Hittite, and Perizzite, and Canaanite, and Gergesite, and Hivite, and Jebusite; and I will obliterate them.

24. You shall not do obeisance to  their gods, nor shall you serve to them. You shall not do according to  their works; but by demolition you shall demolish them, and by breaking you shall break  their monuments.

25. And you shall serve to the lord  your God; and I will bless  your bread, and  your wine, and  your water; and I will turn infirmity from you.

26. It will not be barren nor sterile upon  your land; the number  of your days I will fill up.

27. And the fear of me I will send leading before you; and I will startle all the nations into which you enter into them; and I will give over all  your opponents unto exiles.

28. And I will send the swarms of wasps in front of you. And I will cast out the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites from you.

29. I will not cast them from your face in [2year 1one], that [3should not become 1the 2land] wilderness, and many [2should happen 3upon 4you  1wild beasts] in the land.

30. According to little by little I will cast them from you, until whenever you should grow and be heir to the land.

31. And I will establish  your boundaries from the red sea unto the sea of the Philistines; and from the wilderness unto the river of the great Euphrates. And I will deliver up into  your hands the ones lying in wait in the land; and I will cast them from you.

32. You shall not assent together with them, and with their gods  you shall not establish a covenant.

33. And they shall not lie in wait in  your land, lest [2you to sin 1they should cause] against me; for if you should be a slave to their gods, these will be to you an occasion for stumbling.  

## Exodus 24

1.  The Scroll of the Covenant And to Moses he said, Ascend to the lord, you and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel! And they shall do obeisance far off to the lord.

2. And Moses shall approach alone to  God, but they shall not approach, and the people shall not go up with them.

3. [3entered 1And 2Moses] and described to the people all the words  of God, and the ordinances. [5answered 1And 2all 3the 4people 7voice 6in one], saying, All the words which the lord spoke, we will do, and we will hearken.

4. And Moses wrote down all the words of the lord. [3rising early 1And 2Moses] in the morning built an altar by the mountain, and with twelve stones for the twelve tribes  of Israel.

5. And he sent out the young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered whole burnt-offerings, and they sacrificed a sacrifice of deliverance  to God -- of young calves.

6. [3taking 1And 2Moses]  half of the blood, poured it into a basin; and the other half of the blood he poured upon the altar.

7. And taking the scroll of the covenant, he read into the ears of the people. And they said, All as much as the lord spoke we shall do, and we shall hearken to.

8. [3taking 1And 2Moses] the blood, he scattered it upon the people, and said, Behold, the blood of the covenant of which the lord ordained for you concerning all  these words.

9. And Moses ascended and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.

10. And they saw the place where [4stood 1the 2God  3of Israel]. And the things under  his feet were as [2work 1a brick] of sapphire; and as the form of firmament of the heaven in the cleanliness.

11. And of the chosen ones  of Israel, none dissented -- not one. And they appeared in the place  of God, and ate and drank. 

12.  The Writing-tablets of Stone And the lord said to Moses, Ascend to me unto the mountain, and you be there! And I will give to you the [2writing-tablets  1stone] of the law, and the commandments which I wrote to establish law to them.

32. And [4shall eat 1Aaron 2and  3his sons] the meats of the ram, and the bread loaves that are in the bin by the door of the tent of the testimony.

33. They shall eat the offerings with which they were sanctified by them, to perfect  their hands, to sanctify them. And a foreigner shall not eat from them, for it is holy.

34. And if anything should be left behind from the meats of the sacrifice of the consecration, and of the bread loaves, until morning, you shall incinerate the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, [3sanctified 1for 2it is].

35. And you shall do for Aaron and  his sons thus according to all as much as I gave charge to you. Seven days you shall perfect  their hands.

36. And the young calf, the one of the sin offering, you shall offer in the day  of cleansing. And you shall cleanse the altar in  your sanctifying upon it. And you shall anoint it so as to sanctify it.

37. Seven days you shall cleanse the altar, and sanctify it. And [3will be 1the 2altar] a holy of the holies; all  touching the altar shall be sanctified.

38. And these are what you shall offer upon the altar -- lambs of a year old, unblemished, two for each day perpetually -- a yield offering of perpetuity.

39. The lamb -- the first one you shall offer in the morning, and the [2lamb  1second], you shall offer  at dusk.

40. And a tenth measure of fine flour being mixed with olive oil being beaten to the fourth part  of a hin; and a libation -- the fourth part of the hin of wine to the lamb -- to the first one.

41. And the lamb -- the second, you shall offer  at dusk, after the manner of the sacrifice -- the early morning, and according to  its libation you shall do it for a scented pleasant aroma, a yield offering to the lord;

42. [2sacrifice 1a perpetual] unto  your generations upon the doors of the tent of the testimony before the lord, in which I will be known to you there, so as to speak to you.

43. And I will give orders there to the sons of Israel, and I will be sanctified in my glory.

44. And I will sanctify the tent of the testimony, and the altar; and Aaron, and  his sons I will sanctify, to officiate as priests to me.

45. And I will be called upon by the sons of Israel, and I will be their God.

46. And they shall know that I am the lord  their God, the one leading them from out of the land of Egypt, to be called upon by them, and to be their God.  

## Exodus 30

1.  The Altar of Incense And you shall make an altar of incense from out of [2wood 1incorruptible].

2. And you shall make it a cubit  in length, and a cubit  in breadth -- four-cornered is shall be, and two cubits  in height; from out of it will be  its horns.

3. And you shall gild these [2gold 1in pure] --  its grates, and  its walls round about, and  its horns. And you shall make for it a twisted [2rim 1gold] round about.

4. And two rings [2gold 1of pure] for it you shall make under  [2twisted 3rim 1its] for the two corners. You shall make them on two sides, and they will be clips for the staves so as to lift it by them.

5. And you shall make staves from out of [2wood 1incorruptible], and you shall gild them in gold.

6. And you shall put it before the veil  being for the ark of the testimony, in which I shall be made known to you there.

7. And [2will burn incense 3upon 4it 1Aaron]; incense compounded fine -- in the morning by morning. Whenever he should trim the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

8. And whenever Aaron should ignite the lamps late, he shall burn incense upon it -- incense of perpetuity, continually before the lord unto  your generations.

9. And you shall not offer upon it [2incense 1another]. A yield offering, and a sacrifice offering, and a libation offering you shall not offer upon it.

10. And [2shall atone 1Aaron] upon  its horns once  a year. From the blood of the cleansing of sins of the making an atonement once  a year he shall cleanse it for  your generations; [2a holy  3of holies 1it is] to the lord. 

11.  The Sacred Double-drachma And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

12. If you should take the assessment of the sons of Israel in the overseeing of them, then [2shall give 1each] ransoms  for his soul to the lord, and there shall not be among them a failure in the overseeing of them.

13. And this is what they shall give, as many as pass the numbering -- the half  double-drachma, which it shall be according to the double-drachma  of the holy place -- twenty oboli to the double-drachma; but the half  double-drachma is a contribution to the lord.

14. Every one passing in the numbering from twenty years old and above shall give the contribution to the lord.

15. The ones being rich shall not add more, and the ones needing shall not add less from the half of the double-drachma in the giving the contribution to the lord to atone for  your souls.

16. And you shall take the silver of the contribution given by the sons of Israel, and you shall give it for the upkeep of the tent of the testimony. And it will be to the sons of Israel a memorial before the lord, to atone for  your souls. 

17.  The Brass Bathing Tub And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Make a bathing tub of brass, and a base for it of brass, so as to wash. And you shall put it between the tent of the testimony, and between the altar. And you shall pour into it water.

19. And [4shall wash 1Aaron 2and  3his sons] from it  their hands and  their feet.

20. Whenever they should enter into the tent of the testimony they shall wash in water, and no way shall they die. Or whenever they should go to the altar to officiate and to offer the whole burnt-offerings to the lord,

21. they shall wash their hands and  their feet in water, that they should not die. And it will be to them [2law 1an eternal], to him and  his generations after him. 

22.  The Sacred Oil for Anointing And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

23. And you take spices, the flower [2myrrh 1of choice] -- five hundred shekels, and [2cinnamon 1sweet smelling]  half of this -- two hundred and fifty, and [2calamus 1sweet smelling] -- two hundred fifty,

24. and of oil of cassia -- five hundred shekels of the holy place, and olive oil from olives -- a hin!

25. And you shall make it [3oil 2scented unguent 1a holy], a perfumed liquid scented by the craft of a perfumer -- [4oil 3scented unguent 2a holy 1it shall be].

26. And you shall anoint with it the tent of the testimony, and the ark of the testimony,

27. and all  its utensils, and the lamp-stand, and  its utensils, and the altar  of incense,

28. and the altar of the whole burnt-offerings, and all its  utensils, and the table, and all  its utensils, and the bathing tub, and  its base.

29. And you shall sanctify them. And they shall be a holy of the holies. Every  one touching them shall be sanctified.

30. And Aaron and  his sons you shall anoint, and you shall sanctify them to officiate as priests to me.

31. And to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, An oil of anointing -- [2anointing 1a holy] this will be to you into  your generations.

32. [2upon 3the flesh 4of man 1You shall not anoint with it]. And concerning  this composition, you shall not make any to you yourselves likewise -- it is holy, and it shall be sanctified to you.

33. Who ever should make likewise, and who ever should give of it to a foreigner, he shall be utterly destroyed from  his people. 

34.  The Incense And the lord said to Moses, Take to yourself spices -- balsam, and onycha, and [2galbanum 1luscious], and [2frankincense 1transparent], equal to equal it will be.

35. And they shall make with it [2incense 1scented], a work of a perfumer -- [4being mixed 1a pure 3work 2holy].

36. And you shall cut of these into fine parts, and you shall put it before the testimony in the tent of the testimony from where I will be known to you from there. [3a holy 4of the 5holies 1It will be 2to you] incense.

37. According to  this composition you shall not make to you yourselves -- it shall be a sanctified thing to you to the lord.

38. Who ever should make likewise so as to smell by it, he shall be destroyed from out of  his people.  

## Exodus 31

1.  Bezaleel Appointed Chief of Construction And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Behold, I have called by name  Bezaleel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.

3. And I filled him [2spirit 1a divine] of wisdom, and understanding, and higher knowledge, [2in 3every 4work 1to consider],

4. and to supervise construction; to work the gold, and the silver, and the brass, and the blue, and the purple and the [2scarlet  1spun],

5. and the linen  being twined, and the stonecutting works, and for the woodworkers of the works of wood -- to work according to all the works.

6. And I have given him even  Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And to every one discerning in heart I have given understanding. And they shall make all as much as I gave orders to you --

7. the tent of the testimony, and the ark of the covenant, and the atonement-seat, the one upon it, and the equipment of the tent,

8. and the altars, and the table, and all the utensils for it, and the [2lamp-stand  1pure], and all the utensils for it,

9. and the bathing tub, and  its base,

10. and the [2apparels  1ministry] of Aaron, and the apparels  of his sons in the officiating as priest to me,

11. and the [2oil  1anointing], and the incense of the composition of the holy place -- according to all as much as I gave charge to you they shall make. 

12.  The Sabbath And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

13. You also speak to the sons of Israel! saying, Perceive, and  [2my Sabbaths 1guard]! For it is a sign by me and among you unto  your generations, that you might know that I the lord am the one sanctifying you.

14. And you shall guard the Sabbath, for [2holy 1it is] to you. The one profaning it, unto death shall be put to death. Every one who shall do [2on 3it 1work], [2shall be utterly destroyed  1that soul] from the midst  of his people.

15. Six days you shall do works, but the [2day  1seventh 4Sabbath 5rest 3is a holy] to the lord. All who shall do work on the day of the Sabbaths shall be put to death.

16. And [4shall guard 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the Sabbaths to observe them unto  their generations.

17. [2covenant 1It is an eternal] with me and the sons of Israel, [3sign 1it is 2an eternal]. For in six days the lord made the heaven and the earth, and on the [2day  1seventh] he ceased and rested.

18. And he gave to Moses, when he rested from speaking to him in  mount  Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony -- tablets of stone, written by the finger  of God.  

## Exodus 32

1.  The Golden Calf And [3seeing 1the 2people] that Moses passed time to come down from out of the mountain, [3stood together 1the 2people] by Aaron, and they say to him, Rise up and make for us gods! the ones who will go before us.  For Moses, this  man who led us from out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.

2. And [2says 3to them 1Aaron], Remove the [2ear-rings  1gold]! the ones in the ears  of your wives, and  daughters; and bring them to me!

3. And [4removed 1all 2the 3people 4the 6ear-rings  5gold], the ones in  their ears, and they brought them to Aaron.

4. And he took them from out of  their hands, and he shaped them with the stylus. And he made it [2calf 1a molten]. And they said, These are  your gods, O Israel, who hauled you from out of the land of Egypt.

5. And seeing, Aaron built an altar over against it. And Aaron proclaimed, saying, A holiday of the lord is tomorrow.

6. And rising early in the next day, he offered whole burnt-offerings, and he offered the sacrifice of deliverance. And [3sat 1the 2people] to eat and to drink, and they rose up to play.

7. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying, Proceed  quickly! to go down from here, [3acted lawlessly 1for  2your people], whom you led from the land of Egypt.

8. They violate quickly from the way which I gave charge to them; they made to themselves a calf, and they do obeisance to it, and they have sacrificed to it. And they said, These are  your gods, O Israel, who hauled you from the land of Egypt.

9. And now allow me! for being enraged in anger against them, I will obliterate them.

10. And I will make you into [2nation 1a great].

11. And Moses beseeched in front of the lord  God, and said, Why, O lord, be enraged in anger against  your people, whom you led from out of the land of Egypt in [2strength 1great], and with  [3arm 1your  2high]?

12. lest at any time [3should say 1the 2Egyptians], in saying, With wickedness he led them to kill them in the mountains, and to completely consume them from the earth. Cease in the anger  of your rage, and [2propitious 1be] to the evil  of your people!

13. remembering Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob  your servants, to whom you swore by an oath to them according to yourself. And you spoke to them, saying, I will greatly multiply  your seed as the stars of the heaven  in multitude, and all  this land which you spoke of to give it to their seed, so that they shall hold it into the eon.

14. And the lord dealt kindly concerning the bad which he said he would do to  his people.

15. And Moses returning, went down from the mountain along with the two tablets of the testimony in  his hands -- tablets of stone, having been written on both  their parts; on this side and that side they were written.

16. And the tablets [2a work 3of God 1were], and the writing, [2a writing 3of God 1is] chiseled in the tablets.

17. And Joshua hearing the voice of the people crying out, says to Moses, It is a sound of war in the camp.

18. And he says, It is not a sound originating from strength, nor a sound originating by a routing of the enemy, but a sound originating from wine I hear.

19. And when he approached the camp, he sees the calf and the company of dancers. And [2being provoked to anger 3in rage 1Moses] tossed from  his hands the two tablets, and he broke them below the mountain.

20. And having taken the calf which they made, he incinerated it in fire, and ground it fine, and sowed it upon the water, and made [4drink 5it 1the 2sons 3of Israel].

21. And Moses said to Aaron, What did [2do 3to you  1this people] that you brought upon them [2sin 1a great]?

22. And Aaron said to Moses, Be not provoked to anger, O master! for you know the impulse  of this people.

23. For they say to me, Make us gods! which shall go before us,  for [3Moses 1this  2man], who led us out of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.

24. And I said to them, Anyone who possesses pieces of gold, remove them! And they gave them to me, and I tossed them into the fire, and there came forth  this calf.

25. And Moses seeing the people, that they have been dispersed, [3dispersed 1for 4them 2Aaron] to be a derision to their opponents.

26. Moses stood at the gate of the camp, and he said, Who is for the lord? Come to me! [6came together 1Then 7to 8him 2all 3the 4sons 5of Levi].

27. And he says to them, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, Let [2put 1each]  on himself a broadsword upon his thigh! And let him go through and return from gate to gate through the camp! and let [2kill 1each]  his brethren, and each  his neighbor, and each the one nearest him!

28. And [4did 1the 2sons 3of Levi] as [2said 3to them 1Moses]. And there fell of the people in  that day three thousand males.

29. And [2said 3to them 1Moses], You filled  your hands today to the lord; each one on  his brother, and his son, to give upon you a blessing.

30. And it came to pass after the next morning, Moses said to the people, You have sinned [2sin 1a great]. And now I will ascend to  God, that I might make atonement on account of  your sin.

31. [3returned 1And 2Moses] to the lord, and said, I beseech O lord, [2have sinned  1this people 4sin 3a great], and made to themselves golden gods.

32. And now, if forasmuch as you forgive them  of their sin -- forgive! But if not, wipe me away from out of  your book of which you wrote!

33. And the lord said to Moses, If any sin before me, I will wipe them from out of  my book.

34. And now, proceed, and guide  this people into the place which I told to you! Behold,  my angel shall go forth before your face, and in whatever day I should visit, I will bring upon them  their sin.

35. And the lord struck the people on account of the making of the calf, which Aaron made.  

## Exodus 33

1.  The LORD Talks to Moses And the lord said to Moses, Go forth, ascend from here, you and  your people! whom you led from out of the land of Egypt, into the land which I swore by an oath to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it.

2. And I will send along  my angel before your face; and he will cast out the Amorite, and Hittite, and Perizzite, and Gergesite, and Hivite, and Jebusite, and Canaanite.

3. And I will bring you into a land flowing milk and honey. [3not 1For 2I will] go up with you, because   [4people 3a hard-necked 1you 2are], that I should not completely consume you in the way.

4. And [3hearing 1the 2people  5saying  4this severe], mourned in mourning.

5. And the lord said to the sons of Israel, You are a people hard-necked; see that [2do not 5calamity 4another 1I 3bring] upon you! and should completely consume you. Now then remove  [2apparels  1your glorious], and the ornament! and I will show to you what I will do to you.

6. And [4removed 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  their ornamentation, and the attire at the mountain  of Horeb.

7. And Moses, taking  his tent, pitched outside the camp far from the camp. And it was called -- Tent  of Testimony. And it came to pass, all the ones seeking the lord went forth unto the tent outside the camp.

8. And whenever Moses entered into the tent outside the camp, [4stood 1all 2the 3people] watching, each one by the door  of his tent. And they contemplated Moses' going away unto  his entering into the tent.

9. And as Moses entered into the tent, [4came down 1the 2column  3of cloud] and stood at the door of the tent, and he spoke to Moses.

10. And [4saw 1all 2the 3people] the column  of cloud standing by the door of the tent. And [4stood 1all 2the 3people]. And they did obeisance, each from the door  of his tent.

11. And the lord spoke to Moses face to face, as if any might speak to  his own friend. And he retired into the camp. And the attendant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, did not go forth from out of the tent.

12. And Moses said to the lord, Behold, you say to me, Lead  this people! But you manifested not to me whom you shall send along with me. But you said to me, I know you above all, and [2favor 1you have] with me.

13. If then I have found favor before you, reveal to me yourself knowingly! that I might see you, how ever I should be found in favor before you; and that I might know, that [2is your people  1this nation].

14. And he says, I myself will go before you, and will rest you.

15. And he says to him, Unless you yourself should go with us, [2not 4me 1you should 3lead] from here.

16. And how [3be made known 1will it 2truly] that I have found favor by you -- I and also  your people, unless you are going with us, and [4will be glorified 1both I 2and  3your people] by all the nations, as many as [2upon 3the 4earth 1are]?

17. [3said 1And 2the lord] to Moses, And this [5to you  1word 2which 3you have said 4I will do], for you have found favor before me, and I know you above all. 

18.  The Glory of The LORD Shown to Moses And he says, Show to me  your own glory!

19. And he said, I will go by in front of you in my glory; and I will call the name, the lord, before you; and I will show mercy on whom ever I should show mercy, and I will pity whom ever I should pity.

20. And he said, You will not be able to see  my face, for not in any way may [2see 1man]  my face, and shall live.

21. And the lord said, Behold, a place by me. And you shall stand upon the rock;

22. and when ever [2should go by  1my glory], even I will put you into an opening in the rock, and I will shelter with my hand upon you until whenever I should go by.

23. And I shall remove the hand, and then you shall see the rear of me,  but my face will not appear to you.  

## Exodus 34

1.  The Second Set of Tablets And the lord said to Moses, Dress to yourself two tablets of stone, as also the first, and ascend to me into the mountain! and I will write upon the tablets the words which were upon the [2tablets  1first], which you broke.

2. And come prepared in the morning! and you shall ascend upon  mount  Sinai, and you shall stand there to me upon the tip of the mountain.

3. And let no one ascend with you, nor appear in all the mountain! And the sheep and the oxen let them not feed neighboring  that mountain!

4. And he dressed two tablets of stone, just as also the first. And Moses rising early in the morning ascended unto  mount  Sinai, in so far as [2ordered 3him 1the lord]. And Moses took with himself the two tablets, the ones of stone.

5. And the lord came down in a cloud, and stood beside him there. And he called by the name of the lord.

6. And the lord went by before his face, and called out, The lord, The lord  God, pitying and merciful, lenient and full of mercy and true,

7. and [2righteousness 1observing], and doing mercy for thousands, removing lawlessnesses, and iniquities, and sins; and the ones liable he will not cleanse; bringing the lawlessnesses of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children of the children, unto the third and fourth generation.

8. And Moses hastening, bowing upon the earth, did obeisance.

9. And he said, If I have found favor before you, let [2go  1my lord] with us! [2the 3people 1For] are hard-necked. And you shall remove the sins, and  our lawless deeds, and we will be yours. 

10.  The LORD Establishes a Covenant And the lord said to Moses, Behold, I establish with you a covenant before all  your people. And I will do honorable, which has not happened in all the earth, and with any nation. And [7shall see 1all 2the 3people 4among 5whom 6you are] the works of the lord, for it is wonderful what I will do for you.

11. You heed all as much as I give charge to you! Behold, I cast out before your face the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Gergesite, and the Jebusite.

12. Take heed to yourself! lest at any time you should establish a covenant with the ones lying in wait upon the land, into which you enter into it, lest at any time it become an occasion of stumbling to you.

13.  Their shrines you shall demolish, and  their monuments you shall break, and  their sacred groves you shall cut down, and the carvings  of their gods you shall incinerate in fire.

14.  For you should not do obeisance to other gods.  For the lord  God, a jealous name, [2God 1is a jealous];

15. lest at any time you should establish a covenant with the ones lying in wait upon the land, and they should fornicate after  their gods, and should sacrifice to their gods, and they should call you, and you should eat  of their sacrifices;

16. and you should take  of their daughters to your sons, and  of your daughters you should give to their sons; and [2should fornicate  1your daughters] after  their gods, and [2will fornicate  1your sons] after  their gods.

17. And [4gods 3molten 1you shall not make 2to yourself]. 

18.  Concerning the Holidays And the holiday of the unleavened breads you shall guard; seven days you shall eat unleavened breads, just as I gave charge to you, at the time in the month of the new produce. For in the month of the new produce you came forth out of Egypt.

19. All opening wide the womb -- to me are the males; first-born of the calf, and of the sheep.

20. And a first-born beast of burden you shall ransom with a sheep. But if you will not ransom it, [2value 1you shall give] for it. Every first-born  of your sons you shall ransom. You shall not appear before me empty.

21. Six days you shall work, but the [2day  1seventh] you shall rest -- in the sowing and in the harvest you shall rest.

22. And a holiday of a period of sevens you shall observe to me, the beginning of the harvest of wheat, and a holiday gathering being in the middle of the year.

23. Three times of the year [4shall appear 1every 2male 3of yours] before the lord  God of Israel.

24. For whenever I shall cast out the nations from your face, and I widen  your borders,  [2shall desire 1no one]  your land, when ever you ascend to appear before the lord  your God three times  a year.

25. You shall not slay [3with 4yeast 1the blood 2of my sacrifices]; and [2shall not remain through the night 3into 4 the morning 1that which is offered in sacrifices] for the holiday of the passover.

26. The first produce  of your land you shall carry into the house of the lord  your God. You shall not boil a lamb in the milk of its mother.

27. And the lord said to Moses, Write to yourself  these words! for upon  these words I have established to you a covenant, and to Israel.

28. And [2was 3there 1Moses] before the lord forty days and forty nights. Bread he did not eat, and water he did not drink. And he wrote upon the tablets  these words of the covenant -- the ten words. 

29.  The Face of Moses Glorified And as Moses went down from  mount Sinai, even the two tablets were upon the hands of Moses. [3going down 1And 2in his] from the mountain, even Moses did not know that [6was glorified 1the 2appearance 3of the 4complexion  5of his face] in  his speaking to him.

30. And [7saw 1Aaron 2and 3all 4the 5sons 6of Israel]  Moses; and he was being glorified in the appearance of the complexion  of his face. And they feared to approach him.

31. And [2called 3them 1Moses]; and [2turned 3towards 4him 1Aaron] and all the rulers of the congregation. And [2spoke 3to them 1Moses].

32. And after these things came forward to him all the sons of Israel. And he gave charge to them all as much as the lord spoke to him on  mount Sinai.

33. And as soon as he rested speaking to them, he placed upon  his face a covering.

34. And when ever Moses entered before the lord to speak to him, he removed the covering until  exiting. And going forth he spoke to all the sons of Israel, as much as [2gave charge 3to him 1the lord].

35. And [4saw 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the face of Moses, that it was glorified; and Moses put the covering upon  his face until whenever he entered to converse together with him.  

## Exodus 35

1.  The Choice-portion Offerings And Moses gathered together all the congregation of the sons of Israel. And he said to them, These are the words which the lord told them to do.

2. Six days you shall do works, but on the [2day  1seventh] you shall rest a holy Sabbath rest to the lord; every one  doing work on it -- let him come to an end.

3. You shall not burn a fire in any place  of your house on the day of the Sabbaths -- I am the lord.

4. And Moses said to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the saying which the lord ordered, saying,

5. Take from yourselves of them -- a choice-portion to the lord. Every one  appreciating in his heart shall bring the first-fruits to the lord -- gold, silver, brass,

6. blue, purple, scarlet [2double 1being spun], and linen being twined, and hair of goats,

7. and skins of rams dyed red, and skins of blue, and [2wood 1incorruptible],

8. and oil for the giving light, and incense for the oil of the anointing, and for the compound of the incense,

9. and stones of sardius, and stones for the carving for the shoulder-piece and for the oracle.

27. And he burned incense upon it, the incense of the composition, just as the lord gave orders to Moses.

28. And he placed the draw curtain of the door of the tent.

29. And the altar of the yield offerings he put by the door of the tent of the testimony. And he offered on it a whole burnt-offering, and a sacrifice offering, as [2gave orders 1the lord] to Moses.

30. And he put the bathing tub between the tent of the testimony, and between the altar. And he placed [2in 3it 1water]

31. for [6to wash 7from 8it 1Moses 2and 3Aaron 4and  5his sons]  their hands and  feet,

32. in their entering into the tent of the testimony; or whenever they went to the altar to officiate, they washed from it, as the lord gave orders to Moses.

33. And he set up the courtyard round about the tent and the testimony, and he stationed the draw curtain of the door of the courtyard. And Moses completed all the works. 

34.  The Glory of The LORD Fills the Tent And [3covered 1the 2cloud] the tent of the testimony, and [4of the glory 5of the lord 3was filled 1the 2tent].

35. And [2was not able 1Moses] to enter into the tent of the testimony, for [3overshadowed 4upon 5it 1the 2cloud], and [4of the glory 5of the lord 3was filled 1the 2tent].

36. And when ever [3ascended 1the 2cloud] from the tent, [4broke camp 1the 2sons 3of Israel] with  their chattel.

37. But if [3ascends not 1the 2cloud], they did not break camp till the day which [3ascended 1the 2cloud].

38. For the cloud was upon the tent by day, and fire was upon it by night, before all Israel, in all  their marchings.
