# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1.  Chosen Before the Foundation of the World Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, to the holy ones, to the ones being in Ephesus and believers in Christ Jesus.

2. Favor to you and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed be the God and father  of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one having blessed us with every [2blessing 1spiritual] in the heavenlies in Christ;

4. as he chose us in him before the founding of the world, for us to be holy and unblemished before him in love.

5. Having predefined us for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good-pleasure  of his will,

6. in high praise of the glory  of his favor, in which he showed favor on us by the one being loved;

7. by whom we have the release by ransom through  his blood, the release  of transgressions, according to the riches  of his favor,

8. which he abounded in us in all wisdom and intelligence,

9. having made known to us the mystery  of his will, according to  his good-pleasure, which he purposed in him,

10. for administration of the fullness of the times, recapitulating  all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in himself.

11. In whom also we were chosen by lot, being predefined according to the intention of the one [2all things 1operating] according to the counsel  of his will,

12. for  us to be in high praise  of his glory, of the ones hoping earlier in the Christ. 

13.  Sealed by The Spirit of the Promise In whom also you, having heard the word of the truth the good news  of your deliverance -- in whom also having trusted, you were sealed by the spirit of the promise in the holy;

14. who is the deposit  of our inheritance, in a release by ransom of the procurement in high praise  of his glory.

15. Because of this, I also having heard the [2among you 1belief] in the Lord Jesus, and the love, the one towards all the holy ones,

16. cease not giving thanks for you, [2mention 3of you 1making] in  my prayers,

17. that the God  of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father  of glory, should give [3to you 1spirit 2of wisdom] and revelation in full knowledge of him,

18. giving light of the eyes  of your thought, for  you to know what is the hope  of his calling, and what the riches of the glory  of his inheritance is in the holy ones,

19. and what the exceeding greatness  of his power in us the ones believing, according to the energy of the might  of his strength,

20. which he operated in the Christ, having raised him from the dead, and seated him at his right hand in the heavenlies,

21. above every sovereignty and authority, and power and lordship, and every name named, not only in  this eon, but also in the one about to be.

22. And all things he submitted under  his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly,

23. which is  his body, the fullness of the [2all things 3in 4all 1one fulfilling].  

## Ephesians 2

1.  Alive in Christ And you being dead  in transgressions and  sins,

2. in which at one time you walked according to the eon  of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit of the one now operating in the sons  of disobedience;

3. among whom also we all behaved at some time or other, in the desires  of our flesh, doing the wants of the flesh and the thoughts; and we were children by nature of wrath, as even the rest.

4. But the God being rich in mercy through the great love of his, which he loved us,

5. and we being dead in the transgressions, are made alive together in the Christ (by favor you are being delivered),

6. and raised up together, and seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,

7. that he should demonstrate in the eons, in the ones coming, the exceeding riches  of his favor, in graciousness upon us in Christ Jesus.

8.  For by favor you are being preserved through the belief; and this [3is not 4of 5you 2of God  1gift];

9. not of works, lest any should boast. 

10.  Created for Good Works [4by him 1For 2we are 3a thing made], being created in Christ Jesus for [2works 1good], the ones whom God prepared beforehand, that in them we should walk.

11. Therefore remember that you at some time or other, the nations in the flesh, the ones being called the uncircumcision by the one being called the circumcision in the flesh made by hand,

12. that you were in  that time separate from Christ, being separate of the citizenship  of Israel, and strangers of the covenants of the promise, [3hope 1not 2having], and atheists in the world!

13. But now in Christ Jesus, you, the ones at some time or other being far off, [2near 1became] by the blood of the Christ.

14. For he is  our peace, the one having made  both one, and [2the 3partition 4of the 5barrier 1having loosed];

15. the enmity [7by  8his flesh 1of the 2law  3of commandments 4in 5decrees 6he cleared away], that the two he should create in himself into one new man, making peace;

16. and should reconcile  both in one body  to God through the cross, having killed the enmity by it.

17. And having come to announce good news of peace to you, to the ones far and to the ones near;

18. that through him we [2have  3access  1both] by one spirit to the father.

19. So then, no longer are you strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens of the holy ones, and members of the family  of God;

20. being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, [4being 5the one cornering 3himself 1Jesus 2Christ],

21. in whom every construction fits together to grow into [2temple 1a holy] in the Lord;

22. in whom also you are being built up together for a home  of God in spirit.  

## Ephesians 3

1.  The Mystery of Christ Revealed For this favor, I Paul, the prisoner of the Christ Jesus, for of you of the nations,

2. if indeed you heard the administration of the favor  of God  having been given to me towards you,

3. that by revelation he made known to me the mystery (as I wrote beforehand a little,

4. to which you are able reading to comprehend  my understanding in the mystery of the Christ),

5. which unto other generations was not made known to the sons  of men, as now it was revealed to [2holy 3apostles 1his] and prophets in spirit;

6. [3to be 1for the 2nations] joint-heirs, and joint-bodies, and joint-partners,  of his promise in the Christ through the good news,

7. of which I became servant according to the gift of the favor  of God, the one given to me according to the energy  of his power.

8. To me the less than the least of all of the holy ones, was given  this favor among the nations to announce good news -- the untraceable riches of the Christ,

9. and to enlighten all as to what is the fellowship of the mystery of the thing being concealed from the eons by  God, to the one [2all things 1having created] through Jesus Christ,

10. that should be made known now to the sovereignties and to the authorities among the heavenlies through the assembly, the multifarious wisdom  of God,

11. according to the intention of the eons, which he made in Christ Jesus  our Lord;

12. in whom we have  an open manner and  access in reliance through the belief of his.

13. Therefore I ask not to tire in  my afflictions for you, which is your glory.

14. For this favor I bend  my knees to the father  of our Lord Jesus Christ,

15. of whom every family in the heavens and upon earth is named,

16. that he should give to you according to the riches  of his glory, power to be fortified through  his spirit, in the inside man;

17. [3to dwell 1for the 2Christ] through the belief in  your hearts, in love being rooted and founded;

18. that you should be competent to perceive with all the holy ones, what is the width and length and depth and height;

19. and to know [5which 6exceeds 1the 7knowledge 2love 3of the 4Christ], that you should be filled in all the fullness  of God.

20. And to the one being able above all to do superabundantly what we ask or comprehend, according to the power  operating in us,

21. to him be the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the eon of the eons. Amen.  

## Ephesians 4

1.  Walk Worthy of the Calling I appeal then to you, I the prisoner in the Lord, [2worthily 1to walk] of the calling of which you were called,

2. with all humility and gentleness, with leniency, enduring one another in love;

3. hurrying to keep the unity of the spirit in the bonding together  of peace.

4. One body, and one spirit, as also you were called in one hope  of your calling.

5. One Lord, one belief, one immersion;

6. one God and father of all, the one over all, and through all, and in you all. 

7.  Gifts to the Saints [3one 1And 2in each] of us was given the favor according to the measure of the gift of the Christ.

8. Therefore he says, Having ascended into the height he captured the captivity, and he gave gifts  to men.

9. And the one that ascended, what is it unless that also he came down first unto the lower parts of the earth?

10. The one having come down, he is also the one having ascended up above all the heavens, that he should fulfill all things.

11. And he gave some indeed for apostles,  and some prophets,  and some evangelists;  but some shepherds and teachers,

12. for the readying of the holy ones for a work of service, for edification of the body of the Christ;

13. until we should [2arrive  1all] in the unity of the belief, and of the full knowledge of the son  of God, in [2man 1a perfect], in the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ;

14. that no longer should we be infants, being swelled and carried round about by every wind of the instruction, in the cunning  of men, in cleverness to the craft of the delusion.

15. But being truthful in love, we should grow in him in all things, which is the head -- the Christ;

16. from whom all the body being fitted together, and being instructed by every ligament  of supply, according to energy in measure [2one 1of each] part, the growth of the body to produce for itself to the construction of itself in love. 

17.  Be Renewed in the Spirit of Your Mind This then I say and testify in the Lord, for you to no longer walk as also the rest of the nations walk, in the folly  of their mind,

18. being darkened in the mind, being separated from the life  of God, through the ignorance  being in them, through the callousness  of their heart;

19. ones who being numbed, delivered themselves up to lewdness, for a work of all uncleanness in a desire for wealth.

20. But you [2not 3thus 1learned] the Christ,

21. if indeed you heard him, and [2in 3him 1were taught], as truth is in  Jesus;

22. for you to put aside according to the former behavior, the old man, the one being corrupt according to the desires of the deception;

23. and to be renewed in the spirit  of your mind;

24. and to put on the new man, the one according to God being created in righteousness and sacredness of the truth.

25. Therefore having put aside the lie, let [2speak 3truth 1each] with  his neighbor! for we are [2of one another 1members].

26. Be angry and do not sin! [3the 4sun 1Do not 2let] set upon the provocation to your anger!

27. nor give place to the devil!

28. The one stealing no longer let him steal! but rather let him tire working what is good with the hands! that he should have something to share with the one [2need 1having].

29. Every [2word 1rotten] from out of  your mouth, let it not go forth! but if any good word for edification for the need, let it go forth so that it should give favor to the ones hearing.

30. And do not fret the [2spirit  1holy]  of God, in which you were sealed for the day of release by ransom!

31. All bitterness, and rage, and anger, and roaring, and blasphemy take away from you with all evil!

32. And be to one another gracious, compassionate, granting to each other, as also  God granted to us in Christ!  

## Ephesians 5

1.  Become Mimics of God Become then mimics  of God, as [2children 1beloved]!

2. And walk in love! as also the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us an offering and sacrifice  to God for a scent of pleasant aroma.

3. And harlotry and all uncleanness or desire for wealth let not be named among you! as it is becoming to holy ones;

4. and indecency and moronish talking, or obscene jokes  not relating -- but rather thankfulness.

5. For this you are knowing, that every fornicator, or unclean, or a hoarder of wealth, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.

6. [2not one 3of you 1Let] be deceived with empty words! [2on account of 3these things 1for] comes the wrath  of God upon the sons  of disobedience.

7. Do not then become joint-partners with them!

8. For you were at some time or other darkness, but now light in the Lord -- [2as 3children 4of light 1walk]!

9. (For the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),

10. distinguishing what is well-pleasing to the Lord.

11. And do not partake together with the [2works  1unfruitful]  of darkness, but rather also reprove!

12. For the things secretly taking place by them, it is shameful even to speak.

13. But all being reproved, [2by 3the 4light 1are made manifest]; [4all things 1for 2the thing 3manifesting] is light.

14. Therefore he says, Arise, O sleeping one, and rise up from the dead! and [3shall shine upon 4you 1the 2Christ].

15. Take heed then how exactly you walk! not as unwise, but as wise,

16. buying back the time, for the days are wicked.

17. On account of this do not become fools, but be perceiving what the will of the Lord is!

18. And be not intoxicated with wine in which is carnality! but be filled in spirit!

19. speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and [2odes 1spiritual]; singing and strumming in  your heart to the Lord;

20. giving thanks at all times for all things in the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and father; 

21.  Concerning Submission being submitted to one another in a fear of God.

22. [2the 3wives 5to their 6own 7husbands 1Let 4submit], as to the Lord!

23. For the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ is head of the assembly, and he is deliverer of the body.

24. But as the assembly submits to the Christ, so also the wives to their own husbands in all things.

25. [2the 3husbands 1Let] love  their own wives, as also the Christ loved the assembly, and delivered himself up for it;

26. that he should sanctify it, having cleansed it by the bath  of water by the word;

27. that he should present it to himself [2honorable 1the 3assembly], not having stain, or wrinkle, or any  such things; but that it should be holy and unblemished.

28. So ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one loving his own wife, loves himself.

29. For no one at some time or other  [2his own 3flesh 1detests], but nourishes and comforts it, as also the Lord for the assembly.

30. For we are members  of his body, of  his flesh, and of  his bones.

31. For of this [2leaves behind 1a man]  his father and  mother, and cleaves to  his wife, and [3will be 1the 2two] for [2flesh 1one].

32.  This mystery is great; and I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly.

33. Only also you, everyone, [3each  5his own 6wife 1so 2let 4love] as himself, and the wife, that she should fear the husband!  

## Ephesians 6

1.  Concerning Family Relationships The Children -- obey  your parents in the Lord, for this is just!

2. Esteem  your father and  mother, which is the first commandment in promise,

3. that [2good 3to you 1it should be], and you will be a long time upon the earth.

4. And the fathers -- do not provoke to anger  your children, but nourish them in instruction and admonition of the Lord!

5. The bondmen -- obey the masters according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity  of your heart, as to the Christ;

6. not according to eyeservice, as ones who try to please men, but as bondmen of the Christ, doing the will  of God from the soul,

7. with good-will serving as to the Lord, and not to men;

8. knowing that what ever any [2each 3should do 1good], this he shall carry from the Lord, whether bondman or whether free.

9. And the masters -- [2the 3same things 1do] to them! sparing  intimidation, knowing that also your own  master is in heavens, and [3discrimination 2no 1there is] with him. 

10.  The Full Armor of God For the rest, my brethren, be empowered in the Lord, and in the might  of his strength!

11. Put on the full armor  of God! for  you to be able to stand against the craft of the devil.

12. For [3is not 4to us 1the 2wrestling] against blood and flesh, but against the sovereignties, against the authorities, against the world rulers of the darkness  of this eon, against the spirituals of the wickedness in the heavenlies.

13. On account of this take up the full armor  of God! that you should be able to oppose in the [2day  1wicked], and all things being worked out, to stand.

14. Stand then! girding  your loin in truth, and putting on the chest plate  of righteousness,

15. and having sandals tied on the feet in preparation of the good news  of peace.

16. With all having taken up the shield of the belief, in which you shall be able [2all 3the 4arrows 5of the 6wicked one  7being setting on fire 1to extinguish];

17. and [2the 3helmet  4of deliverance 1receive], and the sword of the spirit! which is [2word 1God's]. 

18.  Prayer and Supplication Through all prayer and supplication praying at every time in spirit, and in this same thing being sleepless with all attention, and supplication for all the holy ones;

19. and for me, that to me should be given a word in opening  my mouth in an open manner to make known the mystery of the good news,

20. for which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I should speak openly as necessary for me to speak.

21. But that [3should know 2also 1you] the things concerning me, what I am doing -- all things [2to you 1will be made known] by Tychicus the beloved brother and trustworthy servant in the Lord,

22. whom I sent forth to you for this very same thing, that you should know the things concerning us, and he should comfort  your hearts.

23. Peace to the brethren, and love with belief from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

24.  Favor be with all the ones loving  our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility. Amen.
