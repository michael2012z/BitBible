## 1 Samuel 1

1.  Hannah's Affliction And there was [2man 1one] from Ramathaim Zophim of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son Zuph from mount Ephraim.

2. And to this one was two wives; the name to the one was Hannah, and the name to the second was Peninnah. And there was  to Peninnah a child, and  to Hannah there was no child.

3. And [3ascended  2man 1that] from days to days from out of his city of Ramathaim to do obeisance and to sacrifice to the lord of Hosts in Shiloh. And [2there 1was] Eli and  [2two 3sons 1his], Hophni and Phinehas, priests of the lord.

4. And came to pass a day that Elkanah sacrificed, and he gave  to Peninnah his wife, and to all  her sons, and to her daughters, portions.

5. And  to Hannah he gave [2portion 1one], for there was no child to her; except that  [2loved Hannah 1Elkanah] above Peninnah. But the lord locked the matter concerning  her womb.

6. And [2provoked her to anger  1her rival], and even a provocation to anger because of the treating her with contempt, for the lord closed up the matters concerning  her womb  to not give to her a child.

7. Thus she did year by year in  her ascending unto the house of the lord; and she was depressed, and she wept, and did not eat.

8. And [3said 4to her 1Elkanah  2her husband], Hannah, what is it to you that you weep? And why do you not eat? And why does [2beat 3you  1your heart]? [2not 3good 1Am I] to you over ten children?

9. And Hannah rose up after  their eating in Shiloh, and after  drinking. And Eli the priest sat upon the chair at the doorposts of the temple of the lord.

10. And she was in severe pain of soul, and she prayed to the lord, and with weeping she wept.

11. And she vowed a vow, saying, O lord of hosts, if looking you should look upon the humiliation  of your maidservant, and should remember me, and should not forget  your maidservant, and should give to your maidservant seed of a male, then I will put him before you, dedicated until the day of his death. And an iron razor shall not ascend upon  his head.

12. And it came to pass when she multiplied praying before the lord, that Eli the priest watched  her mouth.

13. And she spoke in  her heart, and  her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. And [2considered 3her 1Eli] to be intoxicated.

14. And [2said 3to her 1Eli], Until when shall you be intoxicated? Remove  your wine!

15. And Hannah answered and said, No, O master, [3a woman 4with 5a hard 6day 1I 2am], and wine and strong drink I have not drunk, and I pour out  my soul before the lord.

16. You should not grant  your maidservant for [2daughter 1mischievous]. For from the amount of my meditation, and from the amount of my depression, I have been stretched out until the present.

17. And Eli answered and said to her, Go in peace! The God of Israel will give to you all your request which you asked of him.

18. And she said, [2found  1Your maidservant] favor in your eyes. And [3went 1the 2woman]  her way, and ate with  her husband, and drank, and  her face was not downcast any longer.

19. And they rose early in the morning, and did obeisance to the lord, and they went  their way. And Elkanah entered unto  his house in Ramah, and he knew Hannah his wife; and [2remembered 3her 1the lord], and she conceived. 

20.  The Birth of Samuel And it came to pass in the time of the days, that Hannah bore a son, and she called  his name Samuel, saying that, From the lord almighty I asked him.

21. And [4ascended 1the 2man 3Elkanah], and all  his house, to sacrifice in Shiloh, for the sacrifice of the days, and  his vows.

22. And Hannah did not ascend with him, for she said to her husband, I will wait until the ascending of the boy, whenever I should have weaned it, and he shall appear  in front of the lord, and he shall settle there unto the eon.

23. And [3said 4to her 1Elkanah  2her husband], You do the good thing in your eyes, sit until whenever you should wean it! Only may the lord establish the thing coming forth from out of  your mouth. And [3sat 1the 2woman], and nursed  her son until whenever she weaned him.

24. And she ascended with him unto Shiloh with a calf being three years old, and an ephah of fine flour, and a skin flask of wine. And she entered into the house of the lord in Shiloh, and the boy with them.

25. And they led him before the lord, and they slew the calf. And [6brought it 1Hannah 2the 3mother 4of the 5boy] to Eli.

26. And she said, By me, O master, [2should live  1your soul]; I am the woman  standing before you with you while  praying to the lord.

27. Over  this boy I prayed, and [2gave 3to me 1the lord]  my request which I asked of him.

28. And I lend him to the lord all the days which he should live for use by the lord.  

## 1 Samuel 2

1.  Hannah's Praise And Hannah prayed and said, [2is solidified  1My heart] in the lord; [2was raised high 1my horn] by my God; [2was widened 3over 4my enemies  1my mouth]; for I was glad in your deliverance.

2. For there is no one holy as the lord; and there is no just one as  our God; and there is no holy one besides you.

3. Do not boast, and do not speak high things in superiority! Let not come forth lofty language from out of  your mouth! For [2is a God 3of knowledge 1the lord], and God is preparing his practices.

4. The bow of the mighty is weakened, and the ones being weakened girded on power.

5. The ones full of bread loaves are made less; and the ones hungering disregarded the land; for the sterile gave birth to seven, and the one with many in children weakened.

6. The lord puts to death, and he brings forth alive; he leads them down into Hades, and he leads up.

7. The lord makes poor, and he enriches; he humbles, and elevates.

8. He raises up from the earth the needy, and from the dung he raises the poor  to seat him with mighty ones of the people, and [3a throne 4of glory 1inheriting 2to them];

9. giving the thing vowed for to the one vowing. And he blessed the years of the just; for not by strength is man able.

10. The lord [3weak 1shall make 2his opponent]. The lord is holy. The lord ascended into heavens, and he thundered. He shall judge the extremities of the earth being just; and he shall give strength to our kings, and he will raise up high the horn of his anointed one.

11. And they went forth unto Ramah unto  their house. And the boy was officiating to the lord before the face of Eli the priest. 

12.  Eli's Wicked Sons And the sons of Eli the priest [2sons 1were mischievous], not knowing the lord.

13. And the ordinance of the priest of [2the 3people 1all] of the one sacrificing was this; that [5came 1the 2servant 3of the 4priest] when ever [3boiled 1the 2meat], and [4meat hook 3was a three-pronged 1in  2his hand].

14. And he stuck it into the [2kettle  1great], or into the brass caldron, or into the earthen pot; and all, what ever ascended on the meat hook [3took 4to himself 1the 2priest]. According to thus they did to all Israel in Shiloh to the ones coming to sacrifice to the lord.

15. And before the burning the fat, [5would come 1the 2servant 3of the 4priest]. And he said to the man  sacrificing, Give meat [3to roast 1to the 2priest]; for in no way shall I take meat from you cooked from out of the kettle.

16. And if [5said 1the 2man 3who was 4sacrificing], [2let there be burnt 1first] as is fit for the fat, and then you shall take for yourself from all what [2desires  1your soul]. Then he said, No, but now you shall give it; and if not, I will take it forcefully.

17. And [5was 1the 2sin 3of the 4young men] great before the lord, exceedingly, for they annulled the sacrifice of the lord. 

18.  Samuel Officiates before The LORD And Samuel was officiating in the presence of the lord, a boy being girded [2ephod 1with a linen].

19. And [5double garment 4a small 3made 1his  2mother] for him, and offered it to him from days unto days in  her ascending with  her husband, to sacrifice the sacrifice of the days.

20. And Eli blessed  Elkanah and  his wife, saying, [2pay 3to you 1the lord] seed from out of  this woman, for the loan which she treated the lord. And [3went forth 1the 2man] to  his place.

21. And the lord visited  Hannah, and she conceived again, and she bore yet three sons and two daughters. And [4was magnified 1the 2boy 3Samuel] in the presence of the lord.

22. And Eli was an old man, exceedingly. And he heard what [2did  1his sons] to [2the 3sons 4of Israel 1all], and that [2went to bed  1his sons] with the women  standing by the doors of the tent of the testimony.

23. And he said to them, Why do you do according to  these things, which I hear being spoken ill of you from the mouth of all the people of the lord?

24. No children, no, for it is not good, the hearing which I hear of the making the people to not serve to the lord.

25. If by sinning [2should sin 1a man] against a man, then they shall pray for him to the lord. But if [3against the 4 lord 2sins 1a man], who shall pray for him? But they did not hearken to the voice  of their father. For willing, the lord preferred to utterly destroy them.

26. And the boy Samuel went on and was magnified, and was in good standing with the lord, and with men.

27. And [4came 1the 2man 3of God] to Eli, and said to him, Thus says the lord, In revealing I revealed myself to the house  of your father in their being [5in 6the land 7of Egypt 1servants 2to the 3house 4of Pharaoh].

28. And I chose the house  of your father from out of all the tribes of Israel to officiate as priest to me,  to ascend unto my altar, and to burn incense, and to carry an ephod before me. And I gave to the house  of your father all the things [3of the 4fire 1of the 2sacrifices] of the sons of Israel for food.

29. Why have you looked upon  my incense offering, and upon  my sacrifice offering with an impudent eye, and glorified  your sons above me, in them blessing themselves with the first-fruit of every sacrifice of Israel, prior of me?

30. On account of this, thus says the lord, the God of Israel, I said,  Your house, and the house  of your father shall go through before me unto the eon. And now, says the lord, not even one will be to me, for the ones glorifying me I will glorify, and the ones treating me with contempt shall be disgraced.

31. Behold, [2come 1days], and I shall utterly destroy  your seed, and the seed of the house of your father.

32. And you shall look upon [2fortifications 1new] upon all the things which [2shall do good  1Israel]. And there will not be an old man in  your house all the days.

33. And a man whom I should not utterly destroy among you from  my altar, I will make [2to fail  1his eyes], and [2will flow down  1his life], and all the ones abounding  of your house shall fall by the broadsword of men.

34. And this is to you the sign which shall come upon  [2two 3sons 1these your], on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day [2shall die 1both].

35. And I will raise up for myself [2priest 1a trustworthy] who [2all 3the things 4in  5my heart 6and 7the things 8in  9my soul 1will do]. And I will build to him [2house 1a trustworthy], and he shall go through before my anointed one all the days.

36. And it will be everyone  being left behind among  your house shall come to do obeisance to him for an obolus of silver, and for [2bread loaf 1one], saying, Throw me aside upon one  of your priesthoods  to eat bread!  

## 1 Samuel 3

1.  God Speaks to Samuel And the boy Samuel was officiating to the lord before Eli the priest. And the word of the lord was esteemed in  those days, because there was no vision for giving orders.

2. And it came to pass in  that day that Eli slept in  his own place, and  his eyes began to be darkened, and he was not able to see.

3. And the lamp  of God was before its being extinguished, and Samuel slept in the temple of the lord where the ark  of God was.

4. And the lord called, Samuel Samuel. And he said, Behold, it is I.

5. And he ran to Eli, and said, Behold, it is I, for you called me. And he said, I have not called you, return and sleep! And he returned and slept.

6. And [2added 1the lord] again to call Samuel. And he went to Eli the second time, and said, Behold, it is I, for you called me. And he said, I have not called you child, return and sleep!

7. And it was before Samuel  knew  God, and before the revealing the word of the lord to him.

8. And the lord added again to call Samuel a third time. And he rose up and went to Eli. And said, Behold, it is I, for you have called me. And Eli discerned that the lord has called the boy.

9. And Eli said to Samuel, Return and sleep child! And it will be if he should call you, that you shall say, Speak, O lord, for [2hears  1your servant]! And Samuel went, and went to bed in  his place.

10. And the lord came, and stood, and called him as once before, and once before that, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said, Speak, O lord, for [2hears  1your servant]!

11. And the lord said to Samuel, Behold, I perform  my words in Israel, so that every one hearing them, it shall sound in both  of his ears.

12. In  that day I rouse up against Eli. All as many things as I spoke against  his house I will begin and I will complete.

13. And I have announced to him that I punish, I,  his house, unto the eon for the iniquities of his sons, in which he knew that [2were speaking evil of 3God  1his sons], and he did not admonish them.

14. And [2not 3thus 1have I] sworn by an oath to the house of Eli, Shall [5be atoned 1the 2iniquity 3of the house 4of Eli] by incense or by sacrifices into the eon, no.

15. And Samuel went to bed until morning. And he rose up early in the morning, and he opened the doors of the house of the lord. And Samuel feared to report the vision  to Eli.

16. And Eli said to Samuel, Samuel child. And he said, Behold, it is I.

17. And he said, What was the word  being spoken to you? Do not indeed hide them from me! Thus [2do 3to you  1God], and thus add to it if you should hide from me the word.

18. And Samuel reported to him all the words, and did not hide them from him. And Eli said, The lord himself [2the 3good thing 4before 5him 1will do].

19. And Samuel was magnified, and the lord was with him. And there did not fall from all  his words one upon the ground.

20. And [3knew 1all 2Israel] from Dan and unto Beer-sheba that Samuel was trustworthy for prophet to the lord.

21. And the lord added again  to manifest in Shiloh, for the lord was revealed to Samuel in Shiloh according to the word of the lord.  

## 1 Samuel 4

1.  The Philistines Wage War with Israel And came to pass the word of Samuel to all Israel. And [3gathered together 1the 2Philistines] for war against Israel; and Israel went forth to meet them for war. And they camped at Ebenezer. And the Philistines camped in Aphek.

2. And [3deployed 1the 2Philistines] for war against Israel. And [3leaned one way 1the 2war], and [3failed 1the men 2of Israel] before the Philistines. And there was struck in the battle array in the field four thousand men.

3. And [3came 1the 2people] into the camp. And [4said 1the 2elders 3of Israel], Why is it so [2devestated 3us 1the lord] today before the Philistines? We should take to us the ark of the covenant of the lord from out of Shiloh, and let it come forth in our midst! and it will deliver us from the hand  of our enemies.

4. And [3sent 1the 2people] unto Shiloh, and they lifted from there the ark of covenant of the lord of the forces, which sits upon the cherubim. And both the sons of Eli were with the ark of the covenant  of God -- Hophni and Phinehas.

5. And it came to pass as [6came 1the 2ark 3of the 4covenant 5of the lord] into the camp, that [3shouted aloud 1all 2Israel 5voice 4with a great], and [3resounded 1the 2earth].

6. And [3heard 1the 2Philistines] the sound of the cry. And they said, What is the sound of the cry --  this great one in the camp of the Hebrews? And they knew that the ark of the lord comes into the camp.

7. And [3feared 1the 2Philistines], and said, This  their God comes to them into the camp.

8. Woe to us, rescue us, O Master, today! for it happened not thus yesterday nor the third day before. Woe to us, who shall rescue us from out of the hand  [3gods  2substantial 1of these]? These are the gods  striking  Egypt in every calamity, and in the wilderness.

9. Fortify, and become as men, O Philistines! so that you should not serve to the Hebrews, as they served us; and you shall be  men and wage war against them.

10. And [3waged war against 1the 2Philistines] them; and [3failed 1every man 2of Israel] before the Philistines, and [2fled 1each] unto  his tent. And there came to pass [3calamity 2great 1an exceedingly]; and there fell from Israel thirty thousand from the ranks. 

11.  The Ark Taken: Eli's Sons Die And the ark  of God was taken, and both the sons of Eli died -- Hophni and Phinehas.

12. And there ran a man of Benjamin from out of the battle array, and he came into Shiloh on  that day; and  his garments were torn up, and earth was upon  his head.

13. And he came. And behold, Eli sat upon  his chair by the gate watching the way, for [2was 1his heart] receded on account of the ark  of God. And the man entered into the city to report. And [4yelled out 2whole 1the 3city].

14. And Eli heard the sound of the yelling, and said, What is  [2sound  3of yelling 1this]? And the man hastening, entered and reported  to Eli.

15. And Eli was a son ninety and eight years old, and  his eyes were weighed down, and he did not see.

16. And Eli said to the men, to the ones standing around him, What is the report  of this sound? And the man hastening, came forward to Eli, and he said to him, I am the one having come from the camp, and I have fled from the battle array today. And Eli said, What is the [2taking place 1thing] child?

17. And [3answered 1the 2servant-lad], and said, [3fled 1Every man 2of Israel] from the face of the Philistines, and [2calamity 1a great] has happened among the people, and both  of your sons have died, and the ark  of God was taken.

18. And it happened as [4was mentioned 1the 2ark  3of God], that he fell from the chair backwardly, being next to the gate, and [3was broken  2back 1his], and he died, for [3was old 1the 2man] and heavy; and he judged  Israel forty years.

19. And  his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, having conceived  to give birth, when she heard the message that [4was taken 1the 2ark  3of God], and that [2has died  1her father-in-law], and  her husband; that she wept and gave birth, for [3turned 4upon 5her 2birth pangs 1her].

20. And in the time she was going to die, that [5said 6to her 1the 2women  3standing beside 4her], Do not fear! for [2a son 1you have birthed]. But she did not answer, and did not comprehend  in her heart.

21. And she called the boy, Ichabod, for the ark  of God, and for  her father-in-law, and for  her husband.

22. And she said, [2has been resettled 1The glory] from Israel, for [4was taken 1the 2ark  3of God].  

## 1 Samuel 5

1.  The Ark in the House of Dagon And the Philistines took the ark  of God, and carried it from out of Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

2. And [3took 1the 2Philistines] the ark, of God and carried it into the house of Dagon, and stood it by Dagon.

3. And [3rose early 1the 2Ashdodites], and they entered into the house of Dagon the next day. And they saw, and behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face upon the ground before the ark  of God. And they raised  Dagon, and they placed him upon  his place.

4. And it came to pass as they rose early in the next day in the morning, and behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face before of the ark of the lord. And the head of Dagon, and both the traces of his hands were removed unto the front of the doorposts, and both the wrists  of his hands were fallen upon the threshold. Only the spine of Dagon was left behind.

5. On account of this, [4do not 5mount 1the 2priests 3of Dagon], nor do any  enter into the house of Dagon by the threshold of the house of Dagon in Ashdod until  this day; but by passing over, they pass over it.

6. And [4was oppressive 1the 2hand 3of the lord] against the Ashdodites, and he tormented the Ashdodites, and he struck them in  their buttock -- the one from Ashdod and  their borders.

7. And [4beheld 1the 2men 3of Ashdod] that it was so, and they spoke saying that, [6shall not settle 1the 2ark 3of the 4God 5of Israel] with us, for [2is hard  1his hand] against us, and against Dagon  our god. 

8.  God Strikes the Philistines And they send and gather the satraps of the Philistines to themselves. And they say, What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And [3say 1the 2Gathites], Let [4pass between the ranks 1the 2ark  3of God] to us! And [6passed between the ranks 1the 2ark 3of the 4God 5of Israel] unto Gath.

9. And it came to pass after  it being passed through the ranks, that [3came 1the hand 2of the lord] against the city -- [3disturbance 2great 1an exceedingly]; and he struck the men of the city from small unto great in  their buttocks.

10. And they sent out the ark  of God unto Ekron. And it came to pass as [3entered 1the ark 2of God] unto Ekron, that [3yelled out 1the Ekronites], saying, Why do you return the ark of the God of Israel to us, is it to put us to death and  our people?

11. And they sent, and they brought together all the satraps of the Philistines. And they said, Send out the ark of the God of Israel, and let it sit in  its place, so that in no way shall we be put to death -- us and  our people.

12. For there came to pass a confusion of death in the entire  city, [2severe 1exceedingly], as [6entered 1the 2ark 3of the 4God 5of Israel]. And the living and the dying were struck in the buttocks. And [5ascended 1the 2cry 3of the 4city] unto the heaven.  

## 1 Samuel 6

1.  The Philistines Return the Ark to Israel And [4was 1the 2ark 3of the lord] in the field of the Philistines seven months.

2. And [2called 1the Philistines] the priests, and the clairvoyants, and  their enchanters, saying, What should we do with the ark of the lord? Make known to us by what means we shall send it unto  its place!

3. And they said, If you yourselves send the ark of the covenant of the lord God of Israel, do not send it out empty! but by delivering it up, you give it back for the torment! and then you shall be healed, and it shall be atoned unto you, if should you not remove  his hand from you?

4. And they say, What thing for the torment shall we give for it? And they said,

5. According to the number of the satrapies of the Philistines -- five buttocks of gold, for the fault in you, and  your rulers, and to the people. And five [2mice 1golden], a representation  of your mice, of the ones corrupting the land. And you shall give to the lord God glory, so that he should lighten  his hand from you, and from  your gods, and from  your land.

6. And why do you oppress  your hearts as [4oppressed 1Egypt 2and 3Pharaoh]  their hearts? Was it not when he mocked them, that they sent them, and they went forth?

7. And now, take and make [3wagon 2new 1one], and two oxen having given birth for the first time, without the offspring, upon which [2was not placed upon 1a yoke]! And team up the oxen on the wagon, and  their offspring lead away from behind them to the house!

8. And you shall take the ark of the lord, and you shall put it upon the wagon; and the items  of gold, deliver it for the torment! And you shall put in place a chest on part of it, and you shall send it, and it shall go forth.

9. And you shall see if into the way of their border it shall go -- according to Beth-shemesh, if he did to us  [3evil  2great 1this]. And if not, then we will know that it was not his hand that touched us, but that [3a coincidence 1this 2was] to us.

10. And [3did 1the 2Philistines] so. And they took two oxen, having given birth for the first time. And they teamed them up to the wagon, and  their offspring they shut up at the house.

11. And they put the ark of the lord upon the wagon, and the place chest, and the mice  of gold, and the images  of their buttocks.

12. And [3straightened out 1the 2oxen] in the journey on the way to Beth-Shemesh, in a road in  its going, and they labored, and they turned not aside right nor left; and the satraps of the Philistines went after them unto the borders of Beth-shemesh.

13. And the ones in Beth-shemesh were harvesting the harvest of wheat in the valley. And they lifted  their eyes, and they beheld the ark of the lord, and they were rejoiced to meet it.

14. And the wagon entered into the field of Joshua, the one in Beth-shemesh, and it stood there by [2stone 1a great]. And they split the wood of the wagon, and the oxen they offered for a whole burnt-offering to the lord.

15. And the Levites brought the ark of the lord, and the place chest with it, and the items  of gold, and put them upon the [2stone  1great]. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered whole burnt-offerings, and they sacrificed sacrifices to the lord in  that day.

16. And the five satraps of the Philistines saw, and they returned to Ekron  in that day.

17. And these are the [2buttocks  1gold] which [3gave back 1the 2Philistines] for the torment to the lord --  for Ashdod one,  Gaza one,  Ashkelon one,  Gath one,  Ekron one.

18. And [2mice  1gold], according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, of the five satraps, from the city being solidly fortified, and unto the town of the Perezzite, and unto [3stone 1the 2great] of which they placed upon it the ark of the covenant of the lord until  this day in the field of Joshua, of the one of Beth-shemesh. 

19.  God Strikes the Men of Beth-shemesh And he struck the men of Beth-shemesh, for they beheld the ark of the lord. And he struck among them seventy men, and fifty thousand men of the people. And [3mourned 1the 2people] because the lord struck among the people [3calamity 2great 1an exceedingly].

20. And they said, the men, the ones from Beth-shemesh, Who shall be able to stand before the lord,  [3God  2holy 1this]? And to whom shall [5ascend 1the 2ark 3of the 4 lord] of us?

21. And they sent messengers to the ones dwelling in Kirjath-jearim, saying, [3returned 1The 2Philistines] the ark of the lord, and you go down and lead it up unto you!  

## 1 Samuel 7

1.  The Ark Brought into the House of Abinadab And [4came 1the 2men 3of Kirjath-jearim], and they led up the ark of the covenant of the lord. And they brought it into the house of Abinadab  on the hill. And  [2Eleazar  3his son 1they sanctified] to guard the ark of the covenant of the lord.

2. And it came to pass from which day [3was 1the 2ark] in Kirjath-jearim, [3were multiplied 1the 2days]. And they became twenty years; and [4looked 1all  2the house 3of Israel] after the lord.

3. And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, saying, If with [2entire 3heart 1your] you turn to the lord, remove the gods of the aliens from your midst, and the sacred groves, and prepare  your hearts to the lord, and serve him alone! and he will rescue you from out of the hand of the Philistines.

4. And [4removed 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the Baalim, and the sacred groves of Ashtaroth, and served to the lord alone. 

5.  Samuel Judges Israel in Mizpeh And Samuel said, Gather all Israel unto Mizpeh! and I will pray to the lord for you.

6. And [3gathered together 1the 2people] in Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the lord upon the ground. And they fasted in  that day, and said, We have sinned against the lord. And Samuel adjudicated for the sons of Israel in Mizpeh.

7. And [3heard 1the 2Philistines] that [5were gathered together 1all 2the 3sons 4of Israel] in Mizpeh. And [5ascended 1the 2satraps 3of the 4Philistines] against Israel. and [4heard 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they were fearful from the face of the Philistines.

8. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to Samuel, Do not remain silent from us!  to not yell to the lord  your God, that he shall deliver us from out of the hand of the Philistines.

9. And Samuel took [3lamb 2suckling 1one], and he offered it a whole burnt-offering to the lord with all the people. And Samuel yelled to the lord over  Israel, and [3heeded 4him 1the 2 lord]. 

10.  Israel Strikes the Philistines And Samuel was offering the whole burnt-offering. And the Philistines led forward for war against Israel. And the lord thundered with [2voice 1a great] in  that day against the Philistines, and they were confounded, and failed before Israel.

11. And [3came forth 1the men 2of Israel] from out of Mizpeh, and they pursued the Philistines, and they struck them unto under  Beth-car.

12. And Samuel took [2stone 1one], and set it between Mizpeh and between the old city. And he called the name of it, Ebenezer,  signifying, Stone of the Helper. And he said, Unto here [3helped 4us 1the 2 lord].

13. And the lord humbled the Philistines, and they did not proceed any longer  to come unto the border of Israel. And [3was 1the hand 2of the lord] against the Philistines all the days  of Samuel.

14. And [3were given back 1the 2cities] which [3took 1the 2Philistines] from the sons of Israel -- from Ekron unto Gath. And the border of Israel was removed from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and between the Amorite.

15. And Samuel adjudicated for  Israel all the days  of his life.

16. And he went according to year by year and circled about Beth-el, and  Gilgal, and  Mizpeh. And he adjudicated for  Israel in all  these places.

17.  And his returning was unto Ramah; for [2was there  1his house]; and he adjudicated for Israel there, and he built there an altar to the lord.  

## 1 Samuel 8

1.  Samuel's Wicked Sons And it came to pass as Samuel grew old, that he placed  his sons as magistrates  in Israel.

2. And these are the names  of his sons. The first-born was Joel, and the name of the second Abiah, magistrates in Beer-sheba.

3. And [2did not 3go  1his sons] in his way. And they turned aside after the contribution, and they took bribes, and turned aside ordinances. 

4.  Israel Asks for a King And [3gathered together 1the men 2of Israel], and they came to Samuel into Ramah.

5. And they said to him, Behold, you grow old, and  your sons do not go in  your way. And now place over us a king to adjudicate for us as all the nations!

6. And [3was 4wicked 1the 2matter] in the eyes of Samuel, as they said, Give to us a king  to adjudicate for us! And Samuel prayed to the lord.

7. And the lord said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people! as whatever they should speak to you, for it is not you they treat with contempt, but only me they treat with contempt,  to not reign over them.

8. According to all the works which they did to me, from which day I led them from Egypt, and until  this day; even as they abandoned me, and served other gods, so they do also to you.

9. And now hearken to their voice! Only that in testifying you should testify to them, and you shall report to them the ordinance of the king, which shall reign over them.

10. And Samuel spoke all the words of the lord to the people, of the ones asking of him for a king. 

11.  Ordinance Regarding Kings And he said, This will be the ordinance of the king, of the one reigning over you.  Your sons he shall take and put them in his chariots and among his horsemen, and they shall run in front  of his chariots.

12. And he will appoint them for himself as commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds,  to plow  his plowing, and to harvest his harvest, and to gather the vintage of his gathering the crops, and to make items for his warfare, and items for his chariots.

13. And  your daughters he will take for perfumers, and for cooks, and for baking.

14. And  your fields, and  your vineyards, and  [3olive groves 1your  2good] he will take and will give to his servants.

15. And  your seeds he will take a tenth, and  of your vineyards, and he will give to his eunuchs, and to his servants.

16. And  your menservants, and  your maidservants, and  [3herds 1your  2good], and  your donkeys he shall take; and he will take a tenth for  his works.

17. And  [2of your flocks 1he will take a tenth]. And you will be to him for servants.

18. And you shall yell in  that day before the face  of your king, of which you chose for yourselves; and [2will not heed 1the lord] you in  those days.

19. And [3willed not 1the 2people] to hearken to the voice  of Samuel. And they said to him, Not so, but let it be that a king will be over us.

20. And [3will be 2also 1we] as all the nations. And [3shall adjudicate 4for us 2king 1our], and he shall go forth in front of us, and he will wage  our war.

21. And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them into the ears of the lord.

22. And the lord said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and let [2reign 3unto them 1a king]! And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let [2run 1each man] to  his city!  

## 1 Samuel 9

1.  The LORD Sends Saul to Samuel And there was a man from the sons of Benjamin, and his name was Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorath, son of Aphiah, son of a man of Benjamin, [2man 1a mighty] in strength.

2. And to this one was a son, and his name was Saul, a huge [2man 1goodly], and there was not among the sons of Israel one good above him. He was head and shoulders and [2above 1high] over all the land.

3. And [6were lost 1the 2donkeys 3of Kish 4the 5father 6of Saul]. And Kish said to Saul  his son, Take with yourself one of the servant-lads, and rise up and go and seek the donkeys!

4. And they went through mount Ephraim. And they went through the land of Shalitha, and they did not find. And they went through the land of Shalim, and it was not. And they went through the land of Benjamin, and they did not find.

5. And of their coming unto  Zuph, and Saul said to his servant-lad  with him, Come, for we should return, lest [2sparing  1my father] concerning the donkeys, should be thoughtful  concerning us.

6. And [3said 4to him 1the 2servant-lad], Behold, indeed a man of God is in  this city, and the man is honorable, all what ever he should speak, coming shall be at hand. And now, we should go there, so that he should report to us  our way, upon which we should go upon it.

7. And Saul said to his servant-lad  with him, Yes, behold, we shall go. But what shall we carry in to the man  of God, for the bread loaves have failed from out of  our containers, and [2much 1there is not] with us  to carry to the man  of God that exists to us?

8. And [3proceeded 1the 2servant-lad] to answer  Saul, and said, Behold, there is found in  my hand a fourth shekel of silver; and you shall give it to the man  of God, and he shall report to us  our way.

9. And before in Israel, thus said each man in their going to ask  God, Come, and we should go to the seer. For the prophet was called by the people before, The Seer.

10. And Saul said to  his servant-lad, [2is good  1your word]. Come, for we should go. And they went into the city of which was there the man, the one of God.

11. In their ascending the ascent of the city, and they found young women going forth to draw water. And they say to them, Is there here the seer?

12. And [3answered 1the 2young women] them, and they said, He is, behold, in front of you. Hasten! For now he comes into the city, because of the day, for a sacrifice today for the people in Bama.

13. As soon as you enter into the city, thus you shall find him in the city, before his ascending unto Bama  to eat; for in no way should [3eat 1the 2people] until  his entering. For this one blesses the sacrifice. And after these things [3eat 1the 2strangers]. And now, ascend! for on account of the day you shall find him.

14. And they ascend into the city. And they were entering in the midst of the city, and behold, Samuel came forth for the meeting them,  to ascend unto Bama.

15. And the lord uncovered the ear of Samuel [2day 1one] before  [2came 3to 4him 1Saul], saying,

16. At  this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him for ruler over  my people Israel, and he shall deliver  my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I looked upon the humiliation  of my people, for [2came  1their yelling] to me.

17. And Samuel beheld  Saul, and the lord answered him, Behold, the man whom I said to you, This one shall rule over  my people.

18. And Saul came to Samuel in the midst of the city, and he said, Report indeed to me, of what  house is the seer?

19. And Samuel answered  Saul, and said, I am he. Ascend before me unto Bama, and eat with me today! and I will send you in the morning, and all the things in  your heart I will report to you.

20. And concerning the donkeys  being lost to you today for three days, you should not put  your heart to them, for they are found. And what are the beautiful things  of Israel? Is it not to you, and to all the house  of your father?

21. And Saul answered and said, [2not 3a man 4a son 5of a Benjamite 1Am I], of the lesser chiefdom of the tribes of Israel? And  my family least of all the families  of Benjamin? And why have you spoken to me concerning  this thing?

22. And Samuel took  Saul and  his servant-lad, and he brought them into the lodging, and set for them a place among the foremost of the ones being called -- about thirty men.

23. And Samuel said to the cook, Give to me the portion which I gave to you, which I told you to put it by you.

24. And [3took 1the 2cook] the hind quarter, and the part upon it, and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said  to Saul, Behold, the leftover; place it before you, and eat! For as a testimony it is placed for you over the people -- pull it off! And Saul ate with Samuel in  that day.

25. And he went down from  Bama into the city. And they spread carpets  for Saul upon the roof, and he went to bed.

26. And it came to pass as [3ascended 1the 2dawn], that Samuel called to Saul upon the roof, saying, Rise up! and I shall send you out. And Saul rose up, and [4went forth 1he 2and 3Samuel] unto outside.

27. And as they were going down into the uttermost part of the city, that Samuel said  to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him go through in front of us! And you stand here today, and hear the word of God!  

## 1 Samuel 10

1.  Samuel Anoints Saul as King And Samuel took the flask,  of oil and poured down upon  his head, and kissed him. And he said to him, Is it not that [2anointed 3you 1the lord] as ruler over  his inheritance?

2. As soon as you should go forth today from me, that you shall find two men near the burying-places of Rachel, on the borders of Benjamin, leaping greatly. And they shall say to you, [3have been found 1the 2donkeys] which you went to seek. And behold,  your father brushed off the matter of the donkeys, and is worried about you, saying, What should I do about  my son?

3. And you shall go forth from there, and beyond. And you shall come unto the oak of Tabor, and you shall find there three men ascending to  God unto Beth-el, one taking three kids, and one taking three containers of bread loaves, and one taking a leather bag of wine.

4. And they shall ask you the things for peace; and they shall give to you two first-fruits of bread loaves, and you shall take them from out of  their hand.

5. And after these things you shall enter unto the hill  of God, of which is there the height of the Philistines. And it will take place when ever you should enter there into the city, that you will meet a company of dancers of prophets coming down from out of  Bama, and in front of them a stringed instrument, and tambourine, and pipe, and lute; and they are prophesying.

6. And [3shall spring 4upon 5you 1spirit 2of the lord], and you shall prophesy with them, and you shall turn into [2man 1another].

7. And it will be whenever [2shall come  1these signs] upon you, do all as much as [2should find  1your hand], for God is with you!

8. And you shall go down in front of me unto Gilgal. And behold, I come down to you,  to offer a whole burnt-offering, and to sacrifice sacrifice offerings of peace. Seven days you shall stop until  my coming to you, and to make known to you what you shall do.

9. And it came to pass so as [2turned  1his shoulder] to go forth from Samuel, that [2converted 3his  1God] heart to another. And came to pass all  these signs in  that day.

10. And he comes from there unto the hill. And behold, a company of dancers of prophets right opposite him; and [3leaped 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of God], and he prophesied in the midst of them.

11. And came to pass all the things being made known to him yesterday and the third day before. And behold, he was in the midst of the prophets prophesying. And [4said 1the 2people 3each] to  his neighbor, What is this, the thing having happened to the son of Kish? Or is also Saul among the prophets?

12. And [4answered 1a certain one 2of 3them], and said, And who is his father? On account of this it became for a parable, Might also Saul be among the prophets?

13. And he completed prophesying, and comes to the hill.

14. And [2said 3to him  1his uncle] and to his servant-lad, Where have you gone? And he said, To seek the donkeys, and we saw that they are not around, and we entered unto Samuel.

15. And [3said 1the 2uncle] to Saul, Report indeed to me what [2said 3to you 1Samuel]!

16. And Saul said to the member of his family, By reporting he reported to me that [3were found 1the 2donkeys]. But the matter of the kingdom, he did not report to him, what Samuel said.

17. And Samuel summoned all the people to the lord in Mizpeh.

18. And he said to the sons of Israel, Thus said the lord  God of Israel, saying, I led  Israel from out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and from the hand of all the kingdoms of the ones afflicting you.

19. And you today treat with contempt  your God, who he himself is your deliverer from out of all  your bad things, and  your afflictions. And you said, But only a king you shall place over us. And now, stand before the lord according to your tribes and according to your thousands!

20. And Samuel led forward all the tribes of Israel, and [3was chosen by lot 1the tribe 2of Benjamin]. 

21.  Saul Confirmed as King And he led forward the tribe of Benjamin according to family, and [3was chosen by lot 1the family 2of Matri]. And [4was chosen by lot 1Saul 2son 3of Kish]. And he sought him, and he was not found.

22. And Samuel asked again to the lord, Shall [4come 3still 5here 1the 2man]? And the lord said, Behold, he hides among the equipment.

23. And he ran and took him from there, and placed him in the midst of the people, and he was high above all the people -- head and shoulders and above.

24. And Samuel said to all the people, You see whom [3has chosen 4for himself 1the 2 lord], that there is not one likened to him among all you? And [4knew 1all 2the 3people], and said, Let [3live 1the 2king]!

25. And Samuel spoke to the people the ordinance of the kingship. And he wrote in a scroll, and put it before the lord. And Samuel sent out all the people, and [2went forth 1each] unto  his place.

26. And Saul went forth unto  his house in Gibeah. And [4went 1the 2sons 3of power] (whom the lord touched their hearts) with Saul.

27. And  [2sons 1the mischievous] said, Who is [2that shall deliver 3us 1this]? And they dishonored him, and did not bring him gifts. And he became one being silent.  

## 1 Samuel 11

1.  War with the Ammonites And [4ascended 1Nahash 2the 3Ammonite], and camped against Jabish Gilead. And [5said 1all 2the 3men 4of Jabish] to Nahash the Ammonite, Ordain with us a covenant! and we will serve you.

2. And [4said 5to 6them 1Nahash 2the 3Ammonite], By this I will ordain with you a covenant, in the gouging out of all of you [2eye 1the right], and I will make it for scorn upon all Israel.

3. And [4spoke 5to him 1the 2men 3of Jabish], saying, Spare us seven days, and we will send messengers unto every border of Israel. And if there might not be  one delivering us, then we will come forth to you.

4. And [3came 1the 2messengers] into Gibeah to Saul, and they spoke  these words into the ears of the people; and [4lifted up 1all 2the 3people]  their voice, and they wept.

5. And behold, Saul came from behind the oxen from out of the field. And Saul said, Why is it that [3weep 1the 2people]? And they described to him the words of the men of Jabish.

6. And [3sprang up 1spirit 2of the lord] upon Saul, as he heard  these words, and [3enraged 4over 5them 1his anger 2was exceedingly].

7. And he took two oxen, and dismembered them, and sent them unto every border of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever is not going forth after Saul and after Samuel, according to thus they shall do to his oxen. And there fell a change of state of the lord upon the people, and they yelled as [2man 1one].

8. And he numbered them in Bezek, all the men of Israel -- three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah -- thirty thousand.

9. And he said to the messengers, to the ones coming, Thus you shall say to the men of Jabish Gilead, Tomorrow there will be deliverance to you at the warming through of the sun. And [3came 1the 2messengers] into the city, and they reported to the men of Jabish, and they were glad.

10. And [4said 1the 2men 3of Jabish] to Nahash the Ammonite, Tomorrow we shall come forth to you, and you shall do to us what is good before you.

11. And it came to pass with the morning, that Saul put the people into three companies, and they entered into the midst of the camp in the early morning watch, and they struck the sons of Ammon until [3warmed through 1the 2day]. And it came to pass, the ones being left behind were scattered, and there was not left behind among them two together.

12. And [3said 1the 2people] to Samuel, Who is the one saying, Saul shall not reign over us? Deliver up the men! and we will kill them.

13. And Saul said, Not shall [2die 1any one] in  this day, for today the lord produced deliverance in Israel.

14. And Samuel said to the people, saying, Come, we should go unto Gilgal, and we should renew there the kingdom.

15. And [4went 1all 2the 3people] unto Gilgal; and Samuel anointed Saul there as king before the lord in Gilgal. And he sacrificed there sacrifice offerings and peace offerings before the lord. And [2was glad 3there 1Saul] and all the men of Israel greatly.  

## 1 Samuel 12

1.  Samuel's Discourse And Samuel said to every man of Israel, Behold, I hearkened to  your voice in all as many things as you said to me, and I gave reign over you a king.

2. And now, behold, the king travels before you. And I grow old and shall sit. And behold,  my sons are among you. And I, behold, I have gone before you from my youth, and until  this day.

3. Behold, I am here. You should respond against me before the lord, and before  his anointed one. Whose calf have I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or who of you have I tyrannized over? or who have I pressured? or from out of whose hand have I taken an appeasement, or a sandal? Should you respond to me, then I will give it back to you.

4. And they said to Samuel, You did not wrong us, and you did not tyrannize over us, and you have not taken from [2hand 1anyone's] -- not one thing.

5. And Samuel said to the people, The lord is witness among you, and [2is witness  1his anointed one] in this  day, that you have not found in  my hand anything. And they said, He is witness.

6. And Samuel said to the people, saying, The lord is witness, the one preparing  Moses and  Aaron, and the one leading  our fathers out of Egypt.

7. And now stand, and I will adjudicate for you before the lord, and I will report to you all the righteousness of the lord, which he did to you, and to your fathers,

8. as [4entered 1Jacob 2and  3his sons] into Egypt, and [2humbled 3them 1Egypt]. And [2yelled  1our fathers] to the lord, and the lord sent  Moses and  Aaron. And he led  our fathers out of Egypt, and settled them in  this place.

9. And they forgot the lord  their God, and he gave them into the hands of Sisera commander-in-chief of Jabish, king of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the king of Moab; and they waged war with them.

10. And they yelled to the lord, and said, We sinned, for we abandoned the lord, and we served to the Baalim, and to the sacred groves. And now rescue us from the hand of our enemies! and we will serve you.

11. And the lord sent  Jerubbaal, and  Barak, and  Jephthah, and  Samuel, and rescued you round about from the hand  of your enemies, and you dwell secure. 

12.  Samuel's Warning And you beheld that Nahash king of the sons of Ammon came upon you, and you said, No, but only that a king shall reign over us. And the lord  our God is your king.

13. And now behold, the king whom you chose and whom you acquire. And behold, the lord puts over you a king!

14. If you should fear the lord, and should serve to him, and should hearken to  his voice, and should not contend with the mouth of the lord, then you should be (even you yourselves, and the king  reigning over you) going after the lord your God.

15. But if you should not hearken to the voice of the lord, and should contend with the mouth of the lord, then [3will be 1the hand 2of the lord] against you, and against  your king.

16. And now, stand and behold  [2thing  1this great] which the lord will do in your eyes!

17. Is it not the harvest of wheat today? I shall call upon the lord, and he will give thundering sounds and rain. And know and behold! that great is your evil which you did before the lord, asking for yourselves a king.

18. And Samuel called upon the lord; and the lord gave sounds and rain in  that day. And [4feared 1all 2the 3people] the lord exceedingly, and  Samuel.

19. And [4said 1all 2the 3people] to Samuel, Pray for  your servants to the lord  your God! and in no way we should die, for we added unto all  our sins this evil asking for ourselves a king.

20. And Samuel said to the people, Do not fear! You have done all  this evil, except you should not turn aside from following after the lord. And serve to the lord with [2entire  3heart 1your]!

21. And you should not turn aside after the things being nothing, which achieve nothing, and which shall not rescue, for they are nothing.

22. For [2shall not 3thrust away 1the lord]  his people because of  [3name 1his  2great]; for [2took 1the lord] you to make for a people to himself.

23. But to me, may it not be to sin against the lord, to stop praying for you to the lord. But I will manifest to you the [4way  1good 2and  3straight].

24. Only fear the lord, and serve him in truth, and with [2entire 3heart 1your]! For see what he magnified with you!

25. And if by evil you should do evil, then you and  your king shall be added to your dead.  

## 1 Samuel 13

1.  The Philistines Wage War with Israel [2was a son 3a year 1Saul] in  his taking reign, and two years he reigned in Israel.

2. And [2chose 3for himself 1Saul] three thousand men from the men of Israel. And there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash, and in the mountain of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah  of Benjamin. And the rest of the people he sent out, each man unto  his tent.

3. And Jonathan struck the Nasib of the Philistines, the one in the hill. And [3heard 1the 2Philistines], and Saul trumped the trumpet in all the land, saying, [3disregard us 1The 2servants].

4. And all Israel heard, saying, Saul has smitten the Nasib of the Philistines; and Israel was put to shame by the Philistines. And [3ascended up 1the 2people] after Saul in Gilgal.

5. And the Philistines gather together for war against  Israel. And they ascend upon  Israel for war -- thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand  by the edge of the sea in the multitude. And they ascend and camp in Michmash opposite according to the south of Beth-aven.

6. And the man of Israel beheld that they were in a strait [2to not lead forward 1for them]; and [3hid 1the 2people] in the caves, and in the lairs, and in the rocks, and in the excavations, and in the pits.

7. And the ones passing over, passed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul still was in Gilgal, and all the people were receded after him.

8. And he stopped seven days, according to the testimony as Samuel said. And [2did not 3come 1Samuel] unto Gilgal, and [2scattered  1his people] from him. 

9.  Saul Sacrifices in Folly And Saul said, Lead forward animals so that I should offer a whole burnt-offering, and peace offerings; and he offered the whole burnt-offering.

10. And it came to pass as he completed offering the whole burnt-offering, that behold, Samuel arrived. And Saul came forth to meet him, to bless him.

11. And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that [3scattered 1the 2people] from me, and you did not come in the testimony of the days as you set in order, and the Philistines were gathered together in Michmash,

12. and I said, Now [3shall come down 1the 2Philistines] to me in Gilgal, and the face of the lord I beseeched not; and I took control myself and offered the whole burnt-offering.

13. And Samuel said to Saul, It is folly to you that you kept not  my commandment which [2gave charge 3to you 1the lord]. As the lord prepared  your kingdom over Israel unto the eon.

14. And now  your kingdom shall not stand with you. And the lord shall seek for himself a man according to  his heart. And the lord shall give charge to him for ruler over  his people, for you did not keep as many things as [3gave charge 4to you 1the 2 lord].

15. And Samuel rose up and went forth from out of Gilgal unto the hill of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people  being found with him, about six hundred men.

16. And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people  being found with him, stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the Philistines camped in Michmash.

17. And men came forth to destroy out of the field of the Philistines in three companies. The [2company  1one] looking upon the way of Ophrah, towards the land of Shual.

18. And [2company  1one] looking upon the way of Beth-horon. And  [2company  1one] looking upon the way of Gibeah, the one looking towards Gai, the Zeboim  wilderness.

19. And a fabricator of iron was not found in all the land of Israel, for [3said 1the 2Philistines], Perhaps [3will make 1the 2Hebrews] a broadsword and spear.

20. And [3went down 1all 2Israel] into the land of the Philistines, [2to forge 1for each]  his own reaping hook, and  his utensil, and each  his axe, and  his sickle.

21. And [3was 1the 2gathering of crops] prepared  to harvest. But for the items there was a charge of three shekels for the tooth, and to the axe, and to the sickle; the support camp was the same.

22. And it came to pass in the days of the war, that there was not found broadsword and spear in the hand of all the people, of the one with Saul and Jonathan. But it was found with Saul and  Jonathan his son.

23. And [4went forth 5from 1the support camp 2of the 3Philistines] the place on the other side of Michmash.  

## 1 Samuel 14

1.  Jonathan Pursues the Philistines And came to pass a day, that [4said 1Jonathan 2the son 3of Saul] to the servant-lad  carrying  his weapons, Come, for we should pass over unto the support camp of the Philistines, the one on  that other side; but [3to 4his father 1he did not 2report].

2. And Saul settled upon the hill under the pomegranate, the one in Migron. And the people, the one with him, was about six hundred men.

3. And Ahijah son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, son of Phinehas, son of Eli the priest of the lord in Shiloh was carrying the ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.

4. And in the midst of the ford of which Jonathan sought to pass over into the support camp of the Philistines was an extremity rock from here and an extremity rock from there; the name given to the one was Bozez, and the name given to the other was Seneh.

5. The [2extremity  1one] from the north was going to Michmash, and the [2extremity  1other] from the south was going to Gibeah.

6. And Jonathan said to the servant-lad  carrying  his weapons, Come, and we should pass over into the support camp  of these uncircumcised, if perchance the lord may commit to us; for [3is not 1the 2 lord] holding back to deliver by many or by few.

7. And [4said 5to him 1the one 2carrying  3his weapons], You do all what ever  your heart should will, turn yourself! Behold, I [2with 3you 1am]. As  your heart  my heart.

8. And Jonathan said, Behold, we pass over to the men, and we will roll down upon them.

9. If thus they should say to us, Abstain there until whenever we should approach to you. Then we shall stand by ourselves, and in no way shall we ascend unto them.

10. And If thus they should say to us, Ascend to us! then we will ascend, for [2has delivered 3them 1the lord] into our hands. This will be to us the sign.

11. And they entered both unto the support camp of the Philistines. And [3said 1the 2Philistines], Behold, [3come forth 1the 2Hebrews] from out of  their burrows where they hide there.

12. And [5responded 1the 2men 3of the 4support camp] to Jonathan and to the one carrying  his weapons, and they say, Ascend to us! and we will make known to you a thing. And Jonathan said to the one carrying  his weapons, You ascend after me! for [2has delivered 3them 1the lord] into the hands of Israel.

13. And Jonathan ascended upon  his hands and upon  his feet, and the one carrying  his weapons after him. And they looked upon the person of Jonathan, and he struck among them, and the one carrying  his weapons gave over after him.

14. And came to pass the [2beating  1first] which Jonathan struck and the one carrying  his weapons, was about twenty men by arrows, and by rock slinging, and by pebbles of the plain.

15. And came to pass a change of state in the camp, and in the field. And all the people, the one in the support camp, and the ones being utterly destroyed, [3were startled 1even 2they]. And [3was distraught 1the 2land], and there took place a change of state because of the lord.

16. And [4beheld 1the 2watchmen  3of Saul] in Gibeah of Benjamin. And behold, the camp was disturbed on this side and that side.

17. And Saul said to the people  with him, You number yourselves indeed, and see who has gone out from us! And they numbered. And behold, [2was not 3found 1Jonathan] and the one carrying  his weapons.

18. And Saul said  to Ahijah, Bring the ephod! for [4was 1the 2ark  3of God] in  that day before Israel

19. And it came to pass as Saul spoke to the priest, that the sound in the camp of the Philistines [2going louder 1went out], and it multiplied. And Saul said to the priest, Gather together  your hands! 

20.  God Rescues Israel from the Philistines And Saul ascended, and all the people  with him, and they came unto the battle. And behold, [3was 2broadsword 1every man's] upon  his neighbor, and [3confusion 2great 1an exceedingly].

21. And the servants  being yesterday and the third day before with the Philistines, the ones ascending into the camp, turned themselves also to be with Israel, of the ones with Saul and Jonathan.

22. And every man of Israel, the ones hiding in  mount Ephraim, heard that [3have fled 1the 2Philistines]. And they joined together also themselves after them to battle. And the lord delivered [2in  3that day  1Israel]. And the war went through  Beth-aven. And all the people being with Saul were about ten thousand men.

23. And [3was 1the 2war] dispersing into every  city in  mount Ephraim. 

24.  Saul's Foolish Oath And Saul knew not [2ignorance 1through great] in  that day, and he curses the people, saying, Accursed is the man who shall eat bread until evening -- so I will punish for  my enemy. And not [4tasted 1any 2of the 3people] bread, and all the land went unto Grove.

25. And at Grove was an apiary by the face of the field.

26. And [3entered 1the 2people] into the apiary, and behold, [2went forth 1honey]. And there was not the one turning  his hand to  his mouth, for [3feared 1the 2people] the oath of the lord.

27. And Jonathan did not hear in the binding [3by an oath 4by 5his father 1the 2people]. And he stretched out the tip  of his staff, of the one in  his hand, and he dipped it into the honeycomb of the honey, and he returned  his hand to  his mouth, and [2looked up  1his eyes].

28. And [5responded 1one 2of 3the 4people] and said, By an oath [2bound  1your father] the people, saying, Accursed be the man who shall eat bread today; and [3were faint 1the 2people].

29. And Jonathan knew, and said, [3rids  2father 1My] the land; [2behold 1for 4see  3my eyes] now that I tasted a little something  of this honey.

30. But that if also [4ate 3in eating 5today 1the 2people] of the spoils  of their enemies which they found, now even greater would have been the calamity among the Philistines.

31. And he struck in  that day of the Philistines many in Michmash, and [3tired 1the 2people] exceedingly.

32. And [3advanced 1the 2people] unto the spoils. And [3took 1the 2people] flocks, and herds, and offspring of oxen, and slew them upon the ground, and [3ate them 1the 2people] with the blood.

33. And they reported  to Saul, saying, [3sin 1the 2people] against the lord,  to eat with the blood. And Saul said, You sinned. Roll indeed to me here [2stone 1a great].

34. And Saul said, Be dispersed among the people! And tell them, Bring here each  his calf, and each  his sheep, and slay upon  this stone and eat! and in no way should they sin against the lord  to eat with the blood. And [4brought 1all 2the 3people] each the thing in  his hand in the night, and they slew there.

35. And [2built 1Saul] to the lord an altar; in this Saul began to build an altar to the lord.

36. And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this night, and we shall tear them into pieces until it should illuminate in the morning; and we should not leave behind among them a man. And they said, All that is good before you, you do! And [3said 1the 2priest], We should come forward here to  God.

37. And Saul asked  God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Shall you deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he did not answer him in  that day.

38. And Saul said, Bring here all the corners  of Israel, and know and behold by whom [2has taken place  1this sin] today!

39. For as the lord lives, the one delivering  Israel, that if the answer be against Jonathan  my son, to death he shall die. And there was no one  answering of all the people.

40. And he said to every man of Israel, You will be for one part, and I and Jonathan  my son will be for one part. And [3said 1the 2people] to Saul, [2the 3good thing 4before 5you 1Do]!

41. And Saul said, O lord  God of Israel, give manifestations! And Saul was chosen by lot and Jonathan, and [3went forth free 1the 2people]. 

42.  The Lot Falls to Jonathan And Saul said, Throw the lot between me and between Jonathan  my son, whomever the lord should choose by lot let him die! And they threw lots between him and between Jonathan, and Jonathan was chosen by lot.

43. And Saul said to Jonathan, Report to me what you have done! And [2reported 3to him 1Jonathan], saying, In tasting, I tasted with the tip of the staff, the one in  my hand, a little honey; and behold, I die.

44. And [2said 3to him 1Saul], Thus [2do 3to me  1God], and thus add yet again, that in death [2shall die 3today 1Jonathan].

45. And [3said 1the 2people] to Saul, Shall today [8die 9to death 1the one 2executing  5deliverance  4great 3this 6in 7Israel]? Kindness, as lives the lord, there shall not fall of the hair  of his head upon the ground, for the mercy of God was performed in  this day. And [3prayed 1the 2people] for Jonathan in  that day, and he did not die.

46. And Saul ascended from going after the Philistines. And the Philistines went forth unto  their place.

47. And Saul obtained by lot  to reign over Israel. And he waged war round about with all  his enemies -- against  Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against the sons of Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he was delivered.

48. And he acted powerfully, and he struck  Amalek, and he delivered  Israel from out of the hand of the ones trampling him.

49. And [4were 1the 2sons 3of Saul] Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua. And the names  [2two 3daughters 1of his] -- the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the second was Michal.

50. And the name  of Saul's wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name to his commander-in-chief was Abner son of Ner, son of a member of the family of Saul.

51. And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner son of of Abiel.

52. And [3was 1the 2war] strong against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And Saul in beholding any [2man 1mighty], and any man being a son of power, that he gathered them to himself.  

## 1 Samuel 15

1.  Samuel Instructs Saul to Strike Amalek And Samuel said to Saul, [4me 3has sent 1the 2 lord]  to anoint you as king over Israel  his people. And now hear the voice of the saying of the lord!

2. Thus said the lord of hosts, Now I shall punish what Amalek did  to Israel, when he met him in the way ascending out of Egypt.

3. And now, go! and you shall strike  Amalek, and you shall utterly destroy him, and all the things of his. And you shall devote him to consumption, and all the things of his; and in no way shall you spare over him. And you shall kill from man and unto woman, and from infant and unto one nursing; and from calf and unto sheep, and from camel and unto donkey.

4. And Saul gave exhortation to the people. And he numbered them in Gilgal -- two hundred thousand of the ranks, and ten thousand of the men  of Judah.

5. And Saul came unto the city of Amalek, and laid in wait by the rushing stream.

6. And Saul said to the Kenite, You go forth, and turn away from the midst  of Amalek! lest I add you with him, for you executed mercy with the sons of Israel in  their ascending from out of Egypt. And [3turned away 1the 2Kenite] from the midst of Amalek.

7. And Saul struck  Amalek from Havilah unto Shur at the face of Egypt.

8. And he seized  Agag king of Amalek alive. And all  his people he utterly destroyed by the mouth of the broadsword.

9. And [5preserved 1Saul 2and 3the 4people]  Agag, and the good ones of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the foods, and of the vineyards, and all the good things; and they did not want to utterly destroy them. And every work being a disgrace, and being treated with contempt they utterly destroyed.

10. And came to pass the word of the lord to Samuel, saying,

11. I have changed my mind for Saul to reign as king, for he turned away from following after me; and  my words he did not give heed to. And Samuel was depressed, and yelled to the lord the entire  night.

12. And Samuel rose early and went to meet  Israel in the morning. And it was reported  to Samuel, saying, Saul comes to  Carmel. And behold, he has raised up to himself a hand, and turned  his chariot, and went down into Gilgal. 

13.  Samuel Treats Saul with Contempt And Samuel came to Saul. And [2said 3to him 1Saul], Blessed are you to the lord. I established all as many things as the lord spoke.

14. And Samuel said, And what is the sound  of this flock in  my ears, and the sound of the oxen of which I hear?

15. And Saul said, From out of Amalek I brought them, which [3procured 1the 2people], the most excellent of the flocks and of the herds, so as it may be a sacrifice to the lord  your God, and the rest I utterly destroyed.

16. And Samuel said to Saul, Spare! and I will report to you what the lord spoke to me in the night. And he said to him, Speak!

17. And Samuel said to Saul, Were you not small, even you, before yourself for taking the lead of the chiefdom of the tribes of Israel? And [2anointed 3you 1the lord] for king over Israel.

18. And [2sent 3you 1the lord] on the journey. And he said to you, Go! and utterly destroy  Amalek the ones sinning against me! and you shall war against them until you should have finished them.

19. And why did you not hearken to the voice of the lord, but advanced upon the spoils, and did the wicked thing before the lord?

20. And Saul said to Samuel, Because  of my hearing the sound of the people, and I went in the way in which [2sent 3me 1the lord]. And I brought  Agag, king of Amalek, and  I utterly destroyed Amalek.

21. And [3took 1the 2people] of the spoils of the flocks and the herds, the first-fruits of the offering for consumption,  to sacrifice before the lord  our God in Gilgal.

22. And Samuel said, Does [3want 1the 2 lord] whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as compared  to hearing the voice of the lord, no. Behold, hearkening is better than sacrifice, and  heeding over the fat of rams.

23. For sin is as an omen, [3grief 4and 5miseries 1teraphim 2bring upon]. Because you treated with contempt the word of the lord, even [2treats you with contempt 1the lord] to not be king over Israel.

24. And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, that I violated the word of the lord, and the saying by you; for I feared the people, and I hearkened to  their voice.

25. And now, take away indeed  my sin, and return with me! and I shall do obeisance to the lord  your God.

26. And Samuel said to Saul, I shall not return with you. For you treated with contempt the saying of the lord, and [2shall treat you with contempt 1the lord]  to not be king over Israel.

27. And Samuel turned  his face  to go forth, and Saul took hold of the border  of his doubled garment, and tore it.

28. And [2said 3to 4him 1Samuel], the lord tore  your kingdom from Israel, from out of your hand today, and he shall give it to your neighbor, to the one good over you.

29. And Israel shall be divided into two, and he shall not turn, nor shall [4change his mind 1the 2holy one  3of Israel], for not as a man is he  to change the mind.

30. And Saul said, I have sinned, but glorify me before the elders  of my people, and before  Israel, and return with me! and I will do obeisance to the lord  your God.

31. And Samuel returned behind Saul, and he did obeisance to the lord. 

32.  Samuel Kills Agag King of Amalek And Samuel said, Bring to me  Agag king of Amalek. And [2came forward 3to 4him  1Agag] trembling. And Agag said, Is [2thus 3bitter  1death]?

33. And Samuel said to Agag, As [3made 5childless 4women  2broadsword 1your], thus [3shall be made childless 4among 5women  2mother 1your]. And Samuel slew  Agag in the presence of the lord in Gilgal.

34. And Samuel went forth unto Ramah, and Saul ascended unto  his house in Gibeah.

35. And [2did not 3proceed 1Samuel] to see  Saul until the day of his death, for Samuel mourned over Saul. And the lord repented that Saul reigned over Israel.  

## 1 Samuel 16

1.  Samuel Goes to Jesse at Beth-lehem And the lord said to Samuel, Until when do you mourn for Saul, and I treat him with contempt  to not reign over Israel? Fill  your horn with oil, and come! I shall send you to Jesse, unto Beth-lehem. For I have seen one among  his sons to me for a king.

2. And Samuel said, How should I go, for Saul shall hear and shall kill me? And the lord said, Take in  your hand a heifer of the oxen! And you shall say, [2to sacrifice 3to the 4 lord 1I come].

3. And you shall call  Jesse and  his sons to the sacrifice, and I shall make known to you what you shall do. And you shall anoint to me whom ever I should tell to you.

4. And Samuel did all as much as the lord said. And he came unto Beth-lehem, and startled the elders of the city  meeting him. And they said, [2for peace  1Is your entrance]?

5. And he said, Peace, [2to sacrifice 3to the 4 lord 1I come]. Sanctify yourselves and recline with me today for the sacrifice! And he sanctified  Jesse and  his sons, and he called them to the sacrifice.

6. And it came to pass in  their entering, that he beheld  Eliab, and said, None other than [2is before 3the lord  1his anointed].

7. And the lord said to Samuel, You should not look upon  his appearance, nor unto the manner  of his greatness, for I treat him with contempt; for not as [2shall look 1a man] shall God see. For  man shall see on the surface,  but God shall see into the heart.

8. And Jesse called  Abinadab, and he went by the face of Samuel. And he said, Nor this one the lord chose.

9. And Jesse caused to pass by  Shammah. And he said, Nor in this one the lord chose.

10. And Jesse caused to pass by  [2seven 3sons 1his] before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, [2chose not 1The lord] among these.

11. And Samuel said to Jesse, Have [3ceased 1the 2boys]? And Jesse said, There yet is the lesser, behold, he tends among the flock. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and take him! for in no way shall we lie down to eat until  he comes here. 

12.  Samuel Anoints David And he sent, and brought him. And he was ruddy with beauty of the eyes, and good to the sight. And the lord said to Samuel, Rise up, anoint him! for this it is.

13. And Samuel took the horn  of oil, and he anointed him in the midst  of his brothers. And [3sprang up 1spirit 2of the lord] upon David from  that day and forward. And Samuel rose up and went forth unto Ramah.

14. And spirit of the lord left from Saul, and [5smothered 6him 2spirit 1a ferocious 3from 4the lord].

15. And [4said 1the 2servants 3of Saul] to him, Behold, [2spirit 1a ferocious] from the lord smothers you.

16. Let speak indeed, O lord,  your servants before you! And let them seek  for our lord a man knowing to strum with a lute! And it will be when the [3be 4unto 5you 2spirit 1ferocious] by God, that he should strum with  his lute, and [2good 3to you 1it will be]. 

17.  David Strums before Saul And Saul said to  his servants, Look indeed for me for a man rightly skilled for strumming, and bring him to me!

18. And answered one  of his servant-lads, and said, Behold, I have seen the son  of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, and he knows to strum, and the man is discerning, and a warrior, and wise in word, and the man is good to the sight, and the lord is with him.

19. And Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying, Send out to me David  your son, the one among  your flock.

20. And Jesse took an ass, and put upon it a homer of bread loaves, and a leather bag of wine, and [2kid 3of the goats 1one], and sent them by the hand of David  his son to Saul.

21. And David entered to Saul, and stood before him, and loved him exceedingly. And he became to him the one lifting  his weapons.

22. And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let [2stand 3indeed 1David] before me, for he found favor in my eyes!

23. And it came to pass in the being [3from 4God 2spirit 1a ferocious] upon Saul, that David took the lute, and strummed with  his hand. And Saul was refreshed, and it was good to him, and [4abstained 5from 6him 1the 3spirit  2ferocious].  

## 1 Samuel 17

1.  Goliath Defies Israel And [3gathered together 1the 2Philistines]  their camps for war, and they gathered together at Shochoh  of Judea, and they camped in between Shochoh and between Azekah in Ephes-dammin.

2. And Saul and the men of Israel gathered together, and they camped in the valley of the terebinth tree, these and these. And they deployed for war right opposite the Philistines.

3. And the Philistines stood upon the mountain here on that side. And Israel stood upon the mountain here on this side, and the canyon was between them.

4. And there came forth [2man 1a mighty] from out of the battle array of the Philistines, Goliath was the name to him, from Gath. His height was four cubits and a span.

5. And [2helmet 1a bronze] was upon  his head, and [3a chest plate 4of chain-work 1he 2put on]. And the weight  of his chest plate was five thousand shekels of brass and iron.

6. And  his leg coverings were of brass upon  his legs, and a shield of brass in between  his shoulders.

7. And the shaft  of his spear was as the weaver's beam of one weaving; and  his lance was six hundred shekels of iron. And the one lifting  his weapons went before him.

8. And he stood and yelled out to the battle array of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come forth to deploy for battle right opposite us? [2not 2I 1Am] a Philistine, and you are Hebrews  of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me!

9. And if he should be able to battle against me, and strike me, then we will be to you for servants. But if I shall overpower him, and shall strike him, you will be to us for servants, and you shall serve us.

10. And [3said 1the 2Philistine], Behold, I berate the battle array of Israel today in  this day. Give to me a man, and we will fight [2one on one 1both]!

11. And Saul heard, and all Israel,  [2sayings 3of the 4Philistine 1these], and they were startled, and feared exceedingly. 

12.  David Goes to the Battle Array And David was a son [2man 1of an Ephrathite]; this one was from Beth-lehem Judah, and the name to him was Jesse, and to him were eight sons. And the man was old in days of Saul arriving in the year.

13. And [6went 1the 2three 4sons 5of Jesse  3elder] after Saul unto the war. And the name  of his sons, of the ones having gone unto the war -- Eliab  his first-born, and the second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

14. And David himself was the younger, and the three, the elder went after Saul.

15. And David departed and returned from Saul to tend the sheep  of his father in Beth-lehem.

16. And [3came forward 1the 2Philistines] rising early and arriving late, and set up before Israel forty days.

17. And Jesse said to David  his son, Take indeed to your brothers the ephah  of this toasted grain, and  [2ten 3bread loaves 1these], and run unto the camp to  your brothers.

18. And  [2ten 3cheeses 4of the 5milk 1these] you shall bring to the commander of a thousand, and  [2your brothers 1you shall visit] concerning their peace; and as much as they need you shall know.

19. And Saul, and they, and every man of Israel in the valley of the oak were warring with the Philistines.

20. And David rose early in the morning, and he left the sheep for guard, and he took the things and departed as commanded to him by Jesse. And he came unto the battleline and the army, the one going forth unto the battle array.

21. And they shouted for the war, and Israel deployed, and the Philistines deployed at the opposite of the battle array.

22. And David relieved  his items from himself unto the hand of the provisions officer, and he ran to the battle array, and he came and asked  his brothers the things for peace.

23. And with his speaking with them, and behold, a man in the middle ascended (the name given to him was Goliath the Philistine from Gath) from the battle array of the Philistines, and he spoke according to  these words, and David heard.

24. And every man of Israel in  their seeing the man feared greatly, and fled from his face.

25. And [4said 1a man 2from 3Israel], Did you see the man,  this one ascending? [2so as 3to berate  4Israel 1He ascended]. And it will be a man who ever should strike him, [3shall enrich 4him 1the 2king] [2riches 1in great], and  [2his daughter 1he will give] to him, and the house  of his father he will make free in Israel.

26. And David said to the men, the ones standing with him, saying, What shall be done to the man who ever should strike  that Philistine, and should remove scorn from Israel? For who is  [2Philistine  1this uncircumcised] who berates the battle array of the living God?

27. And [3said 4to him 1the 2people] according to  this word, saying, Thus it shall be done to the man who ever should strike him.

28. And [5heard 1Eliab  4brother 2his  3older] in  his speaking to the men, and [2became angry 3with rage 1Eliab] with  David, and said, Why is this you came down, and for why did you leave  [2small 3sheep 1those] in the wilderness? I know  your pride, and the evil  of your heart; that because of  seeing the war you came down.

29. And David said, What did I do now? [2not 3a word 1Is it]?

30. And he turned from him unto [2rank 1another], and he said thus. And they answered to him according to the word  formerly.

31. And they heard the words of David which he spoke, and they were announced before Saul.

32. And David said to Saul, Let not [4be downcast 1the 2heart  3of my master] over him!  Your servant will go and do battle with  this Philistine.

33. And Saul said to David, In no way shall you be able to go against  this Philistine to battle against him, for you are a boy, and he is a man of war from his youth.

34. And David said to Saul, [3tending 2was  1Your servant] for his father among the flock. And whenever [3came 1the 2lion] and the bear, and it took a sheep from out of the herd,

35. that I went forth after him, and struck him, and pulled it out of  his mouth; and if he rose up against me,  I held  his throat and struck him, and I put him to death.

36. And [3the 4lion 5and 6the 7bear 2beat  1your servant], and [4will be  3Philistine 1this  2uncircumcised] as one of these who berates the battle array of the living God.

37. And David said, The lord who rescued me from out of the hand of the lion, and from out of the hand of the bear, he will rescue me from out of the hand  [2Philistine  1of this uncircumcised]. And Saul said to David, Go and the lord will be with you! 

38.  David Kills Goliath And Saul clothed  David  with his uniform, and [3helmet 2a brass 1put] upon  his head, and clothed him with a chest plate.

39. And David tied on  his sword upon himself. And [2tired 3walking 1David] in the proceeding with them, for he was inexperienced. And David said to Saul, In no way shall I be able to go in these, for I have not tested them; and they removed them from him.

40. And he took  his rod in  his hand, and chose for himself five [2stones 1smooth] from out of the rushing stream. And he put them in the canteen of the shepherd, the one being his, for a collection. And  his sling was in  his hand; and he went forward to the man, the Philistine.

41. And [3went 1the 2Philistine], going and approaching to David. And the man, the one caring the oblong shield was before him. And [3looked 1the 2Philistine].

42. And Goliath beheld  David, and he treated him with contempt, for he was a boy, and he was ruddy with beauty of eyes.

43. And [3said 1the 2Philistine] to David, [2As 3a dog 1Am I] that you come with a rod and stones? And [3cursed 1the 2Philistine]  David by  his gods.

44. And [3said 1the 2Philistine] to David, Come here to me! and I will give  your flesh to the birds  of heaven, and to the wild beasts of the earth.

45. And David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a broadsword, and with a spear, and with a shield. But I come to you in the name of the lord God of hosts, the God of the battle array of Israel, whom you berate today.

46. And [2shall shut you up 1the lord] today by  my hand, and I will kill you, and I will remove  your head from you, and I will give  your carcass and the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines in this  day to the birds of the heaven, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and [4shall know 1all 2the 3earth] that God is in Israel.

47. And [3shall know 1all  2this assembly] that it is not by the broadsword, and spear the lord delivers; for [3is of the 4 lord 1the 2war], and the lord shall deliver you into our hands.

48. And [3rose up 1the 2Philistine], and went and approached to meet with  David. And David hastened, and came forth even himself for the battle array for meeting the Philistine.

49. And David stretched out  his hand into the canteen, and he took from there [2stone 1one], and he slung it, and he struck the Philistine in  his forehead; and [3penetrated 1the 2stone] unto  his forehead; and he fell upon his face upon the ground.

50. And David powered over the Philistine with the sling, and with the stone in  that day. And he struck the Philistine, and he killed him; and a broadsword was not in the hand of David.

51. And David ran and stood over him, and he took  his broadsword, and pulled it out of  its sheath, and he put him to death, and he removed  his head. And [3beheld 1the 2Philistines] that [2has died  1their mighty one], and they fled.

52. And [5rose up 1the men 2of Israel 3and 4Judah], and shouted, and pursued after the Philistines unto  the entrance of Gath, and unto the gate of Ekron. And [4fell 1the slain 2of the 3Philistines] in the way of the gates, and unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

53. And [3returned 1the men 2of Israel] turning aside going after the Philistines, and they plundered  their camps.

54. And David took the head of the Philistine, and he brought it unto Jerusalem. And  his weapons he put in  his tent.

55. And as Saul saw  David going forth for meeting the Philistine, he said to Abner the ruler of the force, Whose son  is this young man, Abner? And Abner responded and said, [2should live  1your soul], O my lord king, I do not know.

56. And the king said, You ask whose son  this young man is?

57. And as David returned having struck the Philistine, [2received 3him 1Abner] and brought him in before Saul. And the head of the Philistine was in  his hand.

58. And [2said 3to 4him 1Saul], Whose son are you young man? And David said, A son  of your servant Jesse  of Beth-lehem.  

## 1 Samuel 18

1.  David Wins Acclaim from All Israel And it came to pass as he finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was bound together to the soul of David; and [2loved 3him 1Jonathan] according to  his own soul.

2. And [2received 3him 1Saul] in  that day, and he did not allow him to return to the house  of his father.

3. And [4ordained 1Jonathan 2and 3David] a covenant, for he loved him according to  his soul.

4. And Jonathan took off the outer garment, the one upon him, and he gave it to David, and  his uniform,  unto  his broadsword, and the bow, and  his belt.

5. And David went forth perceiving in all what ever [2sent 3him 1Saul]. And [2placed 3him 1Saul] over the men of war. And he pleased in the eyes of all the people, and also even in the eyes of the manservants of Saul.

6. And it came to pass in  his entering, when David returned striking the Philistine, that [2came forth 1the women] joining in a dance and singing, to meet Saul the king from out of all the cities of Israel, with tambourines, and with joyfulness, and with cymbals.

7. And [3took the lead 1the 2women]  playing, and said, Saul struck  his thousands, and David  his ten thousands.

8. And Saul was provoked to anger, and [3appeared as 5sorry state 1the 2thing 4an exceeding] before Saul concerning  this word. And he said, They gave to David the ten thousands, and to me they gave the thousands. And what is there to him besides the kingdom?

9. And Saul was suspecting  David from  that day and beyond.

10. And it came to pass of the next day, that [5fell 2spirit 3from 4God 1a ferocious] upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst  of his house; And David strummed with  his hand as according to each day; and the wooden spear was in the hand of Saul.

11. And Saul lifted the wooden spear and said, I will strike into David and into the wall. And David turned aside from his presence twice.

12. And Saul feared from the face of David, for the lord was with him. And [2from 3Saul 1he left].

13. And [2removed 3him 1Saul] from himself, and placed him to himself as a commander of a thousand. And he went forth and entered before the people.

14. And David was [2in 3all  4his ways 1perceiving], and the lord was with him.

15. And Saul beheld as he perceived exceedingly, and he was cautious of his person.

16. And all Israel and Judah loved  David, for he entered and went forth before the face of the people.

17. And Saul said to David, Behold,  my daughter, the elder, Merab. I will give her to you for a wife, only become to me for a son of power, and wage war of the battles of the lord! And Saul said, Let not [2be  1my hand] upon him, but let [5be 6on 7him 1the 2hand 3of the 4Philistines]!

18. And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is the life of the kin  of my father in Israel, that I shall be an in-law of the king?

19. And it came to pass in the time of the giving  Merab daughter of Saul to David, that he gave her to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.

20. And [5loved 1Michal 2the 3daughter 4of Saul]  David. And it was reported  to Saul, and [3was pleasing 4in  5his eyes 1the 2thing].

21. And Saul said, I will give her to him, and she shall be to him for an obstacle, and [3shall be 4upon 5him 1the hand 2of the Philistines]. And Saul said to David a second time, You shall ally to me by marriage today.

22. And Saul gave charge to his servants, saying, You speak in private  to David, saying, Behold, [3want 4is towards 5you 1the 2king's], and all  his servants love you, and thus you be allied by marriage to the king!

23. And [4spoke 1the 2servants 3of Saul] into the ears of David  these things. And David said, [2the 3light thing 1Is it] in your eyes to be allied by marriage to the king? And I am [2man 1a humble], and not esteemed?

24. And [4reported 1the 2servants 3of Saul] to him according to  these words which David spoke.

25. And Saul said, Thus shall you say  to David, [3does not 4want 1The 2king] a dowry, but only a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to avenge against the enemies of the king. And Saul devised to put  David into the hands of the Philistines.

26. And [4told 1the 2servants 3of Saul] to David  these things. And [3was straightened 1the 2word] in the eyes of David to be allied by marriage to the king. And [3were not fulfilled 1the 2days].

27. And David rose up and went himself and  his men, and he struck among the Philistines two hundred men. And he brought  their foreskins, and fulfilled them to the king; and he becomes allied by marriage to the king; and [2gives 3to him 1Saul]  Michal his daughter for a wife.

28. And Saul beheld and knew that the lord was with David. And Michal  his daughter and all Israel loved him.

29. And Saul proceeded to fear from before David still. And Saul became hating  David all the days.

30. And [5came forth 1the 2rulers 3of the 4Philistines], and it came to pass from [2fit  3expedition 1their], that David perceived above all the servants of Saul. And [3esteemed  1his name 2was greatly].  

## 1 Samuel 19

1.  Saul Seeks David's Life And Saul spoke to Jonathan  his son, and to all  his servants,  to put David to death.

2. And Jonathan the son of Saul took to  David exceedingly. And Jonathan reported  to David, saying, Saul  my father seeks to put you to death; and now be on guard tomorrow morning, and hide and stay in secret!

3. And I will come forth and stand next to  my father in the field of which ever you should be there. And I will speak concerning you to  my father, and I will see whatever might be, and I will report it to you.

4. And Jonathan spoke concerning David good things to Saul  his father, and said to him, [4not 1Let 5sin 2the 3king] against  his servant  David! for he sinned not against you, and  his works [2proper 1are exceedingly].

5. And he put  his life in  his hand, and struck the Philistine. And the lord executed [2deliverance 1a great]. And all Israel beheld and rejoiced. And why do you sin against [2blood 1innocent] to put to death  David without charge?

6. And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore by an oath, saying, As the lord lives shall he die, no.

7. And Jonathan called  David, and reported to him all  these things. And Jonathan brought  David to Saul, and he was before him as he was yesterday and the third day before.

8. And [3proceeded 1the 2war] to take place, and David grew strong and waged war against the Philistines; and he struck them [3beating 2great 1an exceedingly]; and they fled from his face.

9. And [4came 2spirit 3of the lord 1a ferocious] upon Saul from the lord, and he was in his house sitting, and a spear was in  his hand. And David strummed with  his hands.

10. And Saul sought to strike [2with 3a wooden spear  1David]. And David departed from the face of Saul, and he struck with the spear into the wall. And David withdrew and was delivered in that night.

11. And Saul sent messengers to the house of David to guard him, so as to put him to death in the morning. And it was reported  to David by Michal  his wife, saying, If you shall not preserve  your life  this night, tomorrow you shall be put to death.

12. And Michal let down  David through the window. And he went forth, and fled, and escaped.

13. And Michal took the statues, and put them upon the bed; and a round pillow of hair of goats she put by his head, and covered them with a cloak.

14. And Saul sent messengers to take  David. And she spoke of him to be unwell. 

15.  David Flees to Samuel at Ramah And Saul sent messengers to see  David, saying, Lead him upon the bed to me  to put him to death.

16. And [3come 1the 2messengers], and behold, the statues upon the bed, and round pillow  of hair of the goats by his head.

17. And Saul said  to Michal, Why thus did you mislead me, and send out  my enemy, and he came through safe? And Michal said  to Saul, He said to me, Send me! for if not I shall put you to death.

18. And David fled, and was delivered, and comes to Samuel in Ramah. And he reports to him all as much as [2did 3to him 1Saul]. And [4went 1Samuel 2and 3David] and stayed in Naioth in Ramah.

19. And it was reported  to Saul, saying, Behold, David is in Naioth in Ramah.

20. And Saul sent messengers to take  David. And coming they saw the assembly of the prophets  prophesying, and Samuel stood ordained over them. And [3became 4upon 5the 6messengers 7of Saul 1spirit 2of God], and they prophesied, even they.

21. And it was reported  to Saul, and he sent [2messengers 1other], and they prophesied, even they. And Saul proceeded to send messengers a third time, and they prophesied -- even they.

22. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1Saul], and went even himself unto Ramah. And he comes unto well of the threshing-floor of the one in  Sechu. And he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And they said, Behold, in Naioth in Ramah.

23. And he went from there into Naioth in Ramah. And there came upon him spirit of God. And he went going, and prophesied unto  his coming unto Naioth in Ramah.

24. And he took off  his clothes, and he prophesied before Samuel. And he fell naked [2entire  3day 1that], and [2entire  3night 1that]. Because of this they said, Is also Saul among the prophets?  

## 1 Samuel 20

1.  Jonathan and David Make a Covenant And David ran away from Naioth in Ramah, and he came before Jonathan. And he said, What have I done, and what is  my offence, and how have I sinned before  your father, that he seeks anxiously  my life?

2. And [2said 3to him 1Jonathan], Far be it to you. In no way shall you die. Behold, in no way shall [2do  1my father] a thing, great or small, and shall not reveal it in  my ear. And why  shall [2hide  1my father] from me  this thing? [3not 2is 1This] so.

3. And David answered  Jonathan, and he said, In perceiving, [2sees  1your father] that I have found favor in your eyes. And he said, Let not [2know 3this 1Jonathan], lest he should prefer him! But as lives the lord, and as lives  your soul, that as I said, the space is filled up between me and between  your father unto death.

4. And Jonathan said to David, What does [2desire  1your soul], and what should I do for you?

5. And David said to Jonathan, Behold indeed, it is a new moon tomorrow, and I in sitting should sit down with the king to eat. And you shall send me, and I shall be hid in the plain until afternoon.

6. If in numbering [2should number 3me missing  1your father], then you shall say, In asking pardon [2asks pardon 3of 4me 1David] to run unto  Beth-lehem  his city, for the sacrifice of the feast days is there for the entire  tribe.

7. If thus he should say, Fine, then it will be peace to your servant. And if harshly he should answer to you, know that [2is completed  1evil] by him!

8. And you will do mercy with  your servant, for you brought  your servant into a covenant of the lord with yourself. And if there is injustice in  your servant, [2put me to death 1you]! And [5unto  6your father 1why 2thus 3should you bring 4me]?

9. And Jonathan said, Far be it to you; for if in knowing I should know that [3is completed 1the 2evil] by  my father  to come against you, then would I not report it to you?

10. And David said to Jonathan, Who shall report to me if [2should answer  1your father] harshly?

11. And Jonathan said to David, You go! for we should go out in the field. And they went forth both into the field.

12. And Jonathan said to David, The lord  God of Israel knows that I will question  my father according to [2time 1a third]. And behold, if it should be good for David, then in no way shall I send to you in the field.

13. Thus God do  to Jonathan, and thus add to it, if I will not bring the evils unto you, and I will uncover  your ear, and I will send you, and you will go in peace. And the lord will be with you, as he was with  my father.

14. And if during my living you shall do [3with 4me 1mercy 2of the lord], even if in death I should die,

15. you shall not remove your mercy from  my house unto the eon. And not even in the removing by the lord of the enemies of David, each from the face of the earth,

16. shall [2be lifted away  1Jonathan] from the house of David, even if the lord should require from the hands of the enemies of David.

17. And Jonathan proceeded to swear by an oath to David, because of the loving him, for he loved the soul loving him. 

18.  Jonathan Helps David to Escape And [2said 3to him 1Jonathan], Tomorrow is a new moon, and overseeing [2shall be watched  1your chair].

19. And you shall do it three times, and you shall watch, and you shall come into the place where you may hide there in the day of the deed, and you shall sit down by  that stone.

20. And I shall be three times in the [2darts 1shooting], and sending them forth to the mark.

21. And behold, I shall send the servant-lad, saying, Come find to me the dart! If I should say to the servant-lad, Here is the dart away from you here, take it! then you come, for peace shall be to you, and there is no bad communication; as lives the lord.

22. But if thus I should say to the young man, Here is the dart, away from you and beyond. Go! for [2sends 3you out 1the lord].

23. And concerning the word which we have spoken, I and you, behold, the lord is witness between me and you unto the eon.

24. And David was hidden in the field. And it became a new moon, and [3comes 1the 2king] unto the table  to eat.

25. And [3sat 1the 2king] upon  his chair as once and once before that, upon the chair by the wall. And [2went beforehand by 3him 1Jonathan], and Abner sat by the side  of Saul. And [4was watched 1the 2place  3of David].

26. And [2did not 3say 1Saul] anything in  that day, for he said, A coincidence, for he appears [2not 4clean 1to 3be], for he has not cleansed himself.

27. And it came to pass in the next day of the month, the [2day  1second], and [4was watched 1the 2place  3of David]. And Saul said to Jonathan  his son, Why is it that he has not come, the son of Jesse, even yesterday and today unto the table?

28. And Jonathan answered  Saul, and said, [2asks pardon 3of 4me 1David], so as [2to 3Beth-lehem  4his city 1to go].

29. And he said, Send me indeed, for [2a sacrifice 3of the 4tribe 1we have] in the city, and [2gave charge 3for 4me  1my brethren]. And now if I have found favor in your eyes, I will go forth indeed and see  my brethren. On account of this he does not come unto the table of the king.

30. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1Saul] at Jonathan exceedingly, and said to him, O son [2woman 1of a deserting], [3not 1for 2do you] know that you are a partner to the son of Jesse for your shame, and for the shame of uncovering your mother?

31. For all the days which the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, you shall not be prepared, you nor  your kingdom. Now then, send and take the young man! for [2a son 3of death 1he is].

32. And Jonathan responded to Saul his father, and said, Why does he die? What has he done?

33. And Saul lifted up the spear against Jonathan  to put him to death. And Jonathan knew that [2has been completed  1this evil] by  his father  to put David to death.

34. And Jonathan jumped up from the table in anger of rage. And he did not eat bread on the second day of the month, for he was devastated for  David, for [2planned  1his father] to finish him off.

35. And it became morning, and Jonathan came forth into the field as he gave order for the testimony to David, and [2servant-lad 1the small] was with him.

36. And he said to the servant-lad, You run and find for me the darts which I shall shoot! And the servant-lad ran. And he shot the arrow, and it passed by him.

37. And [3came 1the 2servant-lad] unto the place of the arrows which Jonathan shot. And Jonathan yelled out after the boy, and said, [3is there 1the 2dart] away from you and beyond.

38. And Jonathan yelled out after  his servant-lad, saying, In hastening, you hasten! for you should not stand. And [4gathered up 1the 2servant-lad 3of Jonathan] the darts, and he brought the darts to  his master.

39. And the servant-lad did not know anything, only Jonathan and David knew the thing.

40. And Jonathan gave  his weapons to  his servant-lad, and said to his servant-lad, Go, enter into the city!

41. And as [3entered the city 1the 2servant-lad], then David rose up from the chest, and fell upon his face upon the ground, and did obeisance to him three times. And [2kissed 1each]  his dear one, and [2wept 1each] over  his dear one unto [4finale 3of a great 1David 2exceeded].

42. And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace! And as we swore by an oath, both of us in the name of the lord, saying, The lord will be witness between me and you, and between  my seed and  your seed, unto the eon. And David rose up and went forth. And Jonathan entered into the city.  

## 1 Samuel 21

1.  David Goes to Ahimelech the Priest And David comes to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech is startled in the meeting David. And he said to him, Why is it that you are alone, and no one is with you?

2. And David said to the priest Ahimelech, The king gave charge to me a thing today, and said to me, Let no one know anything concerning the matter for which I send you, and for what I have given charge to you. And to the servants I testified in the place, in the one being called -- Phalanni Alomni.

3. And now, if there is in  your hand five bread loaves, put into  my hand the thing being found.

4. And [3responded 1the 2priest]  to David, and said, There are no profane bread loaves in  my hand, but [2only 4bread loaves 3holy 1there are]. If [3were having been kept 1the 2servants] from a woman, then they shall eat.

5. And David answered to the priest, and said to him, Yes, even from a woman we have been at a distance from  yesterday and the third day before. In  my coming forth for the journey [4have been 1all 2the 3servants] purified; but this  journey is profane, for today it shall be sanctified on account of  my weapons.

6. And [4gave 5to him 1Ahimelech 2the 3priest] bread loaves of the place setting, for there was no [2there 1bread loaf], but only bread loaves of the presence, the loaves being removed before the presence of the lord, so as to place near [2bread loaves 1the hot] in which day he took them.

7. And there was a certain one there of the servants of Saul in  that day, being held before the lord, and the name to him was Doeg the Edomite, feeding the mules of Saul.

8. And David said to Ahimelech, See if there is here under  your hand a spear or broadsword! for  my broadsword and  my weapons I have not taken in  my hand, for the matter of the king was in haste.

9. And [3said 1the 2priest], Behold, the broadsword of Goliath the Philistine whom you struck in the valley of Ela. And it is wrapped in a cloak behind the shoulder-piece. If this you take for yourself, take! for there is none other besides it here. And David said, There is none as it, give it to me! 

10.  David Goes to Achish King of Gath And he gave it to him. And David rose up and fled in  that day from the presence of Saul. And David came to Achish king of Gath.

11. And [4said 1the 2servants 3of Achish] to him, [3not 2this Is] David the king of the land? Did not [3to this one 4taking the lead 1the 2women joining in a dance], saying, Saul struck  his thousands, and David  his ten thousands?

12. And David put  these words in  his heart, and feared exceedingly before the face of Achish king of Gath.

13. And he changed  his countenance before them. And carried about with  his hands, and fell upon the doors of the gateway, and  his saliva flowed down upon  his beard.

14. And Achish said to  his servants, Behold, you see a man overcome by convulsions! Why did you bring him to me?

15. Or do [2feel a want 3of ones overcome by convulsions 1I] that you carry him being possessed unto me? Shall this one enter into  my house, no.  

## 1 Samuel 22

1.  David Gathers a Band of Outcasts And David went forth from there, and came through safe. And he comes to the cave  of Odollam, and [2hear  1his brethren], and all the house  of his father, and they went down to him there.

2. And gathered together with him every one in necessity, and every debtor, and all in severe pain of the soul; and he was over them, taking the lead. And there were with him about four hundred men.

3. And David went forth from there unto Mizpeh  of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, Let indeed  my father and  my mother be by you, until whenever I know what [2shall do 3to me  1God].

4. And he appealed to the person of the king of Moab. And they dwelt with him all the days of David being in the citadel.

5. And [4said 1Gad 2the 3prophet] to David, Do not settle in the citadel. Go! and you shall come into the land of Judah. And David went, and came and settled in the city Hareth.

6. And Saul heard that David was known, and the men  with him. And Saul stayed on the hill by the plowed field, the one in Ramah, and the spear was in  his hand, and all  his servants stood beside him.

7. And Saul said to  his servants, of the ones standing beside him, Hear indeed, O sons of Benjamin! Shall truly [6all 5to you 4give 1the 2son 3of Jesse] fields and vineyards? And [3all 2you 1will he arrange] as commanders of hundreds, and commanders of thousands?

8. For [2situated together 1you are all] against me, and there is not  one uncovering  my ear, in that [2ordains  1my son] a covenant with the son of Jesse. And there is the one toiling for me from you, and uncovering  my ear. For [2raised up  1my son]  my servant against me for an enemy, as  it is this day?

9. And [4answered 1Doeg 2the 3Edomite], the one placed over the mules of Saul. And he said, I saw the son of Jesse coming into Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub the priest.

10. And he asked him concerning  God, and [3provisions 1he gave 2to him]; and the broadsword of Goliath the Philistine he gave to him.

11. And [3sent 1the 2king] to call  Ahimelech son of Ahitub the priest, and all the sons  of his father of the priests, of the ones in Nob. And they all came to the king.

12. And Saul said, Hear indeed, O son of Ahitub! And he said, Behold, it is I. Speak, O master!

13. And [2said 3to him 1Saul], Why did you agree against me, you and the son of Jesse,  for you to give him bread, and a broadsword, and should ask on his account  of God,  to put him against me for an enemy, as he is  this day?

14. And Ahimelech answered to the king, and said, And who among all  your servants is trustworthy as David, and son-in-law of the king, and one in charge of all your mobilization order, and honorable in  your house?

15. Or today have I begun to ask for him through  God? By no means. Let not [3impute 1the 2king] concerning  [2of his servant 1the word], and against the entire  house  of my father, for [2knew not  1your servant] in any of these things, a matter small or great. 

16.  Ahimelech and the Priests Murdered by Doeg And [3said  1king 2Saul], To death Ahimelech should die, you and all the house  of your father.

17. And [3said 1the 2king] to the bodyguards, to the ones standing by him, Lead forward, and put to death the priests of the lord! for  their hand is with David, for they knew that he fled, and they did not uncover  my ear. And [5would not 1the 2servants 3of the 4king] bear  their hands to encounter against the priests of the lord.

18. And [3said 1the 2king]  to Doeg, You turn, and encounter  the priests! And [4turned 1Doeg 2the 3Edomite], and put to death the priests of the lord in  that day -- eighty-five men, all bearing an ephod.

19. And  Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the mouth of the broadsword, from man unto woman, from infant and unto one nursing, and from calf and donkey and sheep, he struck by the mouth of the broadsword.

20. And [6came through safe 2son 1one  3of Ahimelech 4son 5of Ahitub], and the name to him was Abiathar, and he fled after David.

21. And Abiathar reported to David that Saul put to death all the priests of the lord.

22. And David said to Abiathar, For I knew in  that day, that Doeg the Edomite, that in reporting he would report  to Saul. I am the one at fault for the lives of all the house  of your father.

23. You sit down with me! Do not fear! for where ever I seek  for my life, I shall seek also  [2for your life 1a place]; for you are guarded by me.  

## 1 Samuel 23

1.  David Saves Keilah from the Philistines And they reported to David, saying, Behold, the Philistines wage war in  Keilah, and they tear in pieces the threshing-floors.

2. And David asked of the lord, saying, Shall I go and strike  these Philistines? And the lord said to David, Go! and you shall strike the Philistines, and you shall deliver  Keilah.

3. And [4said 1the 2men  3of David] to him, Behold, we here in  Judea fear. And how will it be if we should go into Keilah unto the valleys of the Philistines?

4. And David proceeded yet to ask of the lord. And [2answered 3him 1the lord], and said to him, Rise up and go down unto Keilah! for I deliver up the Philistines into your hands.

5. And David went, and the men, the ones with him, unto Keilah. And he waged war against the Philistines, and they fled from his face. And he took away  their cattle, and he struck them [2beating 1with a great]. And David delivered the ones dwelling in Keilah.

6. And it came to pass in the fleeing of Abiathar the son of Ahimelech to David in Keilah, he came down having an ephod in  his hand.

7. And it was reported  to Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, [2has sold 3him  1God] into  my hands, for he is locked up, having entered into a city of doors and bars.

8. And Saul exhorted all the people to go down for war to Keilah,  to band together against  David and  his men.

9. And David knew that [2did not 3remain silent 1Saul] concerning him  for evil. And David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod!

10. And David said, O lord, the God of Israel, in hearing hearken to  your servant! for Saul seeks to come against Keilah, to utterly destroy the city on account of me.

11. Shall it be locked up? And now, shall Saul come down as [2heard  1your servant], O lord, the God of Israel? Report to your servant! And the lord said, It shall be locked up.

12. And David said, Shall [4deliver up 1the ones 2from  3Keilah] me and  my men into the hand of Saul? And the lord said, They shall deliver up.

13. And David rose up, and  his men -- about eight hundred. And they went forth from Keilah, and went where ever they could go. And it was reported to Saul that David went safe from Keilah, and he spared  to come forth. 

14.  David Settles in the Wilderness And David stayed in the wilderness, in the narrow passes, and settled in the mountain, in the wilderness of Ziph. And [2sought 3him 1Saul] all the days. And [2did not 3deliver 4him 1the lord] into  his hands.

15. And David knew that Saul went forth  to seek him. And David was in the wilderness Ziph in  New.

16. And [4rose up 1Jonathan 2son 3of Saul], and went to David in New. And he fortified  his hands in the lord.

17. And he said to him, Do not fear! for in no way shall [5find you 1the 2hand 3of Saul  4my father]. And you shall reign over Israel, and I will be to you for second. And Saul  my father knows so.

18. And [2ordained 1both] a covenant before the lord. And David settled in  New, and Jonathan went forth to his house.

19. And [3ascended up 1the 2Ziphites] to Saul, unto the hill, saying, Behold is not David hid by us in the narrows, in  New, in the hill  of Hachilah, of the place at the right  of Jeshimon?

20. And now, every desire  of the soul of the king, [2into 3the descent 1let him go down] to us! They are being uncovered into the hands of the king.

21. And [2said 3to them 1Saul], Being blessed are you to the lord, for you toiled on account of me.

22. You should go indeed and prepare yet, and know and see  his place where [2is  1his foot], quickly, there in that place of which you said, lest at any time he should trick you!

23. And look and know of all the places where he hides there! And return to me at ready! and I shall go with you. And it will be if he is in the land, that I shall search him out among all the thousands of Judah.

24. And [3rose up 1the 2Ziphites], and went before Saul. And David and  his men were in the wilderness  of Maon, to the west at the right  of Jeshimon. 

25.  Saul Pursues David in the Wilderness And Saul went and  his men to seek  David. And they reported  to David. And he went down into the rock, the one in the wilderness of Maon. And Saul heard, and he pursued unto the wilderness  of Maon after David.

26. And Saul went, and  his men by the side  of this mountain, and David and  his men by the other side  of this mountain. And David was sheltering to go from the face of Saul. And Saul and  his men camped by David and  his men --  to seize them.

27. And a messenger came to Saul saying, Hasten and come here, for the Philistines made an attack against the land.

28. And Saul returned to not pursue after David, and he went to meet the Philistines. On account of this [3is called  2place 1that], [3Rock 1The 2Portioned].

29. And David ascended from there and settled in the narrows of En Gedi.  

## 1 Samuel 24

1.  Saul Seeks David's Life at EnGedi And it came to pass as Saul returned from going after the Philistines, that they reported to him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.

2. And he took with himself three thousand [2men 1chosen] from out of all Israel, and he went to seek  David and  his men by the face of the trap of the hinds.

3. And he came unto the herds of the flocks of the ones upon the way. And [2was 3there 1a cave], and Saul entered to make preparation. And David and  his men were in the cave inside sitting down in it. 

4.  David Removes the Border of Saul's Garment And [4said 1the 2men 3of David] to him, Behold, [2the 3day 1this is] which the lord spoke to you, Behold, I give  your enemy into  your hands; and you shall do to him as is good in  your eyes. And David rose up and removed the border of the doubled garment  of Saul clandestinely.

5. And it came to pass after these things, that [2struck 1David's heart] him, for he removed the border  of his double garment.

6. And David said to  his men, By no means be it to me from the lord if I should do  this thing to my master, to the anointed one of the lord, to bear my hand against him, for [3the anointed one 4of the lord 1this 2is].

7. And David persuaded  his men by words, and he did not give in to them to rise up and to put Saul to death. And Saul rose up and went forth into the way from the cave.

8. And David rose up after him from out of the cave. And David yelled after Saul, saying, O Master, O king. And Saul looked up to  his rear. And David bowed upon his face unto the ground, and he did obeisance to him.

9. And David said to Saul, Why do you hearken to the words of the people, saying, Behold, David seeks  your life?

10. Behold, in  this day [2have seen  1your eyes] how [2delivered 3you 1the lord] today into my hands in the cave, and I did not want to kill you, and I spared you. And I said, I will not bear my hand against  my master, for [3the anointed one 4of the lord 1this one 2is].

11. And, O my father, even behold, the border  of your doubled garment in  my hand. I removed the border  of your doubled garment, and I did not kill you. And know and behold today! that there is no evil in  my hand, nor annulment, nor impiety, and I have not sinned against you. But you bind  my life  to take it.

12. May the lord judge between me and you, and may [2render justice 3to me 1the lord] because of you. But my hand will not be against you.

13. As [4says  3parable 1the 2ancient], [3from 4the lawless 2shall come forth 1Trespass]. But  my hand will not be against you.

14. And now, after whom do you go forth, O king  of Israel? After whom do you pursue? After a dog having died, or after [2flea 1one]?

15. May the lord be for a judge and magistrate between me and you. Yes, may the lord behold, and may he judge  my case, and may he adjudicate for me from out of your hand.

16. And it came to pass, as David completed speaking  these things to Saul, that Saul said, Is [2voice 1this your], son David? And Saul lifted up  his voice and wept.

17. And he said to David, You are righteous over me, for you recompensed to me good things, but I recompensed to you evils.

18. And you have reported today what [2you did 3to me 1good things], as how [2locked 3me 1the lord] into  your hands today, and you did not kill me.

19. And that if anyone may find  his enemy in affliction, and shall send him forth in [2way 1a good], even the lord will recompense to him good things, as you have done today.

20. And now, behold, I know that in reigning you shall reign, and [4shall be established 1the 2kingdom 3of Israel] in your hand.

21. And now swear by an oath to me according to the lord, that you should not utterly destroy  my seed after me, and you should not obliterate  my name from the house  of my father.

22. And David swore by an oath  to Saul. And Saul went forth unto  his house. And David and  his men ascended unto Messara the narrows.  

## 1 Samuel 25

1.  Nabal and Abigail And Samuel died; and [3gathered together 1all 2Israel], and lamented him, and entombed him in  his house in Ramah. And David rose up, and went down into the wilderness of Paran.

2. And there was a man in  Maon, and  his work was in  Carmel, and the man [2great 1was exceedingly]. And to this man were [2sheep 1three thousand], and [2goats 1a thousand]. And it happened during the shearing  of his flock in  Carmel.

3. And the name of the man was Nabal, and the name  of his wife was Abigail. And  his wife had good understanding, and was good to the sight, exceedingly. And the man was recalcitrant, and wicked in practices, and the man was churlish.

4. And David heard in the wilderness that [4was shearing 1Nabal 2the 3Carmelite]  his flock.

5. And David sent ten servants. And he said to the servants, Ascend to  Carmel, and come to Nabal, and ask him in  my name the things for peace!

6. And you shall say thus, For a season may it be for you being in health and  your house, and all the things of yours being in health.

7. And now, behold, I hear that [2shear 3for you 4now  1your shepherds], the ones who were with us in the wilderness, and we did not detain them, and we did not give charge to them in anything all the days of their being in  Carmel.

8. Ask  of your servants! and they will tell you.  Let us [2find  1your servants] favor in your eyes! for upon [2day 1a good] we come. Give indeed what ever [2should find  1your hand] to your servants, and to your son David!

9. And [4come 1the 2servants 3of David], and speak to Nabal according to all  these things in the name of David.

10. And Nabal jumped up and responded to the servants of David, and he said, Who is  David, and who is the son of Jesse? Today [3multiplying 1there are  2servants], [2withdrawing 1each] from the presence  of his master.

11. And shall I take  my bread loaves, and  my wine, and  my things offered in sacrifices which I have sacrificed to the ones shearing for me the sheep, and shall I give them to men whom I do not know from what place they are?

12. And [4turned back 1the 2servants 3of David] unto  their way. And they returned, and they came, and they announced  to David according to all  these words.

13. And David said to his men, Let [2tie on 1each man]  his sword! And David even himself tied on  his sword. And they ascended after David, about four hundred men, and two hundred stayed by the equipment.

14. And [5to 6Abigail 7wife 8of Nabal 9reported 1one 2of 3the 4servants], saying, Behold, David sent messengers from out of the wilderness to bless  our master, and he turned aside from them.

15. And the men were good to us, exceedingly. And they did not detain us, nor charged to us anything all the days which we were by them, in  our being in the field.

16. [2as 3a wall 1They were] for us, both  day and  night, all the days of our being with them and tending the flocks.

17. And now perceive and see what you shall do! for [2is completed  1evil] against  our master, and against  his house; and he is a son of pestilence, and there is no way to speak to him.

18. And Abigail hastened, and took two hundred bread loaves, and two receptacles of wine, and five sheep prepared, and five ephahs of toasted grains, and [2homer 1one] of dried grapes, and two hundred dried clusters of figs; and she put them upon the donkeys.

19. And she said to her servants, You go forth in front of me! and behold, I [2after 3you 1come]. But to her husband Nabal she did not report.

20. And it came to pass of her being mounted upon the donkey, that she went down in the protection of the mountain. And behold, David and  his men went down to meet her, and she met them.

21. And David said, Perhaps it was unjust I guarded all the things  of Nabal in the wilderness, and asked not to take of any  of his things -- nothing. And he recompensed to me evil for good.

22. Thus God do to the enemies to David, and thus may he add, if I leave behind of all of the ones of Nabal unto the morning of ones urinating against the wall. 

23.  Abigail Intercedes And Abigail saw  David, and hastening she came down from the donkey, and fell before David upon her face, and did obeisance to him upon the ground.

24. And [2by  3his feet 1she fell], and she said, On me, O my lord, be the injustice. Let [3speak 1indeed  2your maidservant] into  your ears, and you hear the words  of your maidservant! 

25.  Abigail Prophesies before David Let not indeed [2put  1my master]  his heart against  [2man  1this pestilent], against Nabal! For according to  his name, thus is he Nabal. His name, and folly is with him. And I  your maidservant did not see the servants  of my master whom you sent.

26. And now, O my lord, as the lord lives, and as [2lives  1your soul], as [2restrained 3you 1the lord]  to not come against [2blood 1innocent], and to deliver  your hand for yourself. And now may [2become 3as 4Nabal  1your enemies], and the ones seeking [2against 3my lord 1bad things].

27. And now receive  this blessing which [2has brought  1your maidservant] to my master! and you shall give it to the servants  standing beside  my master.

28. Take away indeed the violation  of your maidservant! for in doing, the lord shall make  [3for my master 2house 1a trustworthy], for [4the battle 5for my master 1the 2 lord 3shall wage], and evil shall not be found in you at any time.

29. And if [2should rise up 1a man] to pursue you, and seeking  your life, that [4will be 1the 2life 3of my master] bound in a bond  of life by the lord  God; and the life  of your enemies you shall sling as in the midst of the sling.

30. And it shall be whenever the lord shall do for my master, according to all [2which 3he spoke 1good things] concerning you, that [2shall give charge 3to you 1the lord] for taking the lead over Israel.

31. Then [5shall not 6be 7against your 1this 2abomination 3and 4obstacle] heart, to my master, to pour out [2blood 1innocent] without charge, and to deliver the hand of my master for himself. And the lord shall do good to my master. And you shall remember  your maidservant,  [2well 1to do] to her.

32. And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the lord  God of Israel, who sent you [3day 1in 2this] to meet me.

33. And blessed be  your manner, and blessed be you to detain me today in this, to not come for blood, and to deliver my hand from myself.

34. Only as lives the lord  God of Israel, who detained me today  of doing evil to you, that unless you hastened and came to meet me, not would there have been left behind to Nabal unto the light of the morning one urinating against the wall.

35. And David took from her hand all which she brought to him. And he said to her, Ascend in peace to  your house. See, I hearkened to  your voice, and I took up  your person!

36. And Abigail came to Nabal. And behold, there was to him a banquet in  his house, as the banquet of a king. And the heart of Nabal was good with him, and he was being intoxicated exceedingly. And [2did not 3report 1Abigal] to Nabal the thing, great or small, until the light of the morning.

37. And it came to pass in the morning as [2sobered up 3from 4the 5wine 1Nabal], [2reported 3to him  1his wife] all  these things. And [3died  2heart 1his] in him, and he became as stone. 

38.  David Marries Abigail And it came to pass after about ten days, that the lord struck  Nabal and he died.

39. And David heard that Nabal died, and he said, Blessed be the lord who judged the case  of my being scorned by the hand of Nabal, and  [2his servant 1protected] from out of the hand of evils. And the evil of Nabal the lord returned against  his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to himself for a wife.

40. And [4came 1the 2servants 3of David] to Abigail in  Carmel. And they spoke to her, saying, David sends us to you, to take you to himself for a wife.

41. And rising, she did obeisance upon her face upon the ground. And she said, Behold,  your maidservant is for a girl to wash the feet of the servants  of my master.

42. And [2hastened 3and 4rose up 1Abigail], and mounted upon the donkey, and five of her young women followed her. And she went after the servants of David, and became to him for a wife.

43. And  [3Ahinoam 2took 1David] of Jezreel; and both were his wives.

44. And Saul gave Michal  his daughter, the wife of David, to Phalti son of Laish, the one of Gallim.  

## 1 Samuel 26

1.  Saul Seeks David's Life in the Wilderness And [3come 1the 2Ziphites] to the hill to Saul, saying, Behold, David is sheltered with us in the hill  of Hachilah,  against the face  of Jeshimon.

2. And Saul rose up, and went down unto the wilderness of Ziph, and with him three thousand [2men 1chosen] of Israel,  to seek  David in the wilderness of Ziph.

3. And Saul camped in the hill  of Hachilah, against the face of Jeshimon,  upon the way. And David stayed in the wilderness. And David saw that Saul comes after him into the wilderness.

4. And David sent spies, and he knew that Saul was come prepared from there.

5. And David rose up in private, and went into the place where [2was sleeping 3there 1Saul]. And David saw the place where [2went to bed 3there 1Saul]. And Abner son of Ner his commander-in-chief was there. And Saul was sleeping in the royal chariot, and the people were camping round about him.

6. And David responded and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, Who shall enter with me to Saul, into the camp? And Abishai said, I shall enter with you. 

7.  David Takes Saul's Spear And they enter, David and Abishai, among the people  at night. And behold, Saul was sleeping a deep sleep in the royal chariot, and  his spear was sticking in the ground by his head, and Abner and the people slept round about him.

8. And Abishai said to David, the lord locked up today  your enemy into your hands. And now I shall indeed strike him with the spear into the earth once, and I should not repeat it a second time against him.

9. And David said to Abishai, you should not utterly destroy him. For who shall bear his hand against the anointed one of the lord, and be acquitted?

10. And David said, As the lord lives, that if the lord should not smite him, or  his day should come and he should die, or by battle should go down and be added to his fathers;

11. then it is by no means to me from the lord to bear my hand against the anointed one of the lord. And now, take indeed the spear from before his head, and the flask of the water, and we shall go forth.

12. And David took the spear and the flask of the water from before his head, and they went forth. And there was not one seeing, and there was not one knowing, and there was not one awakening -- all were sleeping, for a stupefaction from the lord fell upon them.

13. And David passed over to the other side, and stood upon the top of the mountain far off, and a long  way between them.

14. And David called the people, and  he spoke to Abner son of Ner, saying, Will you not answer, Abner? And Abner answered and said, Who are you,  calling me?

15. And David said to Abner, Are [2not 3a man 1you]? And who is as you in Israel? And why do you not guard  your master the king? For [5entered 1one 2of 3the 4people] to destroy  your master the king.

16. [2is not 3a good  4thing 1this] which you have done. As lives the lord, for [2sons 3of death 1you are], the ones not guarding the king,  your master, the anointed one of the lord. And now see where [5is 1the 2spear 3of the 4king], and the flask of the water, the things by his head!

17. And Saul recognized the voice of David, and he said,  [2your voice 1Is this] son David? And David said, My voice my master; your servant, O king.

18. And he said, Why is this [2pursues  1my master] after  his servant? For in what have I sinned? And what [2was found 3in 4me 1offence]?

19. And now let [4hear 5indeed  1my master 2the 3king] the words  of his servant! If  God stirs you against me, then may [2smell acceptable  1your sacrifice]. And if the sons of men, then let these be accursed before the lord, for they cast me out today to not be fixed firmly in the inheritance of the lord, saying, Go serve other gods!

20. And now [3not 1may 4fall  2my blood] upon the ground right opposite the face of the lord, that [4has come forth 1the 2king 3of Israel] to seek [2flea 1one], as [3pursues prey 1the 2long-eared owl] in the mountains.

21. And Saul said, I have sinned. Return, son David! for I shall not do evil against you any more, because [2was valued 1my life] in your eyes; and   today I have acted in folly, and I am ignorant [2much 1very].

22. And David responded and said, Behold, the spear of the king. Let [5come through 1indeed 2one 3of the 4servants] and take it!

23. And the lord will restore to each  his righteousness and  his trust; as [2delivered 3you 1the lord] today into my hands, and I did not want to bear my hand against the anointed one of the lord.

24. And behold, as [2was magnified  1your life] today in this, in my eyes, so may [2be magnified  1my life] before the lord, and may he shelter me, and may he rescue me from out of all affliction.

25. And Saul said to David, Being blessed are you, son David, and by performing you shall perform, and in ability you shall be able. And David went forth on  his way, and Saul returned to  his place.  

## 1 Samuel 27

1.  David Dwells in Ziklag And David said in  his heart, saying, Now I shall be added in [2day 1one] into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing to me unless I should come through safe into the land of the Philistines, and [2should spare 3of 4me 1Saul],  seeking me in every border of Israel, and thus I shall be delivered from out of his hand.

2. And David rose up and passed over, he and the six hundred men  with him, and he went to Achish, son of Maoch, king of Gath.

3. And David sat with Achish in Gath, he and  his men, each also  with his house, and David and both  of his wives -- Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

4. And it was announced  to Saul that David fled into Gath, and he did not proceed any longer to seek him.

5. And David said to Achish, If indeed [2has found  1your servant] favor in your eyes, give indeed to me a place in one of the cities of the ones in the country! and I shall settle there. For why [2settle  1does your servant] in a city reigning with you?

6. And [2gave 3to him 1Achish] in  that day  Ziklag. Because of this Ziklag came to the king  of Judea until  this day.

7. And came to pass the number of the days which David stayed in the country of the Philistines -- four months.

8. And David ascended and  his men, and they made an attack upon the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and against the Amalekites. For [3was inhabited 1the 2land] by the one from Shur and unto the land of Egypt.

9. And he struck the land, and did not bring forth alive man or woman; and they took flocks, and herds, and donkeys, and camels, and clothes. And they returned and came to Achish.

10. And Achish said to David, Upon whom did you attack today? And David said to Achish, To the south  in Judea, and to the south of Jerahmeel, and to the south of the Kenite.

11. And [4a man 5and 6woman 2did not 3bring forth alive 1David]  to bring unto Gath, saying, Lest they announce against us, saying, Thus David does. And thus  was his ordinance all the days which David settled in the country of the Philistines.

12. And David was trusted by  Achish, saying, With shame he is being shamed by  his people in  Israel, and he will be my a servant into the eon.  

## 1 Samuel 28

1.  David Appointed Bodyguard for Achish And it came to pass in  those days that [3were gathered together 1the 2Philistines] in  their camps  to come forth for war against  Israel. And Achish said to  David, In knowing you shall know that with me you shall go forth unto the war, you and  your men.

2. And David said to Achish, Thus now you shall know what [2will do  1your servant]. And Achish said to  David, Thus as chief of the body-guard I shall appoint you for all the days.

3. And Samuel died, and [3lamented 4him 1all 2Israel], and they entombed him in Ramah, in  his city. And Saul removed the ones who deliver oracles, and the diviners from the land.

4. And [3gather together 1the 2Philistines], and come, and camp in Shunem. And Saul gathers together every man of Israel, and they camp in Gilboa.

5. And Saul beheld the camp of the Philistines, and he was fearful, and it startled  his heart exceedingly.

6. And Saul asked through the lord. And [2did not 3answer 4to him 1the lord] in  dreams, nor in the manifestations, nor among the prophets. 

7.  Saul and the Oracle in En-dor And Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who delivers oracles! and I will go to her, and I will inquire by her. And [2said  1his servants] to him, Behold, a woman who delivers oracles is in En-dor.

8. And Saul changed appearance, and put around [2garments 1other], and he himself goes and two men with him. And they come to the woman by night, and he said to her, Use oracles indeed for me by the delivering an oracle, and lead up to me whom ever I should tell you!

9. And [3said 1the 2woman] to him, Behold, you know as much as Saul did, as he utterly destroyed the ones delivering up oracles, and the diviners from the land. And why do you ensnare  my life to put it to death?

10. And [2swore by an oath 3to her 1Saul] according to  God, saying, As lives the lord, shall [2meet up 3with you 1injustice] in  this matter? No!

11. And [3said 1the 2woman]  to Saul, Whom should I lead up to you? And he said,  Lead up Samuel to me!

12. And [3beheld 1the 2woman]  Samuel, and she yelled [2voice 1with a great]. And [3said 1the 2woman] to Saul, Why did you mislead me, even you are Saul?

13. And [3said 4to her 1the 2king], Do not fear! Whom do you see? And [3said 1the 2woman] to Saul, I see magistrates ascending from out of the earth.

14. And he said to her, What did you perceive? And she said to him, An aged man ascending being cloaked in a double-garment. And Saul knew that this was Samuel. And he bowed upon the face upon the ground, and he did obeisance to him.

15. And Samuel said, Why did you give trouble to me to cause me to ascend? And Saul said, I am afflicted very much, and the Philistines wage war with me, and  God has left from me, and he does not heed me any longer, nor by the hand of the prophets, nor by  dreams. And now I call you  to make known to me what I should do.

16. And Samuel said, Why do you ask me, and the lord has left from you, and has taken place with  your neighbor?

17. And the lord has done to you as he said by my hand. And the lord will tear the kingdom from out of your hand, and will give it to your neighbor, to David.

18. Because you hearkened not to the voice of the lord, and you did not fill [2rage 3of anger 1his] against  Amalek; on account of  this thing the lord did to you thus in this day.

19. And the lord will deliver up  Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and  your sons will be with with me. And [2the 3camp 4of Israel 1the lord will put] into the hands of the Philistines.

20. And Saul hastened, and fell full stop upon the ground, and feared very much from the words of Samuel. And there was no [2in 3him 1strength] any longer, for he did not eat bread all  that day, and all the night.

21. And [3entered 1the 2woman] to Saul, and beheld that he hastened very much. And she said to him, Behold, [2hearkened to  1your maidservant]  your voice, and I put  my life in  my hand, and I hearkened to  your words which you spoke to me.

22. And now hear indeed the voice  of your maidservant, for I will place before you a morsel of bread and you eat! and it will be for strength to you, that you should go in the way.

23. And he resisted persuasion, and he did not want to eat. And they pressed him,  his servants and the woman. And he hearkened to  their voice, and he rose up from the ground, and he sat upon the chair.

24. And to the woman was [2calf 1a suckling] by the house; and she hastened and sacrificed it, and took flour and mixed it, and baked unleavened breads.

25. And she brought it before Saul, and before  his servants, and they ate. And rising up they went forth  that night.  

## 1 Samuel 29

1.  The Philistines War with Israel And [2gathered 1the 1Philistines] all  their camps unto Aphek. And Israel camped in En-dor, the one in Jezreel.

2. And the satraps of the Philistines came by the hundreds and thousands. And David and  his men came near at the last with Achish.

3. And [5said 1the 2satraps 3of the 4Philistines], Who are  these traveling? And Achish said to the satraps of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me some days this second year. And I have not found in him any fault from which days he fell in with me until  this day.

4. And [5were enraged 6over 7him 1the 2satraps 3of the 4Philistines], and they say to him, Return the man! and let him return unto  his people of which you placed him there, and do not let him come with us to the battle, and let him not become a plotter in the camp! And how shall he be reconciled to his master? Will it not be with the heads  of those men?

5. Is this not David, which they led in dances, saying, Saul struck  his thousands, and David  his ten thousands?

6. And Achish called  David, and said to him, As the lord lives, know that you are upright and good in my eyes, and so is your exiting and  your entering with me in the camp. For I did not find against you an evil from which day you came to me until  this day. But in the eyes of the satraps [2not 3good 1you are].

7. And now, return and go in peace! and in no way shall you do evil in the eyes of the satraps of the Philistines.

8. And David said to Achish, What have I done to you? And what did you find in  your servant from which day I was before you, and until this day, that in no way I should come to wage war against the enemies  of my master the king?

9. And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my eyes, as an angel of God, but the satraps of the Philistines say, He shall not come with us to war.

10. And now, rise early in the morning, you and the servants  of your master, the ones having come with you, and go to the place where I placed you there! And you rise early in the journey, and when it gives light to you then go!

11. And David rose early, he and  his men  to go forth in the morning, and to guard the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines ascended to wage war against Israel.  

## 1 Samuel 30

1.  Amalek Burns Ziklag and Takes Captives And it came to pass in the entering of David and  of his men  to Ziklag, on the [2day  1third], that Amalek made an attack upon the south, and upon  Ziklag. And it struck  Ziklag, and burnt it with fire.

2. And the women, and all the ones in it, from small unto great they did not put to death, man nor woman, but they took them captive, and went forth in  their way.

3. And [4came 1David 2and  3his men] unto the city, and, behold, it was burnt with fire;  and their wives, and  their sons, and  their daughters, were taken captive.

4. And [4lifted 1David 2and  3his men]  their voice, and they wept until whenever there was no strength in them  to weep any longer.

5. And both the wives of David were captured -- Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

6. And David was afflicted very much, for [3said 1the 2people] to stone him, for [4were in severe pain 5of soul 1all 2the 3people], each over  his sons, and over  his daughters. And David was fortified by the lord his God.

7. And David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, Lead forward the ephod. And Abiathar led forward the ephod to David.

8. And David asked through the lord, saying, Shall I pursue after  this troop? Shall I overtake them? And [2said 3to him 1the lord], Pursue! for in overtaking you shall overtake them, and in rescuing you shall rescue.

9. And David went, he and the six hundred men with him. And they come unto the rushing stream of Besor, and the extra ones stopped.

10. And [4pursued 1about 2four hundred 3men], [4stood 1and 2two hundred 3men], who stayed on the other side of the rushing stream  Besor.

11. And they find an Egyptian man in the field, and they take him, and bring him to David, and give to him bread and he ate, and they gave [3to drink 1him 2water].

12. And they give to him a piece of dried cluster of figs, and two dried grape clusters; and he ate, and [2stood up  1his spirit] in him. For he had not eaten bread, and had not drank water, three days and three nights.

13. And [2said 3to him 1David], Who are you, and from what place are you? And [4said  3servant-lad 1the 2Egyptian], I am a servant of a man, an Amalekite; and [2left 3me  1my master] for I was unwell, today being three days.

14. And we made an attack upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the ones of the part of Judea, and to the south of Caleb; and  Ziklag we burnt in fire.

15. And [2said 3to him 1David], Will you lead me to  this troop? And he said, If you swear by an oath indeed to me according to  God to not put me to death, and not to deliver me into the hands  of my master, then I will lead you to  this troop.

16. And he led him. And behold, these were dispersed upon the face of all the land, eating and drinking, and celebrating over all the [2spoils  1great] which they took from out of the land of the Philistines, and from out of the land of Judah. 

17.  David Strikes Amalek and Returns the Captives And [2came 3upon 4them 1David], and he struck them from the morning star and until evening even of the next day. And [4was not preserved 2of 3them 1a man], but only four hundred boys who mounted upon camels and fled.

18. And David removed all which [3took 1the 2Amalekites]; and both  his wives he rescued.

19. And nothing was perished to them from small and unto great, and unto sons and daughters,  from the spoils and unto all what they took of theirs -- all the things David returned.

20. And David took all the flocks and the herds, and led them away before the spoils. And concerning those spoils it was said, These are the spoils of David.

21. And David came to the two hundred men (the ones being left behind of the troop going after David) that stayed at the rushing stream of Besor. And they came forth to meet David, and to meet the people of the one with him. And David came forward unto of the people, and he asked them the greetings for peace.

22. And [6responded 1every 5man 2pestilent 3and 4wicked] of the men  warriors  going with David. And they said that, They did not pursue with us, we shall not give to them from out of the spoils which we rescued, but [2each  4his wife 5and  6his children 1let 3take away], and let them return!

23. And David said, You shall not do [2my brothers 1thus] after the delivering up of the enemy by the lord to us, and guarded us, and the lord delivered up the troop, the one coming upon us, into our hands.

24. And who will heed [2your 3words 1these], for [2not 3inferior 4to us 1they are]; for according to the portion of the one going down to  war, so shall be the portion of the one staying by the equipment; according to the same they shall be portioned.

25. And it came to pass from  that day and forward, that it became for an order and for an ordinance  in Israel until  this day.

26. And David came to Ziklag, and he sent to the elders of Judah, and to his neighbors of the spoils, saying, Behold, a blessing to you from the spoils of the enemies of the lord;

27. to the ones in Beth-el, and to the ones in Ramoth of the south, and to the ones in Jattir,

28. and to the ones in Aroer, and to the ones in Siphmoth, and to the ones in Eshtemoa,

29. and to the ones in Rachal, and to the ones in the cities of the Jerahmeelite, and to the ones in the cities of the Kenite;

30. and to the ones in Hormah, and to the ones in Beer-ashan, and to the ones in Athach;

31. and to the ones in Hebron, and into all the places which David went there, he and  his men.  

## 1 Samuel 31

1.  Saul and His Sons Killed on Mount Gilboa And the Philistines waged war against Israel. And [4fled 1the 2men 3of Israel] from the face of the Philistines, and they fell slain in  mount Gilboa.

2. And [3joined up against 1the 2Philistines]  Saul and  his sons. And [3struck down 1the 2the Philistines]  Jonathan, and  Abinadab, and  Melchi-shua, sons of Saul.

3. And [3weighs down 1the 2battle] against Saul, and [3find 4him 1the 2shooters], men bowmen; and he was wounded in the spleen.

4. And Saul said to the one carrying  his weapons, Unsheathe  your broadsword, and pierce me with it! lest [2should come  1these uncircumcised] and should pierce me, and should mock against me. But [4did not 5want to 1the one 2carrying  3his weapons], for he feared exceedingly. And Saul took  his broadsword, and fell upon it.

5. And [4beheld 1the one 2carrying  3his weapons] that Saul died, and he fell also himself upon  his broadsword, and died with him.

6. And Saul died, and  [2three 3sons 1his], and the one carrying  his weapons, and all  his men, in  that day at the same time.

7. And [4beheld 1the 2men 3of Israel], the ones on the other side of the valley, and the ones on the other side of the Jordan, that [4fled 1the 2men 3of Israel], and that Saul died, and  his sons. And they leave  their cities, and flee. And [3come 1the 2Philistines] and dwell in them.

8. And it came to pass on the next day, and [3come 1the 2Philistines] to strip the slain, and they find  Saul and  [2three 3sons 1his] fallen upon the mountains of Gilboa.

9. And they behead him, and they strip him  of his weapons, and they send into the land of the Philistines round about, announcing good news to their idols, and to their people.

10. And they presented  his weapons in the Astartion. And  his body they fastened down on the wall in Beth-shan.

11. And [5hear 6concerning 1the ones 2dwelling 3in Jabish  4Gilead] as much as [3did 1the 2Philistines]  to Saul.

12. And [5rose up 1all 2the 3men 4of power]. And they went the entire  night, and took the body of Saul, and the body of Jonathan  his son from the wall in Beth-sham. And they brought them into Jabish, and incinerated them there.

13. And they took  their bones and they entombed them by the plowed field, the one in Jabish, and they fasted seven days.
