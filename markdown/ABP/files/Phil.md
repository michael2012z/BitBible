# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1.  Paul's Greeting Paul and Timothy, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the holy ones in Christ Jesus, to the ones being in Philippi, with the overseers and servants.

2. Favor to you and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I give thanks to my God for [4all 1the 2memory 3of you],

4. at all times in every supplication of mine for all of you, [3with 4joy  2supplication 1making],

5. for  your fellowship in the good news from the first day until the present;

6. being persuaded in this same thing, that the one commencing in you [2work 1a good], will complete it as far as the day of Jesus Christ;

7. as is just for me to think this as to you all, because of  [2having 3me 4in  5your heart 1you], both in  my bonds, and in the defense and security of the good news, [4fellow-partakers 5of my  6favor 2all 1you 3being].

8. [5witness 1For 4my 3is  2God], how I long after you all in feelings of compassion of Jesus Christ.

9. And this I pray, that the love of yours still more and more should abound in full knowledge, and in all perception,

10. for  you to approve the things differing, that you might be honest and without cause to stumble in the day of Christ,

11. being filled with fruits of righteousness, of the ones by Jesus Christ, to glory and praise of God. 

12.  Paul's Motives [4to know 1But 3you 2I want], brethren, that the things concerning me rather in progression of the good news have come,

13. so as  my bonds [2apparent 3in 4Christ 1to become] in the whole  praetorium, and to all the rest;

14. and the more of the brethren [2in 3the Lord 1relying],  [3in my bonds 2more exceedingly 1dare] [4fearlessly 2the 3word 1to speak].

15. Some indeed also through envy and strife; but some also through good-pleasure [2the 3Christ 1proclaim].

16. The ones indeed from out of contention [2the 3Christ 1announce], not purely, imagining [2affliction 1to add] to my bonds.

17. But the ones from out of love, knowing that for a defense of the good news I am situated.

18. For what? Only in every manner, whether an excuse, whether truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, but, also I will rejoice.

19. For I know that this to me shall result in deliverance through  your supplication, and the supplying of the spirit of Jesus Christ;

20. according to  [2earnest expectation 3and 4hope 1my], that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in every open manner, as at all times, and now [2shall be magnified 1Christ] in  my body, whether through life, whether through death.

21. For to me  to live is Christ, and  to die gain.

22. But if  to live in flesh, this to me is fruit of work; and what I shall take up I know not.

23. But I am constrained by the two, [2the 3desire 1having] for  disengaging, and [2with 3Christ 1to be 5much 4is rather] better;

24.  but to remain in the flesh is more important for you.

25. And this being persuaded of, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all in  your progression and joy of the belief;

26. that  your boasting should abound in Christ Jesus in me through  my arrival again with you.

27. Only [2worthily 3of the 4good news 5of the 6Christ 1conduct yourselves in public]! that whether having come and having seen you, or whether being absent, I should hear the things concerning you, that you stand firmly in one spirit, one soul, fighting together in the belief of the good news;

28. and not being terrified in anything by the ones being an adversary, which to them indeed is a demonstration of destruction, but to you deliverance -- and this from God.

29. For to you it was granted  concerning Christ, not only the [2in 3him 1trusting], but also the [2for 3him 1suffering],

30. [2the 3same 4struggle 1having] as you saw in me, and now hear of by me.  

## Philippians 2

1.  Be of One Mind If then there be any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any feelings of compassion and pities,

2. fulfill my  joy! that [2the 3same 1you should be thinking], [2the 3same 4love 1having], unanimous,  [2one thing 1thinking];

3. nothing according to contention or self seeking-glory; but  in humility, [2one another 1esteeming] superior than oneselves.

4. [2not 5for the things 6of themselves 3each 1Let 4watch out], but [2also 3the things 4of others 1each]!

5. [3this 1For 2let 4thinking] be in you which also is in Christ Jesus!

6. who [2in 3the appearance 4of God 1existing], [2not 3a seizure 1esteemed it]  to be equal with God;

7. but emptied himself, [2the appearance 3of a bondman 1having taken on], [2in 3the likeness 4of men 1having become].

8. And in condition having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become subject unto death, even death of the cross.

9. Therefore also  God greatly exalted him, and granted to him the name  above every name,

10. that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend -- heavenly, and earthly, and underground;

11. and every tongue should acknowledge that [3is Lord 1Jesus 2Christ] to the glory of God the father.

12. So that, my beloved, as at all times you obeyed, not as at  my arrival only, but now much rather in  my absence, with fear and trembling  [2your own 3deliverance 1work out]!

13.  For God is the one operating in you both  to want and  to operate for the good-pleasure.

14. Do all things without grumblings and arguings!

15. that you should become blameless and unmixed, children of God, without blemish, in the midst of a generation crooked and perverted, among whom you appear as luminaries in the world,

16. [2the word 3of life 1giving heed to], for a boasting to me in the day of Christ, that not in vain I ran, nor in vain I tired.

17. But even if I am offered as a libation upon the sacrifice and ministration of the belief of yours, I rejoice, and I rejoice along with all you.

18. And likewise also you rejoice, even rejoice along with me! 

19.  Paul and Timothy But I hope in the Lord Jesus [2Timothy 3quickly 1to send forth] to you, that I also should be full of confidence, having known the things concerning you.

20. [3no one 1For 2I have] like-minded who genuinely [2the things 3concerning 4you 1shall have concern for],

21.  ([2all 1for 4the things 5of themselves 3seek], not the things  of Christ Jesus.)

22. but the proof of him you know, that as to a father [2as a child 3with 4me 1he served] in the good news.

23. This one indeed then I hope to send forth (as whenever I look over the things concerning me) immediately.

24. And I am persuaded in the Lord, that also myself [2quickly 1shall come].

25. [3important 1But 2I esteemed it] that Epaphroditus the brother and fellow-worker and my fellow-soldier, (but your apostle,) and minister  of my need to send to you,

26. since he was longing after you all, and was anxious because you heard that he was sick.

27. For even he was sick, close to death; but  God showed mercy on him; [2not 3him 1and] only, but also me, that [2not 4distress 5upon 6distress 1I should 3have].

28. More diligently then I sent him, that seeing him again, you should rejoice, and I should be free from sorrow.

29. Favorably receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and  such ones [2in esteem 1have]!

30. for because of the work of the Christ [2unto 3death 1he approached], risking  his life, that he should supply  your deficiency of the [2towards 3me 1ministration].  

## Philippians 3

1.  Warning to Believers To the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord! The same things to write to you, to me indeed is not laziness, but for you safe.

2. Take heed of the dogs! Take heed of the evil workers! Take heed to the circumcisers!

3. For we are the circumcision, the ones [2in spirit 3of God 1serving], and boasting in Christ Jesus, and not [2in 3flesh 1relying];

4. though I have reliance even in flesh. If any [2thinks 1other] to rely in flesh, I more.

5. As to circumcision -- on the eight day; of the race -- of Israel; as to tribe -- Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; according to law -- a Pharisee;

6. according to zeal -- persecuting the assembly; according to righteousness, the one in the law -- having become blameless.

7. But what was to me gain, these I esteemed [2through 3the 4Christ 1loss].

8. But certainly also I esteem all things to be loss on account of the superiority of the knowledge of Christ Jesus  my Lord, through whom all things I suffered loss, and esteem them to be dung, that [2Christ 1I should gain],

9. and I should be found in him not having my righteousness, that is of the law, but the one through belief of Christ, the [2of 3God 1righteousness] unto the belief;

10.  to know him, and the power  of his resurrection, and the fellowship  of his sufferings, being conformable to his death;

11. if by any means I should arrive at the resurrection of the dead.

12. Not that already I received, or already I have been perfected; but I pursue, if even I should overtake upon which also I was overtaken by the Christ -- Jesus.

13. Brethren, I myself consider not to have overtaken; but in [3the things 2indeed 4behind 1forgetting], but the things in front stretching out farther,

14. towards the aim I pursue unto the victory prize of the upward calling  of God in Christ Jesus.

15. As many as then are complete, should think this; and if any [2differently 1think], also this  God will reveal to you.

16. Besides, in what we attained, by the same [2we are to conform 1rule 4the 5same 3to think]. 

17.  Become Imitators [2imitators together 3of me 1Become], brethren, and watch the ones thus walking! as you have us for a model.

18. For many walk whom often I told you, and now even weeping I tell -- the enemies of the cross  of Christ;

19. whose  end is destruction, whose  god is the belly, and the glory is in  their shame, the ones  [2earthly things 1thinking].

20. For of us the citizenship in the heavens exists, of which also [2a deliverer 1we await] -- the Lord Jesus Christ,

21. who will change [3appearance 1the 2body]  of our humiliation, for  its becoming conformable to the body  of his glory, according to the operation  of his being able, and to subject to himself the whole.  

## Philippians 4

1.  Stand Firm in The Lord So that, [5brethren 1my 2beloved 3and 4longed for], [2joy 3and 4crown 1my], so stand firm in the Lord, beloved!

2. Euodia I appeal to, and Syntyche I appeal to, [2the 3same 1to think] in the Lord.

3. Yes, I ask also you [2fellow-companion 1genuine], aid these women! who in the good news fought together with me; also with Clement, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose  names are in the book of life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord at all times, again I say, Rejoice!

5.  [2your leniency 1Let] be known to all men! The lord is near.

6. Let no one be anxious, but in all  prayer and  supplication with thankfulness  [2your requests 1let] be made known to  God!

7. And the peace  of God, the one surpassing every mind, shall guard  your hearts and  your thoughts in Christ Jesus. 

8.  Consider These Virtues For the rest, brethren, as much as is true, as much as is serious, as much as is just, as much as is pure, as much as is friendly, as much as is of good report, if any virtue and if any high praise, these things consider!

9. What also you learned and received, and heard, and saw in me, these things practice! and the God  of peace will be with you.

10. And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that already at some time you flourished again  [2about 3me 1to think]; upon which also you thought, but lacked means.

11. Not that, [2as to 3deficiency 1I speak]; for I learned in what I am to be self-sufficient.

12. I know also to be humble, I know also to abound. In everything, and in all things I am initiated, both to be full and to hunger, and to abound and to be lacking.

13. I am strong for all things in the one empowering me -- Christ.

14. Besides [2well 1you did] partaking together with my  affliction.

15. And know also you, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I came forth from Macedonia, not one [3me 1assembly 2participated with] in the matter of portioning out and receiving, except you alone.

16. For also in Thessalonica even once and twice [2for  3my need 1you sent forth].

17. Not that I anxiously seek the gift, but I anxiously seek the fruit  being superabundant for your account.

18. But I receive all things, and I abound. I am full, having received by Epaphroditus the things from you, a scent of pleasant aroma, a sacrifice accepted, well-pleasing  to God. 

19.  God will Fill all your Need  And my God will fill all your need, according to  his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

20. But to the God and father of us be the glory into the eons of the eons. Amen.

21. Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus! [5greet 6you 1The 3with 4me 2brethren].

22. [4greet 5you 1All 2the 3holy ones], and especially the ones of the house of Caesar.

23. The favor  of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
