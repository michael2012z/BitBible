# 1 Thessalonians

## 1 Thessalonians 1

1.  Paul's Greetings to the Thessalonians Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, to the assembly of Thessalonians, in God the father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Favor to you, and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

2. We give thanks to God at all times concerning all of you, [2mention 3of you 1making] in  our prayers;

3. continually remembering your  work of the belief, and the toil of the love, and the endurance of the hope  of our Lord Jesus Christ, before  [2God 3and 4father 1our].

4. Knowing brethren, O ones being loved by God,  of your selection,

5. that  our good news did not take place in you in word only, but also in power, and in [2spirit 1holy], and in [2full assurance 1much]; as you know what we became among you for you.

6. And you [2imitators 3of us 1became], and of the Lord, having received the word in [2affliction 1much], with joy [2spirit 1of holy],

7. so that you became models to all the ones believing in  Macedonia and  Achaia.

8. [2from 3you 1For 8has resounded 4the 5word 6of the 7Lord], not only in  Macedonia but in Achaia. But also in every place the belief of yours, the one towards  God, has gone forth, so as [3no 4need 1for us 2to have] to say anything.

9. For they themselves [2concerning 3us 1report] as to like what introduction we had towards you, and how you turned to  God from the idols, to serve [4God 1a living 2and 3true],

10. and to await  his son from out of the heavens, whom he raised from the dead -- Jesus, the one rescuing us from the [2wrath  1coming].  

## 1 Thessalonians 2

1.  Paul's Motives For you yourselves know, brethren,  our introduction, the one towards you, that [2not 4in vain 1it has 3been];

2. but also having suffered before, and having been insulted, as you know, in Philippi, we were speaking openly in  our God, to speak to you the good news  of God with much struggle.

3.  For our exhortation was not from out of delusion, nor from out of uncleanness, nor in deceit.

4. But as having been tried by  God to be trusted with the good news, so we speak; not as [2men 1pleasing], but to God, to the one trying  our hearts.

5. For neither at any time with word of flattery did we exist, as you know, nor with an excuse for a desire for wealth, (God is witness),

6. nor seeking [2from 3men 1glory], nor from you, nor from others; though being able in weight to be as Christ's apostles.

7. But we became calm in your midst, as even a nurse should comfort her own children.

8. Thus longing over you, we thought well to share with you not only the good news  of God, but also  our own lives, because [2beloved 3to us 1you have become].

9. For you remember, brethren,  our toil and the trouble, for night and day working, for the not overburdening any of you, we proclaimed to you the good news  of God.

10. You are witnesses and  God, how sacredly, and justly, and blamelessly [2to you 3the ones 4believing 1we were].

11. Just as you know, how each one of you as a father of his own children, we were comforting you and consoling,

12. and testifying, for  you to walk worthily  of God, of the one calling you into  his own kingdom and glory.

13. On account of this also we give thanks to God continually, that taking to yourselves the word of report [2by 3us  1of God], you received not the word of men, but as it is truly, the word of God, which also exerts energy in you -- the ones believing.

14. For you [2imitators 1became], brethren, of the assemblies  of God, the ones being in  Judea in Christ Jesus; that the same things [3suffered 2also 1you] by your own fellow-tribesmen, as also they by the Jews,

15. the ones both [2the 3Lord 1killing] Jesus, and their own prophets, and driving you out, and [3to God 1are not 2pleasing], and [2to all 3men 1opposing];

16. (ones restraining us [2to the 3nations 1to speak], that they should be delivered,) so as  to fill up their  sins at all times; but came upon them the wrath to the end.

17. But we, brethren, being orphaned from you for [2time 1an hour], in person, not in heart, more exceedingly hurried  [2your face 1to behold] with much desire.

18. Therefore we wanted to come to you -- even indeed I Paul, even once and twice; and [2hindered 3us  1Satan].

19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? or is it not also you in front of  our Lord Jesus Christ at  his arrival?

20. For you are  our glory and  joy.  

## 1 Thessalonians 3

1.  Timothy's Ministry to the Thessalonians Therefore no longer holding off, we thought well to be left behind in Athens alone;

2. and we sent forth Timothy  our brother and servant  of God, and our fellow-worker in the good news of the Christ, for the supporting you, and to comfort you concerning the belief of yours;

3. in the no one shrinking in  these afflictions; for you yourselves know that in this we are situated.

4. For also, when [2with 3you 1we were], we said beforehand to you that we are about to be afflicted; as also it happened, and you know.

5. Because of this, I also no longer holding off, sent forth for the knowing the belief of yours, lest perhaps [3tested 4you 1the one 2testing], and [3in 4vain 2became  1our toil].

6. But now Timothy having come to us from you, and having announced good news to us, the belief and the love of yours, and that you have [3remembrance 4of us 2a good 1at all times], longing to see us, just as also we you;

7. because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you in all  [2affliction 3and 4necessity 1our], because of the belief of yours;

8. for now we live if you stand firmly in the Lord.

9. For what thankfulness are we able  to recompense God concerning you, for all the joy which we rejoice on account of you before  our God,

10. night and day superabundantly beseeching for the beholding your  face, and to ready the deficiencies of the belief of yours?

11. [7himself 1And  4God 5and 6father 3our 8and  9our Lord 10Jesus 11Christ 2may] straighten out  our way to you.

12. [6you 1And 3the 4Lord 2may 5superabound], and may he abound the love towards one another, and towards all, just as also we towards you;

13. so as  to support your  hearts blameless in holiness before the God and our father, at the arrival  of our Lord Jesus Christ with all  his holy ones.  

## 1 Thessalonians 4

1.  An Appeal to Sanctification The rest then, brethren, we ask you and appeal in the Lord Jesus, as you received from us the thing how it was necessary for you to walk and to please God, that you should abound more.

2. For you know what exhortations we gave to you through the Lord Jesus.

3. For this is the will  of God --  your sanctification, for you to be at a distance from  harlotry.

4. [3to know 1For each 2of you]  his own vessel, to possess in sanctification and honor,

5. not in passion of desire, as even the nations, the ones not knowing  God;

6.  to not pass over and to overabound in the matter  of his brother; for the one punishing is the Lord concerning all these things, as also we foretold to you, and we testified.

7. [5not 1For 3called 4us  2God] unto uncleanness, but in sanctification.

8. Accordingly the one disregarding, [2not 3man 1disregards], but  God, the one also having given  [3spirit 1his  2holy] to us.

9. And concerning  brotherly affection [2no 3need 1you have] for me to write to you; [3yourselves 1for 2you] are taught by God   to love one another.

10. For also you do this towards all the brethren, the ones in all  Macedonia! But we appeal to you, brethren, to abound more,

11. and to strive earnestly to be quiet, and to do your own things, and to work with [2own 3hands 1your], as we exhorted to you;

12. that you should walk decently towards the ones outside, and no one [2need 1should have]. 

13.  The Arrival of The Lord [2I do not 3want 1But] you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning the ones having gone to sleep, that you do not fret as even the rest, the ones not having hope.

14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose up, so also  God [4the ones 5having gone to sleep 6through  7Jesus 1will bring 2with 3him].

15. For this to you we say by word of the Lord, that we, the ones living, the ones remaining at the arrival of the Lord, in no way should anticipate the ones having gone to sleep.

16. For [3himself 1the 2Lord] in a word of command by the voice of an archangel, and with a trumpet of God, shall descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise up first.

17. Thereupon we the living, the ones remaining, together with them shall be seized in clouds, for meeting the Lord in the air, and thus at all times with the Lord we shall be.

18. So then comfort one another by  these words!  

## 1 Thessalonians 5

1.  The Day of The Lord But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, [2no 3need 1You have 5to you 4to be written],

2. [3yourselves 1for 5exactly 2you 4know] that the day of the Lord [3as 4a thief 5in 6the night 1so 2comes].

3. For whenever they should say, Peace and safety, then sudden [2sets upon them 1ruin], as if the pangs to the one [2in 3the womb 1having one]; and in no way should they flee from it.

4. But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day [2you 3as 4a thief 1should overtake].

5. [3all 1You 4sons 5of light 2are], and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.

6. So then we should not be sleeping as also the rest; but we should be vigilant and be sober.

7. For the ones sleeping, [2night 1sleep at]; and the ones being intoxicated, [2at night 1are intoxicated].

8. But we being of day should be sober, putting on the chest plate of belief and love, and helmet -- hope of deliverance.

9. For [4not 2set 3us  1God] for wrath, but for the procurement of salvation through  our Lord Jesus Christ,

10. the one having died for us; that whether we be vigilant, or whether we sleep, together with him we shall live.

11. Therefore comfort one another, and let [2build up 1one] the other one, as even you do! 

12.  Final Exhortations And we appeal to you, brethren, to know the ones tiring in labor among you, and being set over you in the Lord, and admonishing you;

13. and to esteem them superabundantly in love on account of  their work. Make peace among yourselves!

14. And we appeal to you, brethren, admonish the ones in disorder! Console the ones being faint-hearted! Hold to the weak! Be long-suffering to all!

15. See that not anyone [3hurt 4for 5hurt 2anyone 1should recompense]! but at all times  [2good 1pursue] both towards one another and towards all!

16. At all times rejoice!

17. Continually pray!

18. In everything give thanks! for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

19. [3the 4spirit 1Do not 2extinguish]!

20. [3prophecies 1Do not 2treat] with contempt!

21. [2all things 1Prove]! [2the 3good 1Hold to]!

22. [2from 3every 4appearance 5of evil 1Be at a distance]!

23. And he, the God  of peace, may he sanctify you perfectly complete; and may your entire  spirit, and  soul, and  body, [2blamelessly 3in 4the 5arrival  6of our Lord 7Jesus 8Christ 1be kept].

24. [4is trustworthy 1The one 2calling 3you], who also will act.

25. Brethren, pray for us!

26. Greet [2the 3brethren 1all] with [2kiss 1a holy]!

27. I adjure you by the Lord, [3to be read 1for the 2letter] to all the holy brethren.

28. The favor  of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
