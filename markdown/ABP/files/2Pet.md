# 2 Peter

## 2 Peter 1

1.  Exhortation for Godly Living Simon Peter, a bondman and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the ones equally honored with us having obtained belief in righteousness  of our God and deliverer Jesus Christ.

2. Favor to you and [2peace 1may] be multiplied in full knowledge  of God and of Jesus  our Lord,

3. as all things to us  [2divine 3power 1of his], the things for life and piety, being presented through the full knowledge of the one having called us by glory and virtue,

4. by which [2the things 3esteemed 4for us 5and 6greatest 7declarations 1he has presented], that through these you should become [2divine 1partners of] nature, having escaped the [2in 3the world 4by 5lust 1corruption].

5. [3also 2for this same reason 1And], [3diligence 2all 1adding], supply in the belief of yours the virtue, and in the virtue the knowledge,

6. and in the knowledge the self-control, and in the self-control the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,

7. and in the piety the brotherly affection, and in the brotherly affection the love!

8. For these things being in you, and being superabundant, [2not 3idle 4nor 5unfruitful 1they stand] in the  [2of our Lord 3Jesus 4Christ 1full knowledge].

9. But in whom [2are not 3at hand 1these things] is blind, losing sight, [2forgetfulness 1having taken] of the cleansing  of his earlier sins.

10. Therefore rather, brethren, hurry [6firm 2your  3calling 4and 5selection 1to make]! for these things doing, in no way should you fail at some time or other.

11. For thus richly shall be supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom  of our Lord and deliverer Jesus Christ.

12. Therefore I shall not neglect [2you 3continually 1to remind] concerning these things, though knowing, and being fixed firmly in the [2at hand 1truth].

13. But justly I esteem it, for as long as I am in this  tent, to awaken you by recollection;

14. knowing that [5quick 4is 1the 2getting rid  3of my tent], as also  our Lord Jesus Christ manifested to me.

15. But I will hurry also always for you to have after  my exodus, the [3of these things 2remembrance 1making].

16. For not [2discerning 3fables 1following after] did we make known to you the  [4of our Lord 5Jesus 6Christ 1power 2and 3arrival], but [2spectators 1having been]  of that ones' magnificence.

17. For having received from God the father honor and glory, [2voice 3having been brought 4to him 1such a] by the majestic glory, saying, This is  my son the beloved, in whom I take pleasure in.

18. And this  voice we heard [2from 3heaven 1brought], [2with 3him 1being] on the [2mountain  1holy]. 

19.  The Prophetic Word And we have more firm the prophetic word; which well you do heeding, as a lamp shining forth in a dismal place, until which day should shine through, and the morning star should arise in  your hearts.

20. This first knowing, that every prophecy of scripture [3by private 4explanation 1does not 2take place].

21. For not by will of man was [2borne 3at some time or other 1prophecy], but by [2spirit 1holy] being borne [5spoke 1the 2holy 4of God 3men].  

## 2 Peter 2

1.  Concerning False Prophets and Teachers But there existed also false prophets among the people; as also among you there will be false teachers, ones who shall introduce privately [2sects 1destructive], and [2the 4buying 5them 3master 1denying], bringing unto themselves quick destruction.

2. And many shall follow after them in the destruction, through whom the way of the truth shall be blasphemed.

3. And by a desire for wealth, with shaped words, they shall make trade of you; for whom the judgment of old is not idle, and  their destruction shall not slumber.

4. For if  God [2of angels 3sinning 1spared not], but in chains of the infernal region delivered them up for [2judgment 1being kept for];

5. and the ancient world he spared not, but [3the eighth 2Noah 5of righteousness 4proclaimer 1kept], [2the flood 4world 3to the impious 1having brought];

6. and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having reduced to ashes [2by a final event 1he condemned]; [2an example 3for the ones being about 4to be impious 1having set];

7. and [2righteous 3Lot 4being harassed 5by 6the  7unlawful ones 8in 9lewdness 10of behavior, 1he rescued],

8. (for by sight and hearing, the righteous man dwelling among them, day by day [3soul 2his righteous 4by their lawless 5works 1tormented];)

9. but the Lord knows [2the pious 3from 4tests 1to rescue], and the unrighteous [2for 3a day 4of judgment 5being punished 1to keep];

10. and especially the ones [2after 3the flesh 4in 5a desire 6for defilement 1going], and [2lordship 1ones disdaining]; daring, self-willed, [4glories 1they do not 2tremble 3in blaspheming].

11. Where angels [2in strength 3and 5power 4greater 1being], do not bring against them before the Lord a blasphemous case.

12. But these, as [2illogical 3living creatures 1physical], engendered for conquest and corruption in [2what 3they know not 1blaspheming], in their corruption shall be laid waste;

13. carrying a wage of unrighteousness; [5satisfaction 1esteeming 2the 3daily 4delicacy]. Stains and blemishes, reveling in  their deceptions, feasting together with you;

14. [2eyes 1having] full of an adulterous one, and ceaseless of sin; entrapping [2souls 1unstable]; [2a heart 3being exercised 4for a desire for wealth 1having]; [2of curse 1children].

15. Leaving behind the straight way, they wandered, following after the way  of Balaam the son of Bosor, who [2the wage 3of unrighteousness 1loved];

16. [3rebuke 1but 2had] of his own unlawfulness -- [2beast 1a voiceless], in a man's voice uttering a sound, restrained the [2of the 3prophet 1ranting].

17. These are [2springs 1waterless], clouds [2by 3a tempest 1being driven], ones to whom the infernal region  of darkness [2into 3the eon 1is kept].

18. For [2pompous 4of folly 1uttering 3sounds], they entrap by the desires of the flesh, in lewdnesses, the ones who really escaped from the ones [2in 3delusion 1behaving],

19. [2freedom 3to them 1promising], they [2bondmen 1being]  of corruption; for by whom anyone has been vanquished, by this one even he is enslaved.

20. For if they having escaped the defilements of the world, in the full knowledge of the Lord and deliverer Jesus Christ, and in these things again being entangled they are vanquished, [3has become 4to them 1the 2last] worse than the first.

21. [3better 1For 2it was] for them to have not known the way  of righteousness, than having known, to have turned from the [3delivered 4to them 1holy 2commandment].

22. But has come to pass to them the word of the true proverb, A dog having returned unto its own excrement, and [2pig 1a bathed] unto wallowing in mire.  

## 2 Peter 3

1.  Regarding the Last Days This already, beloved, a second [3to you 2I write 1letter], in which I awaken your [3in 4recollection  1honest 2consideration],

2. to remember the before described sayings by the holy prophets, and of the [7the 8apostles 6of us 1commandment 2of the 3Lord 4and 5deliverer].

3. This first knowing, that [2will come 3at 4the last 5of the 6days 1mockers], [2according to  3their own 4lusts 1going],

4. and saying, Where is the promise  of his arrival? [2from 3of which time 1For] the fathers went to sleep, all things thus continue from the beginning of creation.

5. [3escaped 5notice 1For 4their 2this] willingly, that heavens were of old, and an earth from out of water and through water stood together by the  word of God;

6. through of which things the [2then 1world 5by water 4having been flooded 3perished].

7. But the present heavens and the earth, the one of his word, are treasured up for fire being kept for a day of judgment and destruction  of impious men.

8. But this one thing let it not be unaware to you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as [2day 1one].

9. [3is not 4slow 1The 2Lord]  of promise, as some [2slowness 1esteem], but is long-suffering towards us, not willing for anyone to perish, but for all [2for 3repentance 1to have space].

10. But shall come the day of the Lord as a thief in the night, in which the heavens by a loud noise shall pass away, and the elements being destroyed by fire shall be loosed; and the earth and the [2in 3it 1works] shall be incinerated.

11. These things then all being loosed, what kind of persons must you be in holy behavior and piety,

12. expecting and hastening the arrival of the  day of God, by which the heavens being set on fire shall be loosed, and the elements being destroyed by fire shall melt away?

13. But new heavens and [2earth 1a new], according to  his declaration, we expect, in which righteousness dwells.

14. Therefore, beloved, these things expecting, endeavor [3spotless 4and 5without blemish 2by him 1to be found] in peace!

15. And [2the  5of our Lord 3long-suffering 4deliverance 1esteem]; as also  our beloved brother Paul, according to the [3to him 2given 1wisdom], wrote to you,

16. as also in all the letters, speaking in them concerning these things; in which [2are 3hard to comprehend 1some things], which the illiterate and unstable make crooked, as also the rest of scriptures, to  their own destruction.

17. You then, beloved, foreknowing, guard that not by the [2of the 3unlawful ones 1delusion] having been led away, you should fall from your own steadfastness!

18. But grow in the favor and knowledge  of our Lord and deliverer Jesus Christ! To him be the glory both now and into the day of the eon. Amen.
