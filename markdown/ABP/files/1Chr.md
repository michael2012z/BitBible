19. And some from Manasseh joined with David in the coming of the Philistines against Saul for war. And [2did not 3help 4them 1David], for in counsel it came to pass from the commandants of the Philistines, saying, With  our heads he will return to his master Saul.

3. And we should turn the ark  of our God to us, for [3not 1we sought 2it] from the days of Saul.

4. And [4said 1all 2the 3assembly]  to do so, for [3was upright 1the 2word] in the eyes of all the people.

5. And David assembled  all Israel, from the borders of Egypt and unto the entrance of Hamath,  to carry in the ark  of God from the city of Jearim.

10. And the lord was enraged in anger against Uzza, and he struck him there, on account of the stretching out  of his hand upon the ark. And he died there before  God.

11. And David was depressed, that the lord cut a severance with Uzza. And he called  that place -- Severance of Oza until  this day.

12. And David feared  God in  that day, saying, How shall I carry in to myself the ark  of God?

13. And [2did not 3return 1David] the ark to himself into the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Obed Edom the Gittite.

14. And [4stayed 1the 2ark  3of God] in the household of Obed Edom in  his house [2months 1three]. And the lord blessed the house of Obed Edom, and all  of his.

10. And David asked through  God, saying, Shall I ascend against the Philistines? and will you give them into  my hands? And [2said 3to him 1the lord], Ascend! and I will give them into  your hands.

11. And he ascended into Baal Perazim. And [2struck 3them 1David] there. And David said, God cut through  my enemies by my hand as a severance of water. On account of this he called the name  of that place -- Severance of Baal Perazim.

12. And [3abandoned 4there 1the 2Philistines]  their gods. And David spoke, and they were set on fire with fire.

13. And [3proceeded 4yet again 1the 2Philistines], and assembled for battle again in the valley of the giants.

14. And David asked again to God. And [2said 3to him  1God], Do not go after them! turn from them, and come to them near the pear trees!

15. And it will be in  your hearing the sound of the rumbling of them in the tips of the pear trees, then you shall enter into the battle, for [2went forth  1God] before you  to strike the camp of the Philistines.

16. And David did as [2gave charge 3to him  1God]. And he struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon unto Gezer.

1.  David Prohibited from Building God's House And it came to pass as David dwelt in  his house, and David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of the covenant of the lord is underneath hide coverings.

2. And Nathan said to David, All  in  your soul do! for  God is with you.

3. And it came to pass in  that night, and [3came 1the word 2of God] to  Nathan,

4. You go, and say to David  my servant! Thus said the lord, You shall not build for me a house  for me to dwell in it.

5. for I did not dwell in a house from the day which I led up  Israel until  this day; for I was in a tent for protection and inside the covering.

6. In all the places in which I went with all Israel, did in speaking I say to any one tribe of Israel, to the ones whom I gave charge  to tend  my people, saying, Why did you not build for me a house of cedar?

7. And now, thus you shall say to my servant David, Thus says the lord of the forces, I took you from out of the haven, from following the flocks,  to be as one leading over  my people Israel.

8. And I was with you in all the places in which you went, and I utterly destroyed all  your enemies from in front of you, and I made to you a name according to the name of the great ones, of the ones upon the earth.

9. And I shall establish a place  for my people Israel, and I will plant him, and he shall encamp by himself, and he shall not be disturbed any longer; and [3shall not 4proceed 1the son 2of iniquity]  to humble him as from the beginning.

10. And from days which I arranged judges over  my people Israel, and I humbled all  your enemies, even I will increase you, and I will build to you a house, says the lord.

11. And it will be whenever [2should be filled  1your days]  to go with  your fathers, that I will raise up  your seed after you, who will be from  your belly, and I will prepare  his kingdom.

12. He shall build for me a house, and I shall re-erect  his throne unto the eon.

13. I will be to him as father, and he will be to me as son. And  my mercy I will not remove from him, as I removed from the ones before you.

14. And I will stand him in  my house, and with  his kingdom unto the eon. And  his throne will be re-erected unto the eon.

15. According to all  these words, and according to all  this vision, so spoke Nathan to David.

16. And [3came  1king 2David] and sat before the lord, and said, Who am I, O lord  God, and what  is my house, that you loved me unto the eon?

17. And these things were diminished before you,  O God; and you spoke about the house  of your servant from a long time, and looked upon me as [2vision 1man's], and raised me up high, O lord  God.

18. How shall [2proceed 3yet 1David] to you, to glorify you --  your servant? and you  [2your servant 1know].

19. O lord, on account of  your servant, and according to  your heart, you did  all this greatness, to make known all the great things.

20. O lord, there is none likened to you, and there is no God besides you, according to all as much as we heard with  our ears.

21. And there is no [2as  3your people 4Israel 1nation] yet upon the earth, as [2guided 3him  1God] for the ransoming a people to himself,  to establish to himself [4name 1a great 2and 3apparent],  to cast out [2from 3in front  4of your people 5of whom 6you ransomed 7out of 8Egypt 1nations].

22. And you appointed  your people Israel for yourself -- a people unto the eon. And you, O lord, became to them for God.

23. And now, O lord,  your word which you spoke to  your servant, and concerning  his house, let it be trusted unto the eon, and you do as you spoke!

24. And let [2be trusted 3and 4be magnified  1your name] unto the eon! saying, The lord almighty, the God of Israel, God to Israel; and the house of David  your servant being erected before you.

25. For you, O lord  my God, uncovered the ear  of your servant,  to build him a house. Because of this [2found need  1your servant]  to pray before your face.

26. And now, O lord, You are he --  God, and you spoke [2concerning  3your servant  1these good things].

27. And now you began  to bless the house  of your servant,  for it to be in the eon before you. For you, O lord, blessed; and it is blessed into the eon.

## 1 Chronicles 19

1.  David's Servants Disgraced by Hanun And it came to pass after these things, that [5died 1Nahash 2king 3of the sons 4of Ammon], and [3reigned 1Hanun 2his son] instead of him.

2. And David said, I will do an act of kindness with Hanun son of Nahash, as [2performed  1his father 4with 5me 3kindness]. And David sent messengers  to comfort him because of  his father. And [4came 1the 2servants 3of David] into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun,  to comfort him.

3. And said the rulers of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, Is David glorifying  your father in your eyes, to send to you comforters? Is it not that they may search out the city, and  to spy out the land [2came  1his servants] to you?

4. And Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved them, and removed  their uniforms  half way unto the wrapping. And he sent them away.

5. And others came, and they reported  to David for the men. And he sent to meet them, for [3were 1the 2men] disgraced exceedingly. And [3said 1the 2king], Stay in Jericho until  [2rise up  1your beards], and return! 

6.  Syria Wages War with David And [4knew 1the 2sons 3of Ammon] that [4were put to shame 1the 2people 3of David]. And [5sent 1Hanun 2and 3the sons 4of Ammon] a thousand talents of silver  to hire for themselves of Syria of Mesopotamia, and from Syria of Maachah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen.

7. And they hired for themselves two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and  his people. And they came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from out of  their cities, and they came to  wage war.

8. And David heard, and he sent  Joab, and all the military of the forces.

9. And [4went forth 1the 2sons 3of Ammon], and deployed for war by the gatehouse of the city. And the kings, the ones coming, camped by themselves in the plain.

10. And Joab beheld that it happened in their facing off  to wage war before him from in front and from behind, that he chose of every young man of Israel, and he deployed before  Syria.

11. And the rest of the people he put into the hand of Abishai  his brother, and they deployed right opposite the sons of Ammon.

12. And he said, If Syria should strengthen over me, then you will be to me for deliverance; and if the sons of Ammon should strengthen over you, then I will deliver you.

13. Be manly! and we shall grow in strength for  our people, and for the cities  of our God; and the lord  [2good 3in 4his eyes 1shall do].

14. And Joab deployed and the people  with him right opposite Syria for war; and they fled from them.

15. And the sons of Ammon beheld that [3fled 1the 2Syrians], and they fled even themselves from in front of Abishai, and from in front of Joab  his brother. And they came into the city. And Joab went to Jerusalem.

16. And [3saw 1the 2Syrian] that [2put him to flight 1Israel], and he sent messengers, and they brought the Syrian from the other side of the river. And Shophach the commander-in-chief of the force of Hadarezer was in front of them.

17. And it was reported  to David. And he gathered together  all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and came unto them, and deployed against them. And Syria deployed right opposite David for war, and they waged war with him.

18. And Syria fled from in front of Israel. And David killed of the Syrian seven thousand of the chariots, and forty thousand men on foot; and  Shophach the commander-in-chief of the force he killed.

19. And [4beheld 1the 2servants 3of Hadarezer] that they failed from in front of Israel, and they ordained with David a peace, and they served him. And [2wanted not  1Syria]  to help the sons of Ammon any longer.  

## 1 Chronicles 20

1.  David Strikes Ammon and the Philistines And it came to pass in the [2going out 1year], in the exiting of the kings for war, that Joab led all the force of the military, and ruined the place of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged  Rabbah. And David settled in Jerusalem. And Joab struck  Rabbah, and razed it.

2. And David took the crown  of their king from  his head, and found the weight of it to be a talent of gold. And on it [2stone 1a valuable], and it was upon the head of David. And  [4spoils 5from the 6city 1he brought forth 3much 2exceedingly].

3. And the people  in it he led out, and he sawed through with saws, and with adz of iron, and with threshing machines. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David returned and all  his people unto Jerusalem.

4. And it came to pass after these things, that there was still war in Gezer with the Philistines. Then [4struck 1Sibbechai 2the 3Hushathite]  Sippai of the sons of the giants, and abased him.

5. And came to pass yet again war with the Philistines. And [4struck 1Elhanan 2son 3of Jair]  Lahmi brother of Goliath the Gittite; and the wood of his spear was as the beam of a loom of one weaving.

6. And came to pass yet again a war in Gath, and there was [2man 1an immense], and  his fingers and toes were six by six -- twenty and four; and this one was a descendant of the giants.

7. And he berated  Israel, and [6struck 7him 1Jonathan 2the son 3of Shimea 4brother 5of David].

8. These were born to Rapha in Gath; all four were giants, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.  

## 1 Chronicles 21

1.  David Numbers Israel And [2rose up 1Satan] against Israel, and stirred up  David  to count  Israel.

2. And [3said  1king 2David] to Joab, and to the rulers of the force, Go, count  Israel from Beer-sheba unto Dan, and bring it to me! and I shall know  their number.

3. And Joab said, May the lord add unto  his people as they are a hundred foldly, and the eyes  of my master the king seeing it. Are not, O my master, O king, all [3to 4my master 1for 2bondservants]? And why does [2want 3this  1my master]? so as to not become for a trespass to Israel.

4. But the saying of the king prevailed over Joab. And Joab went forth, and went unto all Israel, and went up unto Jerusalem.

5. And Joab gave the number of the numbering of the people  to David. And [3was 1all 2Israel] a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men unsheathing the broadsword. And of Judah -- four hundred and seventy thousand men unsheathing the broadsword.

6. And  Levi and  Benjamin were not counted in the midst of them, for [5was disgraceful 1the 2word 3of the 4king] to Joab.

7. And it was wicked before  God concerning  this thing, and he struck  Israel.

8. And David said to  God, I have sinned exceedingly, that I did  this thing. And now, remove indeed the iniquity  of your servant! for I acted in folly exceedingly.

9. And the lord spoke to Gad,  David's seer, saying,

10. Go and speak to David! saying, Thus says the lord, Three things I will take up upon you; choose for yourself one of them! and I will do it unto you.

11. And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says the lord, Choose for yourself!

12. Either three years of famine; or three months fleeing  from the face  of your enemies, with the sword of your enemies pursuing you; or three days of the broadsword of the lord, and plague in the land, and the angel of the lord utterly destroying among all the inheritance of Israel. And now, behold, what [2should I answer 3to the one 4sending 5me 1word]?

13. And David said to Gad, It is narrow  exceedingly, I shall fall indeed into the hands of the lord, for [3great  1his compassions 2are exceedingly]; but into the hands of men in no way should I fall. 

14.  The LORD Appoints Death in Israel And the lord appointed plague in Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

15. And God sent an angel into Jerusalem  to utterly destroy it. And as he was utterly destroying, the lord beheld and repented concerning the evil. And he said to the angel, to the one utterly destroying, Let it be enough to you, spare  your hand! And the angel of the lord stood at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

16. And David lifted up  his eyes, and he beheld the angel of the lord standing between the earth and between the heaven, and  his broadsword being unsheathed in  his hand, being stretched out over Jerusalem. And [7fell 1David 2and 3the 4elders 5wearing 6sackcloths] upon their face.

17. And David said to  God, Did I not say  to count among the people? Then I am the one sinning -- in doing evil I did evil. And these  sheep, what did they do, O lord  God? Let [2come  1your hand] against me, and against the house  of my father, and not against  your people for destruction!

18. And the angel of the lord told  Gad  to say to David that he should ascend  to establish an altar to the lord at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

19. And David ascended according to the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the lord.

20. And Ornan turned, and he beheld the king. And [2four 3sons 1his] with him were being hidden. And Ornan was threshing wheat.

21. And David came to Ornan, and Ornan came forth from the threshing-floor. And Ornan looked up, and he saw  David, and he did obeisance to  David with the face upon the ground.

22. And David said to Ornan, Give to me the place of the threshing-floor! for I shall build upon it an altar to the lord. [3for 4its money's 5worth 1Give 2it to me]! and [3shall cease 1the 2calamity] from among the people.

23. And Ornan said to David, Take it for yourself, and let [4do  1my master 2the 3king] what is good before him! Behold, I have given the oxen for a whole burnt-offering, and the plow for wood, and the grain for a sacrifice -- the whole I have given.

24. And [3said  1king 2David]  to Ornan, Not so, but only by buying shall I buy of its money's worth; for in no way shall I take the things of yours to the lord,  to offer a whole burnt-offering without charge to me to the lord.

25. And David gave to Ornan for  his place [2shekels 3of gold 4in scale-weight 1six hundred].

26. And [2built 3there 1David] an altar to the lord. And he offered whole burnt-offerings, and a deliverance offering, and he yelled to the lord. And he heeded him by fire from out of the heaven on the altar of the whole burnt-offering.

27. And the lord spoke to the angel; and he put away  his broadsword into  its sheath.

28. In  that time when  David beheld that [2heeded 3him 1the lord] at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. And the tent of the lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the whole burnt-offerings, in  that time were in Bama in Gibeon.

30. And [2was not 3able 1David]  to go before it to seek  God, for he hastened from the face of the broadsword of the angel of the lord.  

## 1 Chronicles 22

1.  David Charges Solomon to Build The LORD's House And David said, This is the house of the lord  God, and this is the altar for the whole burnt-offering to Israel.

2. And David said  to gather together all the foreigners in the land of Israel. And he placed quarriers to quarry [2stones 1planed]  to build a house to the lord.

3. And [2iron 1much] for the nails of the doorways, and of the gates, and of the hinges, David prepared; and brass in multitude -- there was no counting its weight.

4. And [3for the wood 4of cedars 1there was no 2number]; for [6brought 1the 2Sidonians 3and 4the 5Tyrians] wood of cedars in multitude to David.

5. And David said, Solomon  my son [2boy 1is a tender], and the house  to be built to the lord  must be to magnify upward, for a name and for glory in all the earth. I shall prepare for it. And David prepared for it in multitude before  his decease.

6. And he called Solomon  his son, and gave charge to him  to build the house to the lord God of Israel.

7. And David said, Solomon, My child, it was upon my soul  to build a house to the name of the lord  my God.

8. And [3came 4unto 5me 1the word 2of the lord], saying, [2blood 3in 4multitude 1You poured out], and [3wars 2great 1you made]; you shall not build a house to my name, for [3blood 2much 1you poured out] upon the earth before me.

9. Behold, a son is born to you, this one will be a man of rest; and I will rest him from all  his enemies round about. For Solomon is his name, and peace and rest I shall appoint over Israel in  his days.

10. This one shall build a house to my name, and this one shall be to me as a son, and I will be to him for father, and I will prepare the throne  of his kingdom in Israel unto the eon.

11. And now, O my son, may [2be 3with 4you 1the lord]; and you shall prosper, and shall build a house to the lord  your God, as he said concerning you.

12. Only may [2give 3to you 1the lord] wisdom and understanding, and strengthen you over Israel,  to guard and  to observe the law of the lord  your God.

13. Then the way shall prosper, if you should guard  to observe the orders and the judgments which the lord gave charge to Moses for  Israel. Be manly and be strong! Fear not nor be timid!

14. And behold, I according to  my poorness prepared for the house of the lord -- gold [3talents 1of a hundred 2thousand], and silver [3of talents 1of a thousand 2thousand], and brass, and iron of which there is no counting the weight, for [2in 3multitude 1it is]. And wood and stones I prepared. And you add unto these things!

15. And with you 3in 4multitude 1doing 2 the works] are craftsmen, quarriers of stones, and fabricators of wood, and every wise one for every work;

16. in gold and silver, in brass and in iron in which there is no number. Rise up and act and the lord be with you!

17. And David gave charge to all the rulers of Israel to assist  Solomon his son, saying,

18. Is not the lord with you? And he will give you rest round about, for he delivered up into my hand the ones dwelling the land, and [3is submitted 1the 2land] before the lord, and before his people.

19. Now give  your hearts and  your souls  to seek the lord  your God! And arise and build the sanctuary to the lord, to your God!  to carry in the ark of the covenant of the lord, and  [3items 1the 2holy]  of God, into the house  being built to the name of the lord.  

## 1 Chronicles 23

1.  Genealogy and Ministration of the Levites And David was older and full of days. And [3took reign 1Solomon  2his son] instead of him over Israel.

2. And he brought together all the rulers of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites.

3. And [3were counted 1the 2Levites] from thirty years old and up. And [4was 1the 2number 3of them] according to their head count of males -- thirty and eight thousand.

13. The sons of Amram -- Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was separated  to sanctify the holy of holies, he and his sons unto the eon,  to burn incense before the lord,  to officiate to him, and to invoke upon  his name unto the eon.

25. For David said, [4rested 1The lord  2God 3of Israel]  his people, and encamped in Jerusalem unto the eon.

26. And also to the Levites it is not to lift the tent, nor any  of its items for  its ministration.

27. For in the [2words 3of David  1last] was the number of the sons of Levi from twenty years and up.

28. For he established them for the hand of the sons of Aaron,  to officiate in the house of the lord, over the courtyards, and over the cubicles, and over the cleansing of all the holy things, and over the works of the ministration of the house of God;

29. and for the bread loaves of the place setting, and for the fine flour of the sacrifice offering, and for the [2cakes  1unleavened], and for the frying pan, and for the mixture, and for every measure;

It came to me in heart to build a house for a rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord, and a station to be the footstool of the feet  of God. And I prepared the things [2for 3the 4construction 1needful].

3. And  God said, You shall not build to me a house  to name  my name upon it, for [2a man 3of war 1you are], and [2blood 1you poured out].

4. And [4chose 1the lord  2God 3of Israel] by me from out of all the house  of my father to be king over Israel into the eon, and for Judah to take up the crown; and of the house of Judah, the house  of my father. And among the sons  of my father, in me he wanted  me to become king over all  Israel.

6. And [2said 3to me  1God], Solomon  your son shall build  my house, and  my courtyards; for I chose in him to be to me for a son, and I will be to him for a father.

For [3of all 4hearts 2inquires diligently 1the lord], and every idea of thoughts he knows. If you should seek him, he will be found by you.

12. From you are the riches and the glory. You rule all, O lord,  ruler of all sovereignty. And in  your hand is strength and dominion; and in your hand to magnify, and to strengthen  all.

13. And now, O lord, we make acknowledgment to you, and we praise the name  of your glory.

14. And who am I, and what is  my people, that we were strong  to volunteer to you thus? For [2are yours  1all things], and of your things we give to you.

15. For we are sojourners before you, and sojourners as all  our fathers, and [2are as 3shadows  1our days] upon the earth, and there is no waiting.

16. O lord  our God, to all  this abundance which we prepared for you  to build a house to your name -- to the holy name, [3from 4your hand 1for 2it is], and [3yours 2are  1all things].

17. And I know, O lord, that you are the one examining hearts, and loving righteousness. And I in singleness of heart volunteered all these things. And now,  your people,  being found here, see with gladness, volunteering to you.

18. O lord,  God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, of the one of our fathers, keep of them the thing shaped of the thoughts of the heart of your people into the eon! and straighten out  their hearts to you!

19. And [4Solomon 2to 3my son 1give 6heart 5a good]!  to observe  your commandments, and  your testimonies, and  your orders, and  [3unto 4completion 1to lead 2all], and  to build the furnishing  of your house which I prepared.
