## Psalms 1

1.  Blessed is a Man Blessed is a man who went not in counsel of impious ones, and [2in 3the way 4of sinners 1stood not], and [2upon 3a chair 4of mischievous ones 1sat not].

2. But [2is in 3the 4law 5of the lord  1his will]; and in  his law he shall meditate day and night.

3. And he will be as the tree  being planted by the outlet of the waters, which  [2his fruit 1gives] in his season, and  his leaf shall not drop down; and all as much as he should do will greatly prosper.

4. Not so the impious, not so; but is as dust which [3casts forth 1the 2wind] from the face of the earth.

5. On account of this [3shall not 4rise up 1the 2impious] in judgment, nor the sinners in the counsel of the just.

6. For the lord knows the way of the just, but the way of impious ones shall perish.  

## Psalms 2

1.  Nations Gather against The LORD A psalm to David.  Why did [2neigh 1nations], and peoples meditate upon vain things?

2. [5stood by 1The 2kings 3of the 4earth], and the rulers gathered together against the lord and against  his anointed one,

3. We should tear up  their bonds, and we should throw away from us  their yoke.

4. The one dwelling in heavens derides them, and the lord ridicules them.

5. Then he shall speak to them in his anger; and in  his rage he will disturb them.

6. But I was placed king by him over mount Zion,  his holy place;

7. declaring the order of the lord. The lord said to me, [2my son 1you are], I today engendered you.

8. Ask from me! and I will give to you nations  for your inheritance; and  for your possession the ends of the earth.

9. You shall tend them with a rod of iron; as vessels of a potter you shall break them.

10. And now, O kings, perceive! Let [6be instructed 1all 2the ones 3judging 4the 5earth]!

11. Serve to the lord in fear, and exult to him with trembling!

12. Grab instruction! lest at any time you should provoke the lord to anger, and you shall perish from [2way 1the just], whenever [2should be kindled  3quickly  1his rage]. Blessed are all the ones yielding upon him.  

## Psalms 3

1.  The LORD is Our Protector A psalm to David when he ran away from the face of Absalom  his son.  O lord, why were [4multiplied 1the ones 2afflicting 3me]? Many rise up against me.

2. Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance to him by  his God. PAUSE.

3. But you, O lord, [2my shielder 1are], my glory, and the one raising up  my head.

4. [2my voice 3to 4the lord 1I cried out], and he heeded me from out of [2mountain 1his holy].

5. And I went to bed and slept. I woke up, for the lord shall assist me.

6. I shall not fear from ten thousands of people of the ones round about joining in attacking me.

7. Rise up, O lord! Deliver me, O my God! For you struck all the ones hating me for no cause; [2the teeth 3of sinners 1you broke].

8. [2is of the 3 lord  1Deliverance], and [2is upon  3your people  1your blessing].  

## Psalms 4

1.  Put Your Hope in The LORD For the director in hymns; a psalm to David.  In  my calling, [4heard 5me 1the 2God  3of my righteousness]; in affliction he widened me. Pity me, and hear  my prayer!

2. O sons of men, until when will you ease being heavy hearted? Why do you love folly, and you seek a lie?

3. And know! that the lord did a wonder for his sacred one. The lord shall hear me in  my crying out to him.

4. Be angry, and do not sin! What you say in  your hearts, [2upon  3your beds 1Let be vexed]! PAUSE.

5. Sacrifice a sacrifice of righteousness, and hope on the lord!

6. Many say, Who shall show to us  good things? [4was signified 5to 6us 1The 2light  3of your face], O lord.

7. You put gladness into  my heart. Of the fruit of the grain, wine and olive oil -- [2of them 1they were filled].

8. In peace [2at 3the 4same place 1I will go to bed] and sleep. For you, O lord, alone [3with 4hope 1settled 2me].  

## Psalms 5

1.  The LORD is a Shield for the Just To the director; for the one inheriting; a psalm to David.   [2my words 1Give ear to], O lord! Take notice  of my cry!

2. Take heed to the voice  of my supplication, O my king and  my God! for to you I shall pray, O lord.

3. In the morning you shall hear  my voice. In the morning I shall stand beside you, and he shall watch me.

4. For [3not 4a God 5wanting 6lawlessness 1you 2are], nor shall [2sojourn 3with you 1the one being wicked];

5. nor shall [2abide 1lawbreakers] in front  of your eyes. You detested all the ones working  lawlessness.

6. You shall destroy all the ones speaking the lie. A man of blood and deceitful the lord abhors.

7. But I, in the multitude  of your mercy shall enter into  your house. I shall do obeisance towards [2temple 1your holy] in the fear of you.

8. O lord, guide me in  your righteousness, because of  my enemies! Straighten out [2before 3you  1my way]!

9. For there is no [2in  3their mouth 1truth];  their heart is vain; [2is a tomb 3having been opened  1their throat]; with their tongues they used deceit.

10. Judge them, O God! let them fall away from  their deliberations! According to the multitude  of their impieties banish them! For they rebelled against you, O lord.

11. And may [5be glad 1all 2hoping 3upon 4you]. [2into 3the eon 1They shall exult], and you shall encamp with them; and [4shall boast 5in 6you 1the ones 2loving  3your name].

12. For you shall bless the just, O lord. As a shield of benevolence you crowned us.  

## Psalms 6

1.  The LORD Delivers from the Enemy To the director in hymns; for the eighth; a psalm to David.  O lord, you should not  [3in your rage 1reprove 2me], nor  [3in your anger 1correct 2me].

2. Show mercy on me, O lord! for I am weak. Heal me, O lord! for [2are disturbed  1my bones],

3. and  my soul is disturbed exceedingly. But you, O lord, until when?

4. Return, O lord, rescue  my soul! Deliver me because of  your mercy!

5. For there is no [3in  4death  1remembering 2you]; and in  Hades, who shall make acknowledgement to you?

6. I tired in  my moaning. I shall bathe  [2each 3night  1my bed]; with my tears  [2my strewn bed 1I shall rain].

7. [2is disturbed 3from 4rage  1My eye]. I grow old in all  my enemies.

8. Remove from me all the ones working  lawlessness! For the lord heard the sound  of my weeping.

9. The lord listened to  my supplication. The lord  [2my prayer 1favorably received].

10. May they be put to shame and may they be disturbed -- all  my enemies; may they be turned back and put to shame exceedingly, even quickly.  

## Psalms 7

1.  The LORD Rescues the Innocent A psalm to David which he sang to the lord, because of the words of Cush son of Benjamin.  O lord  my God, upon you I hope. Deliver me from all the ones pursuing me, and rescue me!

2. Lest at any time [2should be snatched away 3as by 4a lion  1my soul], while there is none being for ransoming nor delivering.

3. O lord  my God, if I did this, if there is injustice in my hands,

4. if I recompensed to the ones recompensing to me with bad things, may I fall away thus from  my enemies empty --

5. may [4pursue 1then 2the 3enemy]  my soul, and may he overtake it; and may he trample [2into 3the ground  1my life]; and  [2my glory 4in 5the dust 1may 3be encamped].

6. Rise up, O lord, in your anger! Be raised up high in the limits  of your enemies! And awaken, O lord  my God! in the order in which you gave charge.

7. And a gathering of peoples shall encircle you; and for this [2unto 3the height 1return]!

8. The lord judges peoples. Judge me, O lord, according to  my righteousness! and according to  my innocence judge for me!

9. Finish off entirely indeed the wickedness of sinners! And you shall straighten the just, examining hearts and kidneys, O God, justly.

10.  My help is from  God, the one delivering the straight in the heart.

11.  God [2judge 1is a just], and strong, and lenient, not [2anger 1bringing on]  each day.

12. If you should not turn,  [2his broadsword 1he will brighten].  His bow he stretched tight, and he prepared it;

13. And by it he prepared weapons of death;  [2his arrows 3for the ones 4for burning 1he brought to completion].

14. Behold, the wicked travails with iniquity; he conceived misery, and gave birth to lawlessness.

15. [2a pit 1He dug up], even he dug it, and he shall fall into a cesspool which he worked.

16. [2shall return  1His misery] unto his own head; and [3upon 4his head  1his injustice 2shall come down].

17. I shall make acknowledgment to the lord according to  his righteousness; and I shall strum to the name of the lord the highest.  

## Psalms 8

1.  The LORD is Wonderful To the director; for the wine vats; a psalm to David.  O lord,  our Lord, how wonderful  is your name in all the earth. For [2was lifted  1your majesty] up above the heavens.

2. From out of the mouths of infants and ones nursing you ready praise because of  your enemies,  to depose the enemy and the avenger.

3. For I shall see the heavens, the works  of your fingers; the moon and stars which you founded.

4. What is man that you remember him? or a son of man that you visit him?

5. You lessened him short of any of the angels; with glory and honor you crowned him;

6. and you placed him over the works  of your hands. All things you submitted underneath  his feet --

7. sheep and oxen all together, and still also the cattle of the plain,

8. the winged creatures of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea -- the ones traveling over the paths of the seas.

9. O lord,  our Lord, how wonderful  is your name in all the earth.  

## Psalms 9

1.  The LORD Abides unto the Eon To the director; for the private things of the son; a psalm to David.  I shall make acknowledgment to you, O lord, with [2entire 3heart 1my]. I shall describe all  your wonders.

2. I will be glad and exult in you. I shall strum to your name, O highest one.

3. In the turning  of my enemy unto the rear, they shall weaken and be destroyed from your face.

4. For you made  my case and  my cause. You sat upon the throne -- the one judging righteousness.

5. You reproached nations, and [3perished 1the 2impious].  [2his name 1You wiped away] into the eon, and into the eon of the eon.

6. [3of the 4enemy 5failed 1The 2broadswords] unto the end; and [2cities 1you demolished]; [2was destroyed  1his memorial] with noise.

7. And the lord [2into 3the 4eon 1abides]. He prepared [2for 3judgment  1his throne].

8. And he will judge the inhabitable world in righteousness. He shall judge peoples with uprightness.

9. And the lord became a refuge to the needy; a helper at an opportune time in afflictions.

10. And [4hope 5upon 6you 1the ones 2knowing  3your name], for you abandoned not the ones seeking after you, O lord.

11. Strum to the lord! to the one dwelling in Zion. Announce among the nations  his practices!

12. For the one requiring  their blood he remembered. He did not forget the cry of the needy.

13. Show mercy on me, O lord! Behold  my humiliation from  my enemies! O one raising me from the gates  of death.

14. so that I should publish all  your praise at the gates of the daughter of Zion. We will exult over  your deliverance.

15. [2were stuck 1The nations] in corruption which they produced; by this snare which they hid [2was seized  1their own foot].

16. The lord is known [2judgments 1by executing]; [4by 5the 6works  7of his hands 3is seized 1the 2sinner]. AN ODE.

17. Let [3be turned 1the 2sinners] to  Hades! even all the nations  forgetting  God.

18. For [4not 6at 7the end 3shall 5be forgotten 1the 2poor]; the patience of the needy ones shall not perish to the end.

19. Rise up, O lord, do not let [2overpower 1man]! Let [2be judged 1the nations] before you!

20. Place, O lord, a lawgiver over them! Let [2know 1the nations] that they are men!  

## Psalms 10

1.  The LORD Breaks the Arm of the Wicked Why, O lord, have you abstained far off? neglected at opportune times in afflictions?

2. In the being prideful by the impious one, [3is burnt 1the 2poor one]; they are seized by the deliberations which they argue.

3. For [3applauds 1the 2sinner] in the desires  of his soul; and the one doing wrong blesses himself.

4. [3provoked 4the 5 lord 1The 2sinner] according to the magnitude  of his anger; he shall not seek after God; [2is not  1God] before him;

5. [2are profane  1his ways] at all time; [2are taken away  1your judgments] from in front of him; [2all  3his enemies 1he shall dominate].

6. For he said in his heart, In no way should I be shaken from generation to generation; I shall exist without bad happening;

7. whose curse  his mouth is full of, and bitterness, and treachery; under  his tongue is toil and misery;

8. he lies in wait to ambush with the rich in concealment,  to kill the innocent;  his eyes [2against 3the 4needy 1look].

9. He lies in wait in concealment as a lion in  his lair; he lies in wait  to snatch away the poor; to snatch away the poor when  he draws him. In  his snare he humbles him.

10. He shall bow and fall in  his dominating the needy.

11. For he said in  his heart, God has been forgotten, he turned  his face  to not see into the end.

12. Rise up, O lord  my God! Raise up high  your hand to not forget  your needy unto the end!

13. For what reason did [3provoke 5to anger 1the 2impious  4God]? For he said in his heart, He shall not require an account.

14. For you see. You [2misery 3and 4rage 1contemplate]  to deliver him into your hands. [3have been abandoned to you 1The 2poor], to the orphan you were a helper.

15. Break the arm of the sinner and wicked one! [2shall be sought for  1His sin], and in no way shall he be found.

16. The lord is king into the eon, and into the eon of the eon. You shall be destroyed, O nations, from out of  his land.

17. [2the 3desire 4of the 5needy 1You heard], O lord, [3the 4preparation  5of their heart 2took heed to  1your ear],

18. to judge orphans, and the humble; that [2should not 3proceed 4still  5to brag 1man] upon the earth.  

## Psalms 11

1.  The LORD Loves Justice For the director; a psalm to David.  Upon the lord I have yielded. How shall you say to my soul, Migrate unto the mountains as a sparrow?

2. For behold, the sinners stretch tight the bow; they prepare arrows for the quiver,  to shoot in moonlight the straight  in heart.

3. That which you readied, they demolished; but the just, what did they do?

4. The lord is in [2temple 1his holy]; the lord is in heaven  his throne;  his eyes [2unto 3the 4needy 1pay attention];  his eyelids inquire diligently of the sons  of men.

5. The lord inquires diligently to the just and the impious; but the one loving injustice detests  his own soul.

6. He shall rain [2upon 3sinners 1snares]; fire and sulphur and [2wind 1a gale] shall be the portion  of their cup.

7. For the lord is just, and [2righteousness 1he loves]; [3straightness 2perceived  1his face].  

## Psalms 12

1.  The LORD Hates Deceit To the director; for the eighth; a psalm to David.  Deliver me, O lord! for [2has failed 1the sacred one]; for [3were lessened 1the ones 2in truths] from the sons  of men.

2. [3vanity 2spoke 1Each] to  his neighbor. [2lips 1Deceitful] are in the heart, and by the heart he spoke evils.

3. Let the lord utterly destroy all the [2lips  1deceitful], and [2tongues 1lofty speaking]!

4. the ones having said,  [2our tongues 1We will magnify];  our lips [2for 3us 1are]; who [2our 3lord 1is]?

5. Because of the misery of the poor, and the moaning of the needy, now I will arise, says the lord, I will establish by deliverance, I will speak openly by him.

6. The oracles of the lord [2oracles 1are pure]; as silver tried in fire, proved in the earth, being purified seven-fold.

7. You, O lord, shall guard us, and you shall carefully keep us from  this generation, and into the eon.

8. [4round about 1The 2impious 3walk]. According to  your stature you took great care of the sons  of men.  

## Psalms 13

1.  The LORD Listens to the Afflicted To the director; a psalm to David.  For how long, O lord, will you forget me -- unto the end? For how long do you turn  your face from me?

2. Until what time shall I set plans in my soul, with griefs in my heart day and night? For how long shall [2be exalted  1my enemy] over me?

3. Look upon, hear me, O lord  my God! Enlighten  my eyes! lest at any time I should sleep in death;

4. lest at any time [2might say  1my enemy], I prevailed against him. The ones afflicting me shall exult if I should be shaken.

5. But I [2upon  3your mercy 1hoped]. [2shall exult  1My heart] over  your deliverance.

6. I shall sing to the lord, to the one benefiting me; and I will strum to the name of the lord the highest.  

## Psalms 14

1.  The Fool To the director; a psalm to David.  [2said 1The fool] in his heart, There is no God. They were corrupted and abhorrent in their practices. There is not one doing that which is good.

2. The lord from out of  heaven looked upon the sons  of men,  to see if there is one perceiving or inquiring of  God.

3. All turned aside together; they were made useless; there is not one doing that which is good; there is not even one.

4. Do [5not 6know 1all 2the ones 3working  4lawlessness], the ones devouring  my people as the food of bread? [2the 3 lord 1They called not upon].

5. There they were timid with fear, of which there was no fear; for  God is with the generation of the just.

6. The counsel of the poor you disgraced, for the lord [2hope 1is his].

7. Who will grant from Zion the deliverance  of Israel? In the lord turning the captivity  of his people, Jacob shall exult, and Israel shall be glad.  

## Psalms 15

1.  The Unblemished Shall Dwell with The LORD A psalm to David.  O lord, who shall sojourn in  your tent, or who shall encamp in [2mountain 1your holy]?

2. The one going unblemished, and working righteousness, speaking truth in his heart;

3. who did not speak treacherously with his tongue, and did not do  [2to his neighbor 1bad], and [4scorning 1did not 2take 3up] against the ones near him.

4. [2is treated with contempt 3before 4him 1The one acting wickedly]; but the one fearing the lord he glorifies, even the one swearing by an oath to his neighbor and not annulling it;

5.  his money he did not give for interest, and bribes from the innocent he did not take. The one doing these things shall not be shaken into the eon.  

## Psalms 16

1.  The LORD is My Portion An inscription on a monument; to David.  Guard me, O lord, for upon you I hoped!

2. I said to the lord, [2my lord 1You are], for  [4of my goodness 2no 3need 1you have].

3. [4the 5holy ones  6in  7his land 3wondered 1The 2 lord], all  his willing ones among them.

4. [2were multiplied  1Their weaknesses] -- [2after 3these gods 1they that hastened]. In no way shall I bring together the ones of their gathering for blood, nor in any way shall I mention  their names through my lips.

5. The lord is the portion  of my inheritance and  of my cup. You are the one restoring  my inheritance to me.

6. The measuring lines fallen to me in the most excellent places. Yes, for  my inheritance [2most excellent 1is to me].

7. I will bless the lord, the one bringing understanding to me; but still also until night [2corrected 3me  1my kidneys].

8. I foresaw the lord before me always; for [2on 3my right 1he is] that I should not be shaken.

9. On account of this [2was glad  1my heart], and [2exulted  1my tongue]; and still also  my flesh shall encamp in hope.

10. For you shall not abandon  my soul in Hades, nor shall you give  your sacred one to see corruption.

11. You made known to me the ways of life. You shall fill me of gladness with  your face. Delightfulness is at  your right unto the end.  

## Psalms 17

1.  The LORD Listens to Our Just Cause A prayer to David.  Hear, O lord,  my righteousness! Take heed to my supplication! Give ear to my prayer not uttered by [2lips 1deceitful]!

2. [4from 5your presence  2my judgment 1May 3come forth];  [2my eyes 1let] behold uprightness!

3. You tried  my heart; you visited at night; you set me on fire, and [2was not found 3in 4me 1injustice], so that [2should not 3speak  1my mouth].

4. Concerning the works  of men, by the words  of your lips I guarded [2ways 1hard].

5. Fashion  my footsteps in  your roads! that [2should not 3be shaken  1my footsteps].

6. I cried, for you heeded me, O God; lean  your ear to me, and hear  my words!

7. Show the wonder  of your mercies! O one delivering the ones hoping upon you, from the ones opposing at your right.

8. Guard me, O lord, as the pupil of the eye! Under the protection  of your wings shelter me!

9. even from the face of the impious  ones causing misery for me.  My enemies  [2my soul 1compass].

10.  [2in their own fat 1They are enclosed];  their mouth speaks pride.

11. They are casting me out now; they surrounded me;  their eyes set to turn me to the ground.

12. [6they undertook 7me 1As 2a lion 3prepared 4for 5a hunt], and as a cub living in concealment.

13. Rise up, O lord! Be there beforehand with them, and trip them! Rescue  my soul from the impious by your broadsword!

14. From the enemies  by your hand, O lord; from the few of the earth; divide them in  their life. And  of your things being hidden [2was filled  1their belly]; they were filled of sons, and [3they leave 1the 2remnants] to their infants.

15. But I [4in 5righteousness 1shall appear  2in front 3of you]. I shall be filled in  [3appearing 4to me  1your glory].  

## Psalms 18

1.  The LORD is Our Deliverance To the director; to the servant of the lord; to David; what he spoke to the lord; the words  of this ode, in the day in which [3rescued 4him 1the 2 lord] from out of the hand of all  his enemies, and from out of the hand of Saul. And he said;  I shall love you, O lord, of my strength.

2. The lord is my firmament, and my refuge, and my rescuer. My God is my helper, and I will hope upon him; my defender and horn of my deliverance, and my shielder.

3. In praising, I will call upon the lord; and from  my enemies I shall be delivered.

4. [3compassed 4me 1Pangs 2of death], and rushing streams of lawlessness disturbed me.

5. Pangs of Hades surrounded me; [3anticipated 4me 1snares 2of death].

6. And in  my being afflicted I called upon the lord, and to  my God I cried out. He heard [2from out of 4temple 3his holy 1my voice], and  my cry before him shall enter into  his ears.

7. And it was shaken; and trembling took place on the earth; and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed and shaken; for [2was provoked to anger 3by them  1God].

8. [2ascended 1Smoke] in his anger, and fire from in front of him. [2shall be ignited 1Coals]; they were lit by him.

9. And he leaned the heavens, and came down, and dimness was under  his feet.

10. And he mounted upon cherubim, and he spread out; he spread out upon wings of winds.

11. And he established darkness for his concealment. Round about him  was his tent; dark water in clouds of air.

12. From the radiance of his presence the clouds went by; hail and coals of fire.

13. And [2thundered 3from out of 4heaven 1the lord], and the highest uttered his voice.

14. And he sent out arrows, and dispersed them; and [2lightnings 1he multiplied], and disturbed them.

15. And appeared the springs  of waters; and [5were uncovered 1the 2foundations 3of the 4inhabitable world] from your reproach, O lord, from the blasting breath of your anger.

16. He sent from the height, and he took me; he took me to himself from out of [2waters 1many].

17. He will rescue me from [3enemies 1my 2mighty], and from the ones detesting me; for they are more solidified than me.

18. They went before me in the day of my ill-treatment, and the lord became my support.

19. And he brought me into an enlargement. He shall rescue me, for he wanted me.

20. And [2shall recompense 3to me 1the lord] according to  my righteousness; even according to the cleanliness  of my hands he will recompense to me.

21. For I guarded the ways of the lord, and did not impiously depart from  my God.

22. For all  his judgments are before me; and  his ordinances did not leave from me.

23. And I will be unblemished with him; and I shall guard myself from  my lawlessness.

24. And [2shall recompense 3to me 1the lord] according to  my righteousness, and according to the cleanliness  of my hands before  his eyes.

25. With the sacred you shall be sacred; and with [2man 1the innocent] you shall be innocent;

26. and with the choice one, you will be choice; and with the crooked you shall turn aside from.

27. For you [3people 2the humble 1will deliver], and the eyes of the proud you will humble.

28. For you shall light my lamp, O lord  my God; you shall lighten  my darkness.

29. For by you I shall be rescued from the band of marauders; and by  my God I shall pass over the wall.

30.  My God -- unblemished is  his way. The oracles of the lord are tried by fire. He is a defender of all the ones hoping upon him.

31. For who is God besides the lord? Or who is God besides  our God?

32.  God is the one girding me with power, and makes [2unblemished  1my way];

33. the one readying  my feet as a stag, and [3upon 4the 5high places 1setting 2me];

34. teaching my hands for war; and you made [2as the bow 3of brass  1my arms];

35. and you gave to me a shielding deliverance; and  your right hand takes hold of me; and  your instruction re-erects me unto the end; and  your instruction itself teaches me.

36. You widened  my footsteps underneath me, and [2weakened not  1my soles].

37. I shall pursue  my enemies and overtake them; and I will not return until whenever they should cease.

38. I shall squeeze them, and in no way should they be able to stand; they shall fall under  my feet.

39. And you girded me in power for war; you bound hand and foot all the ones rising up against me underneath me.

40. And  [4of my enemies 1you gave 2to me 3the back]; and the ones detesting me you utterly destroyed.

41. They cried out [3and 4there was no one  5delivering 1to 2the lord], and he did not hear them.

42. And I will make them as fine as dust against the face of the wind; as mud in the squares I will grind them.

43. You shall rescue me from a dispute of people; you shall place me at the head of nations; a people whom I knew not shall serve to me;

44. in the hearing of the ear they obeyed me. [2sons 1Alien] lied to me.

45. [2sons 1Alien] grew old and became lame from  their paths.

46. The lord lives, and blessed is  God, and [4is raised up high 1the 2God  3of my deliverance].

47. The God, the one granting acts of vengeance to me, and submitting peoples under me;

48.  my rescuer from my enemies prone to anger. [2from 3the ones 4rising up 5against 6me 1You raised me up high]; from [2man 1the unjust] you shall rescue me.

49. On account of this I shall make acknowledgment to you among the nations, O lord, and to your name I shall strum;

50. the one magnifying the deliverance of the king; and appointing mercy to his anointed one, to David and to his seed unto the eon.  

## Psalms 19

1.  The Heavens Describe the Glory of God For the director; a psalm to David.  The heavens describe the glory of God, [5the making 1and 6of his hands 4announces 2the 3firmament].

2. Day to day bubbles up a saying; and night unto night announces knowledge.

3. There are no speeches nor words which [2are not 3heard  1their voices].

4. Into all the earth went forth  their knell; and unto the ends of the inhabitable world  their words. [3in 4the 5sun 1He put  2his tent].

5. And he, as a groom going forth from out of his nuptial chamber, shall exult as a giant running a journey.

6. From one tip  of heaven is his exiting, and  his arrival unto the other tip  of heaven; and there is not one who shall be concealed  from his heat.

7. The law of the lord is unblemished, turning souls. The witness of the lord is trustworthy, making wise the infants.

8. The ordinances of the lord are straight, making glad the heart. The commandment of the lord is radiant, giving light to the eyes.

9. The fear of the lord is pure, abiding into the eon of the eon. The judgments of the lord are true, doing justice to the same;

10. desirable above gold, and [3stone 2precious 1much], and sweeter above honey and the honeycomb.

11. For also  your servant guards them; in the guarding of them [2reward 1there is great].

12. [3his transgressions 1Who 2shall perceive]? From out of  my private transgressions cleanse me!

13. And from the aliens spare  your servant! If they should not dominate me, then I will be unblemished, and I shall be cleansed of [2sin 1great].

14. And [4will be 5for 6benevolence 1the 2oracles  3of my mouth], and the meditation  of my heart before you always, O lord, my helper and the one ransoming me.

2. May he send to you help from the holy place, and from Zion may he assist you.

3. May [4be remembered 1every 2sacrifice 3of yours], and  [2your whole burnt-offering 1let him fatten]!

4. May [2give 3to you 1the lord] according to  your heart, and [2all  3your plans 1fulfill].

5. We will exult over  your deliverance; and in the name of the lord our God we will be magnified. May the lord fill all  your requests.

6. Now I knew that the lord delivered  his anointed one; he shall heed him from out of [2heaven 1his holy]. By dominations is the deliverance  of his right hand.

7. These in chariots, and these in horses -- but we [2in 3the name 4of the lord 5our God 1shall call].

8. They are bound hand and foot, and they fall; but we rose up and were re-erected.

9. O lord, preserve the king, and heed us in what ever day we should call upon you!  

## Psalms 21

1.  The LORD Gives the Desire of the Heart A psalm to David.  O lord, [4in  5your power 3shall be glad 1the 2king]; and over  your deliverance he shall exult exceedingly.

2. The desire  of his heart you gave to him; and the supplication  of his lips you did not deprive him.

3. For you were [3beforehand 1with 2him] in blessings of graciousness. You put upon  his head a crown of [2stone 1precious].

4. [2life 1He asked] of you, and you gave to him duration of days, into the eon of the eon.

5. [2is great  1His glory] in  your deliverance; glory and majesty you shall place upon him.

6. For you shall give to him a blessing into the eon of the eon; you shall gladden him with joy with  your countenance.

7. For the king hopes upon the lord, and in the mercy of the highest in no way shall he be shaken.

8. May [2be found  1your hand] by all  your enemies;  [2your right hand 1may] be found by all the ones detesting you.

9. For you shall put them as an oven of fire in the time  of your person; the lord in his anger disturbs them, and [2shall devour 3them 1fire].

10.  [2their fruit 3from 4the earth 1You shall destroy]; and  their seed from the sons of men.

11. For they leaned [2to 3you 1bad things], they argued over plans which in no way might they be able to establish.

12. For you shall put of them their back among  your residue; you shall prepare  their front.

13. Be raised up high, O lord, in  your power! We shall sing and strum  of your dominations.  

## Psalms 22

1.  The LORD is Our Hope To the director; for the assistance of the early morning; a psalm to David.  O God,  my God, take heed to me! Why did you abandon me? [4are far 5from  6my deliverance 1The 2words  3of my transgressions].

3. But you [2in 3the holy place 1dwell], the high praise  of Israel.

4. Upon you [2hoped  1our fathers]; they hoped, and you rescued them.

5. To you they cried out, and they were delivered; upon you they hoped, and they were not disgraced.

6. But I am a worm, and not a man; the scorn of men, and a contemptible thing of people.

7. All the ones viewing me derided me; they speak with their lips, they shook their head, saying,

8. He hoped upon the lord, let him rescue him! Let him deliver him! for he desired him.

9. For you are the one pulling me from the womb;  my hope from the breasts  of my mother.

10. [2upon 3you 1I was cast] from the womb; from out of the belly of my mother [2my God 1you are].

11. Do not separate from me, for affliction is near, for there is no  one helping me.

12. [3surround 4me 2calves 1Many]; [2bulls 1hearty] compass me.

13. They opened [2against 3me  1their mouths], as a lion snatching away and roaring.

14. As water was poured out, even [3were dispersed 1all  2my bones]; [2became  1my heart] as beeswax melting away in the midst  of my belly.

15. [2was dried 3as 4a potsherd  1My strength], and  my tongue cleaves to my throat. And to the dust of death you led me.

16. For [3encircled 4me 2dogs 1many]; the gathering of the ones acting wicked compass me. They dug into my hands and my feet.

17. They counted out all  my bones, and they contemplated and looked upon me.

18. They divided [2into parts  1my garments] to themselves; and over  my clothes they cast a lot.

19. But you, O lord, [2should not be far  1your help] from me; [2to  3my assistance 1take heed]!

20. Rescue [2from 3the broadsword  1my soul], and [2from 3the hand 4of the dog  1my only child]!

21. Deliver me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the unicorns  of my humiliation!

22. I shall describe  your name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you.

23. O ones fearing the lord -- praise him! All together, O seed of Jacob, glorify him! Fear indeed of him all together, O seed of Israel!

24. For he did not treat with contempt, nor loath the supplication of the poor, nor turned  his face from me. And in  my crying out to him, he heard me.

25. [2is about 3you  1My high praise]. In [2assembly 1the great] I shall confess to you.  My vows I shall render in the presence of the ones fearing him.

26. [2shall eat 1The needy] and shall be filled up; and [4shall praise 5the lord 1the ones 2seeking 3him]; [2shall live  1their hearts] into the eon of the eon.

27. [6shall remember 7and 8shall turn 9to 10the lord 1All 2the ones 3at the ends 4of the 5earth]; and [6shall do obeisance 7before 8him 1all 2the 3families 4of the 5nations].

28. For of the lord is the kingdom; and he is master of the nations.

29. [6ate 7and 8did obeisance 1All 2the 3hearty 4of the 5earth]; [8before 9him 7fell down 1all 2the ones 3going down 4into 5the 6earth]. And  my soul lives for him.

30. And  my seed shall serve to him. [3shall be announced 4to the 5 lord 1The generation  2coming].

31. And they shall announce  his righteousness to a people, to the one being born, whom [3made 1the 2 lord].  

## Psalms 23

1.  The LORD Tends Me A psalm to David.  The lord tends me, and not one thing lacks for me.

2. In the place of tender shoots, there he encamped me. At the water of rest, he nourished me.

3.  [2my life 1He returned]; he guided me upon roads of righteousness because of  his name.

4. For if even I should go in the midst of the shadow of death, I shall not be afraid of evils, for you [2with 3me 1are].  Your rod and  your staff, they comfort me.

5. You prepared before me a table, right opposite the ones afflicting me. You anointed [2with 3oil  1my head], and  your cup is intoxicating me as most excellent.

6. And  your mercy pursues me all the days  of my life; and  my dwelling is in the house of the lord for duration of days.  

## Psalms 24

1.  The Earth is The LORD's A psalm to David of the one of the Sabbaths.  [3is of the 4 lord 1The 2earth], and the fullness of it; the inhabitable world, and all the ones dwelling in it.

2. He [3upon 4seas 1founded 2it]; and upon rivers he prepared it.

3. Who shall ascend into the mountain of the lord, or who shall stand in [2place 1his holy]?

4. Innocent hands and a pure  heart, who did not take hold upon vain things  for his soul, and did not swear by an oath with treachery against his neighbor.

5. This one shall receive a blessing by the lord, and charity from God his deliverer.

6. This is the generation seeking the lord, seeking the face of the God of Jacob.

7. Let [2lift 3the gates  1your rulers]! and let [3be lifted up 2gates 1the eternal]! and [4shall enter 1the 2king  3of glory].

8. Who is this  king  of glory? The lord, fortified and mighty; the lord mighty in battle.

9. Let [2lift 3the gates  1your rulers]! and let [3be lifted up 2gates 1the eternal]! and [4shall enter 1the 2king  3of glory].

## Psalms 25

1.  The LORD is Truth and Mercy A psalm to David.  To you, O lord, I lifted up  my soul.

2. O my God, upon you I have yielded. May I not be disgraced into the eon; nor let [2ridicule 3me  1my enemies]!

3.  For all the ones remaining with you in no way shall be disgraced. Let [4be ashamed 1the 2ones acting lawlessly 3without cause]!

4.  Your ways, O lord, make known to me! and  [3your paths 1teach 2me]!

5. Guide me with  your truth! and teach me that you are  God  my deliverer! and I waited on you all the day.

6. Remember  your compassions, O lord, and  your mercies! for [2from 3the 4eon 1they are].

7. [3the sins 4of my youth 5and 6my ignorance 1Do not 2remember]! but according to  your mercy mention me to yourself, because of  your graciousness, O lord!

13.  His soul [2in 3good things 1shall be lodged], and  his seed shall inherit the earth.

14. The lord is a fortification of the ones fearing him; and  his covenant he manifested to them.

15.  My eyes are always towards the lord, for he shall pull out [2from 3the snare  1my feet].

16. Look upon me and have mercy on me! for [3an only child 4and 5poor 2am 1I].

19. Behold  my enemies! for they were multiplied, and [4hatred 3with unjust 1they detested 2me].

20. Guard  my soul, and rescue me! May I not be disgraced, for I hoped upon you.

## Psalms 26

1.  The LORD Sets the Hearts on Fire A psalm to David.  Judge me, O lord! for I [2in 3my innocence 1went], and [2upon 3the 4 lord 1hoping]. In no way should I weaken.

3. For  your mercy [2before  3my eyes 1is]; and I was well-pleased in  your truth.

4. I sat not with the sanhedrin of folly; and with ones acting unlawfully in no way shall I enter.

6. I shall wash [2in 3innocent things  1my hands], and I shall encircle  your altar, O lord,

9. You should not destroy together [2with 3the impious  1my soul], nor [2with 3the men 4of blood  1my life],

10. in whose hands  are lawless deeds, and their right hand was filled of bribes.

11. But I [2in 3my innocence 1was gone]. Ransom me, and show mercy on me!

12.  My foot stands in straightness. In the assemblies I shall bless you, O lord.  

## Psalms 27

1.  Seek the Face of The LORD A psalm to David; before his anointing.  The lord is my illumination and my deliverer, in whom shall I fear? The lord is the defender  of my life, from whom shall I be timid?

2. In the approaching against me by the ones inflicting evil  to devour  my flesh, the ones afflicting me, and  my enemies, they weakened and fell.

3. If [2should deploy 3against 4me 1a camp], [2shall not 3fear  1my heart]. If [2should rise up 3against 4me 1war], in this I will be hopeful.

4. One thing I asked of the lord, this I shall seek --  for me to dwell in the house of the lord all the days  of my life;  for me to view the delightfulness of the lord, and to visit  [2temple  1his holy].

5. For he hides me in his tent; in a day of my evils he sheltered me in concealment  of his tent; in a rock he raised me up high.

6. And now behold, he raised up high  my head over my enemies. I encircled and sacrificed in  his tent a sacrifice of praise and of a shout; I shall sing and strum to the lord.

9. You should not turn  your face from me, and you should not turn aside in anger from  your servant. [2my helper 1Become]! Do not curse me to be far away, and do not abandon me, and do not overlook me, O God  my deliverer!

10. For  my father and  my mother abandoned me, but the lord took me to himself.

11. Establish the law for me, O lord, in  your way! And guide me in [2road 1the straight], because of  my enemies!

12. Do not deliver me into the souls of ones afflicting me! For [3rose up against 4me 2witnesses 1unjust]; for [2lied  1unjustness] to herself.

13. I trust  to behold the good things of the lord in the land of the living.

14. Wait on the lord! Be manly and fortify  your heart, and wait on the lord!  

## Psalms 28

1.  The LORD Listens to His Servants A psalm to David.  To you, O lord, I shall cry out.  My God, do not remain silent from me! lest at any time you should remain silent, and I shall be likened to the ones going down into the pit.

3. Do not draw me together with sinners! And [3with 4ones working 5injustice 1do not 2destroy me together]! of the ones speaking peace with  their neighbors, but evils are in  their hearts.

4. Give to them, O lord, according to  their works, and according to the wickedness  of their practices! [3according to 4the 5works  6of their hands 1Give 2to them]! Render  their recompense unto them!

5. For they perceived not unto the works of the lord, even unto the works  of his hands. You shall demolish them, and in no way build them up.

6. Blessed be the lord, for he heard the voice  of my supplication.

7. The lord is my helper and my defender; upon him [2hoped  1my heart], and I was helped; and [2flourished again  1my flesh], and by my will I will make acknowledgment to him.

8. The lord is the fortification  of his people, and [2the defender 3of the 4deliverances  5of his anointed one 1he is].

9. Deliver  your people, and bless  your inheritance, and tend them, and lift them up unto the eon!

3. The voice of the lord is upon the waters. The God  of glory thunders. The lord is upon [2waters 1many].

4. The voice of the lord is in strength. The voice of the lord is in majesty.

5. The voice of the lord breaking cedars; even the lord breaks the cedars  of Lebanon;

6. and he shall thin them out as the calf  of Lebanon; even the one being loved as a son of unicorns.

7. The voice of the lord cutting through the flame of fire.

8. The voice of the lord shaking the wilderness; and the lord shall shake the wilderness of Kadesh.

9. The voice of the lord fashioning the hinds; and he shall uncover the groves; and in  his temple all who say, Glory.

## Psalms 30

1.  The LORD is My Helper A psalm of an ode of the dedication of the house of David.  I will exalt you, O lord, for you uplifted me, and [2did not 3make glad  1my enemies] over me.

2. O lord  my God, I cried out to you, and I shall heal of my condition.

3. O lord, you led [2from out of 3Hades  1my soul]; you delivered me from the ones going down into the pit.

4. Let [2strum 3to the 4 lord  1his sacred ones], and make acknowledgment to the remembrance  of his holiness!

5. For wrath is in  his rage, but life is in  his will. [3the 4evening 2shall lodge 1Weeping], but in the morning, exultation.

6. And I said in  my prosperity, In no way shall I be shaken into the eon.

7. O lord, in  your will you furnished [2to 3my beauty 1power]; but you turned  your face, and I became disturbed.

8. To you, O lord, I cry out. And to  my God I shall beseech.

9. What benefit is there in  my blood, in  my going down into corruption? Shall [2acknowledge 3you 1the dust], or shall it announce  your truth?

10. The lord heard, and showed mercy on me. The lord became my helper.

11. [3turned 1The 2beating of my breast] into joy for me. You tore up  my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.

12. O how that should [2strum 3to you  1my glory], and in no way should I be vexed, O lord  my God. Into the eon I shall acknowledge you.  

## Psalms 31

1.  The LORD is Our Refuge To the director; a psalm to David; a change of state.  Upon you, O lord, I hoped. May I not be disgraced into the eon. In  your righteousness rescue me, and take me out!

2. Lean [2to 3me  1your ear]! Hasten  to take me out! Become to me as a defending God! and for a house of refuge  to deliver me.

3. For [2my fortification 3and 4my refuge 1you are]; and because of  your name you shall guide me and nourish me.

4. You shall lead me out of the snare which these hid for me; for you are  my defender, O lord.

5. Into your hands I shall place  my spirit. You ransomed me, O lord  God  of truth.

6. You detested the ones guarding [2follies 1ineffectual]. But I [2upon 3the 4 lord 1hoped].

7. I will exult and be glad over  your mercy, for you looked upon  my humiliation. You delivered [2from 3the wants 4of necessities  1my soul];

8. and you did not close me up by hands of enemies. You set [2in 3a broad space  1my feet].

9. Show mercy on me, O lord! for I am afflicted. [5are disturbed 6in 7rage  1My eye  2my soul 3and  4my belly];

10. for [2failed 3in 4grief  1my life], and  my years in moanings. [2weakened 3in 4poorness  1My strength], and  my bones are disturbed.

11. By all  my enemies I became a scorn, even to my neighbors exceedingly so, and a fear to my acquaintances. The ones viewing me outside fled from me.

12. I was forgotten as one dead from the heart; I am become as a vessel being destroyed.

13. For I heard the fault of many sojourning round about. In  their gathering together against me  [2to take  3my soul 1they consulted].

14. But I [2upon 3you 4O lord 1hoped]. I said, You are  my God.

15. [2are in  3your hands  1My lots]. Rescue me from the hand of my enemies, and from the ones pursuing me!

16. Let [2appear  1your face] unto  your servant! Deliver me in  your mercy!

17. O lord, may I not be disgraced, for I called upon you. May [3be ashamed 1the 2impious], and led down into Hades.

18. [7speechless 1Let 6become 2the 3lips 4of the 5deceitful]! even the ones speaking against the just in lawlessness with pride and contempt.

19. How abundant is the multitude  of your graciousness, O lord, of which you hid to the ones fearing you. You brought it to completion to the ones hoping upon you, before the sons  of men.

20. You shall hide them in the concealment  of your face from the disturbance of men. You shall shelter them in a tent from the dispute of tongues.

21. Blessed be the lord, for [2caused wonders  1his mercy] in the city encompassed about.

22. But I said in  my change of state, I am thrown away from in front  of your eyes. On account of this you heard of the voice  of my supplication in  my crying out to you.

23. Let [3love 4the 5 lord 1all  2his sacred ones]! For [3truth 2requires 1the lord]; and he recompenses [2to the ones 1extremely] having pride.

24. Let [6be manly 7and 8be fortified 9in 10your heart 1all 2the ones 3hoping 4upon 5the lord]!  

## Psalms 32

1.  David Confesses His Lawlessness A psalm to David; for understanding.  Blessed be whose [2were forgiven  1lawless deeds], and whose [2were covered over  1sins].

2. Blessed be the man to whom in no way the lord should impute sin, nor is [2in  3his mouth 1treachery].

3. For I kept quiet; [2were grown old  1my bones] from  my crying out the entire  day.

4. For day and night [2presses 3upon 4me  1your hand]. I was turned to misery by the [2sticking 3me 1thorn].

5.  My lawlessness I made known, and  my sin I did not cover. I said, I will declare openly against myself  my lawlessness to the lord. And you forgave the impiety  of my heart. PAUSE.

6. For this [3shall pray 4to 5you 1every 2sacred one] in [2time 1a fit]; only in a flood of waters many [3to 4him 1shall not 2approach].

7. You are my refuge from affliction  encompassing me;  my leap for joy to ransom me from the ones encircling me. PAUSE.

8. I will bring understanding to you, and I will instruct you in this way which you shall go. I will stay [2upon 3you  1my eyes].

9. Do not become as a horse and mule in which there is no understanding; but with muzzle and bridle  [2their jaws 1may you squeeze] of the ones not approaching to you.

10. Many are the whips for the sinner; [4the one 1but 5hoping 6upon 7the lord 2mercy 3shall encircle].

11. Be glad upon the lord, and exult, O just ones! and let [6boast 1all 2the ones 3straight 4in the 5heart]!

5. [3loves 4charity 5and 6equity 1The 2 lord]; [4of the 5mercy 6of the lord 3is full 1the 2earth].

6. By the word of the lord the heavens were solidified, and by the breath  of his mouth all  their force;

7. bringing together as in a leather water bag the waters of the sea; putting in treasuries of the deeps.

8. Fear the lord all the earth! [2because of 3him 1and] let [6be shaken 1all 2the 3ones dwelling 4in the 5inhabitable world]!

9. For he spoke, and they came to pass; he gave charge, and they were created.

10. The lord effaces plans of nations, and he annuls devices of peoples, and he annuls plans of rulers.

11. But the counsel of the lord [2into 3the 4eon 1abides]; the devices  of his heart from generation and generation.

12. Blessed is the nation of which the lord is  its God; a people whom he chose for his own inheritance.

13. From out of heaven [3looks 1the 2 lord]; he beholds all the sons  of men.

14. From [2prepared 3home 1his] he looked upon all the ones dwelling on the earth.

15. He is the one shaping [2alone  1their hearts]; the one perceiving in all  their works.

16. [2is not 3delivered 1A king] because of much force; and a giant shall not be delivered by the magnitude of his strength.

17. [2is a false hope 1A horse] for deliverance, and in the magnitude of its power one shall not be delivered.

18. Behold, the eyes of the lord are upon the ones fearing him; the ones hoping upon  his mercy;

19. to rescue [2from 3death  1their souls], and to nourish them during famine.

20.  And our soul waits on the lord, for [2helper 3and 4defender 1he is our].

21. For in him [2shall be glad  1our heart]; and in  [2name  1his holy] we hope.

22. May [2come  1your mercy], O lord, upon us, just as we hoped upon you.  

## Psalms 34

1.  The LORD Rescues from Afflictions A psalm to David, when he changed  his countenance before Abimelech, and he loosened him, and he went forth.  I will bless the lord at all time; always  his praise is in  my mouth.

2. [3in 4the 5 lord 2shall applaud  1My soul]. Let [2hear 1the gentle] and be glad!

3. Magnify the lord with me! for we should raise up high  his name together.

4. I sought after the lord, and he heeded me; and out of all  my afflictions he rescued me.

5. Come forward to him, and be enlightened! and  your faces in no way shall be disgraced.

6. This  poor man cried out, and the lord heard him; and from out of all  his afflictions he delivered him.

7. [3will encamp 1The angel 2of the lord] round about the ones fearing him, and he will rescue them.

8. Taste and see that [3is gracious 1the 2 lord]! Blessed is the man who hopes upon him.

9. Let [3fear 4the 5 lord 1all  2his holy ones]! for there is no deficiency to the ones fearing him.

10. The rich became poor, and they hunger; but the ones seeking after the lord shall not lack any good thing.

11. Come children, hear me! [3a fear 4of the lord 1I will teach 2you].

12. Who is the man  wanting life, loving [3days 1to behold 2good]?

13. Cease  your tongue from evil! and your lips, so as to not speak treachery.

14. Turn aside from the bad, and do good! Seek peace, and pursue it!

15. The eyes of the lord are upon the just, and his ears are unto their supplication.

16. But the face of the lord is against the ones committing evils,  to utterly destroy [2from 3the earth  1their memorial].

17. [3cried out 1The 2just], and the lord heard them; and from out of all  their afflictions he rescued them.

18. The lord is near to the ones being broken  in heart; and the humble  in spirit he shall deliver.

19. Many are the afflictions of the just; and from out of all of them [3shall rescue 4them 1the 2 lord].

20. The lord guards all  their bones; [2one 3of 4them 1not] shall be broken.

21. The death of sinners is a sorry state; and the ones detesting the just shall offend.

22. The lord shall ransom the souls of his servants; and in no way shall [6offend 1all 2the 3ones hoping 4upon 5him].  

## Psalms 35

1.  The LORD Pleads Our Cause A psalm to David.  Adjudicate, O lord, the ones wronging me! Wage war against the ones waging war against me!

2. Take hold of weapon and shield, and rise up to help me!

3. Discharge the broadsword, and close up right opposite the ones pursuing me! Say to my soul, [2your deliverance 1I am]!

4. Let [4be ashamed 5and 6feel remorse 1the 2ones seeking  3my soul]! Let them be turned to the rear, and let [4be disgraced 1the ones 2considering 3evils against me]!

5. Let them become as dust according to the face of the wind! and an angel of the lord squeezing them.

6. Let [2become  1their way] darkness and slippery! and an angel of the lord pursuing them.

7. For without cause they hid [3against me 2of corruption 1their snare]; in folly they berate  my soul.

8. Let there come to him a snare which he knows not! And the snare of the hunt which he hid, let it seize him! and in the same snare he shall fall in it.

9.  But my soul shall exult over the lord; it shall be made happy over  his deliverance.

10. All  my bones shall say, O lord, O lord, who is likened to you? rescuing the poor from the hand of the one more solid than he, and the poor and needy one from the ones tearing him in pieces.

11. Rising up against me [2witnesses 1are unjust], [3of things which 4I did not 5know 1asking 2me].

12. They recompensed to me evil for good, and childlessness to my soul.

13. But I, in  their troubling me, put on sackcloth. And I humbled [2in 3fasting  1my soul]; and  my prayer [2unto 3my bosom 1shall be returned].

14. As a neighbor, as [2brother 1to our], so they were well-pleasing. As mourning and looking downcast so I humbled myself.

15. And against me they were glad and they gathered together; they gathered together [2against 3me 1whips], and I did not know; they were cut asunder and were not vexed.

16. They tested me; they derided me in sneering; they gnashed against me  with their teeth.

17. O lord, when will you scrutinize? Restore  my soul from  their evil actions; [2from 3lions  1my only child].

18. I shall make acknowledgment to you in [2assembly 1the vast]; with [2people 1grievous] I shall praise you.

19. May [5not 6rejoice against 7me 1the ones 2hating 3me 4unjustly]; even the ones detesting me without a charge, and shunning their eyes.

20. For to me then [2peaceable 1they spoke], but in anger [2treachery 1they devised].

21. And they widened [2against 3me  1their mouth]. They said, Well done, well done, [2saw  1our eyes]!

22. You beheld, O lord. You should not remain silent, O lord. You should not separate from me.

23. Awake, O lord, and take heed to my case, O my God, and [3O 4my lord 1to  2my cause]!

24. Judge me, O lord, according to  your righteousness, O lord  my God, and let them not rejoice against me!

25. May they not say in their heart, Well done, well done to our soul. Nor may they say, We swallowed him down.

26. May they be ashamed, and may [4feel remorse 5together 1the ones 2rejoicing at  3my hurts]. Let [5be clothed in 6shame 7and 8remorse 1the ones 2speaking great words 3against 4me]!

27. Exult and be glad, O ones wanting  righteousness for me! And let say always, [3be magnified 1The 2 lord]! by the ones wanting the peace  of his servant.

28. And  my tongue shall meditate upon  your righteousness; the entire  day  on your high praise.  

## Psalms 36

1.  The LORD Detests the Lawbreaker To the director, to the servant of the lord, to David.  [3speaks 1The 2lawbreaker  6so as to sin 4in 5himself]; there is no fear of God before  his eyes.

2. For he acted treacherously before him, so as to find out  his lawlessness and detest.

3. The sayings  of his mouth are lawlessness and treachery; he wanted not to perceive  how to do good.

4. [2lawlessness 1He reasons] upon  his bed; he renders to every way not good; and evil he did not loath.

5. O lord, [2is in 3the 4heaven  1your mercy], and  your truth unto the clouds.

6.  Your righteousness is as the mountains of God;  your judgments [2abyss 1a vast]. [2men 3and 4cattle 1You shall preserve], O lord.

7. How you multiplied  your mercy, O God; and the sons  of men [2in 3the protection  4of your wings 1shall hope].

8. They shall be intoxicated from the fatness of your house; and [3of the 4rushing stream  5of your delicacy 1you shall water 2them].

9. For from you is the spring of life. In  your light we shall see light.

10. Extend  your mercy to the ones knowing you, and  your righteousness to the ones straight  in heart!

11. Let not [3come 4against me 1the foot 2of pride]! nor the hand of the sinner to shake me.

12. There they fell -- all the ones working  lawlessness. They were pushed out, and in no way shall they be able to stand.  

## Psalms 37

1.  The Just Shall Inherit the Earth A psalm to David.  Be not provoked to jealousy with ones acting wickedly, nor be jealous of the ones doing  lawlessness!

2. For [3as 4grass 2quickly 1they shall be dried up], and as vegetation of tender shoots they shall quickly fall away.

3. Hope upon the lord, and execute graciousness! And encamp in the land! and you shall be tended by  its riches.

4. Revel in the lord! that he should give to you the requests  of your heart.

5. Reveal to the lord  your way, and hope upon him! and he will act.

6. And he shall bring forth [2as 3light  1your righteousness], and  your practice as at midday.

7. Submit to the lord, and entreat him! Be not provoked to jealousy in the prospering [5in  6his way 1by 2a man 3doing 4unlawfulness]!

8. Cease from anger, and abandon rage! Be not provoked to jealousy so as to do wicked!

9. For the ones doing wicked shall be utterly destroyed; but the ones waiting on the lord, they shall inherit the land.

10. And yet in a short time, and in no way shall [2exist 1the sinner]; and if shall you seek  his place, then in no way shall you find it.

11. But the gentle shall inherit the earth, and they shall revel over an abundance of peace.

12. [3shall closely watch 1The 2sinner] the just, and shall gnash [2over 3him  1his teeth].

13. But the lord shall laugh out loud at him, for he foresees that [2will come  1his day].

14. [4the broadsword 3unsheathed 1The 2sinners]; they stretched tight their bow  to throw down the poor and needy,  to slay the straight  in heart.

15.  [2their broadsword 1May] enter into  their own hearts; and  [2their bows 1may] be broken.

16. Better is a little to the just, than [2riches 3of sinners 1many].

17. For the arms of sinners shall be broken; [4supports 1but 5the 6just 2the 3 lord].

18. The lord knows the ways of the unblemished; and  their inheritance [2into 3the 4eon 1shall be].

19. They will not be disgraced in [2time 1a bad], and in the days of hunger they shall be filled.

20. For the sinners shall be destroyed. And the enemies of the lord at the same time in their being glorified and exalted, [4vanishing 2as 3smoke 1vanished].

21. [3borrows 1The 2sinner], and does not pay back; but the just pities, and gives.

22. For the ones blessing him shall inherit land; but the ones cursing him shall be utterly destroyed.

23. [5by 6the lord 1The 2footsteps 3of a man 4are straightened out]; and  [2his way 1he shall want] exceedingly.

24. Whenever he shall fall he will not break, for the lord gives support to his hand.

25. [2younger 1I was once] and I grew old; and [3not 1I beheld 2the just] being abandoned, nor  his seed seeking bread loaves.

26. [6the entire  7day 3shows mercy 4and 5lends 1The 2righteous], and  his seed [2for 3a blessing 1will be].

27. Turn aside from evil and do good, and encamp into the eon of the eon!

28. For the lord loves equity, and shall not abandon  his sacred ones; into the eon they shall be guarded. But lawless ones shall be driven out, and the seed of the impious shall be utterly destroyed.

29. But the just shall inherit the earth, and encamp into the eon of the eon upon it.

30. The mouth of the just shall meditate upon wisdom, and  his tongue shall speak equity.

31. The law  of his God is in his heart; and [2shall not 3be tripped up  1his footsteps].

32. [3contemplates 1The 2sinner] the just, and seeks  to kill him.

33. But the lord in no way shall abandon him into  his hands, nor in no way should he condemn him whenever he should judge him.

34. Wait on the lord, and guard  his way! and he shall exalt you  to inherit the land, in the one [3being utterly destroyed 2sinners 1you will see].

35. I beheld the impious being greatly exalted, and being lifted up as the cedars  of Lebanon.

36. And I went by, and behold, he was not. And I sought him, and [2was not 3found  1his place].

37. Guard innocence, and know straightness! for there is a leftover [2man 1for the peaceable].

38. But the lawbreakers shall be utterly destroyed together; the leftovers of the impious shall be utterly destroyed.

39. But deliverance of the just is by the lord; and [3defender 2their 1he is] in time of affliction.

40. And [2shall help 3them 1the lord], and shall rescue them; and he shall take them away from the sinners; and he shall deliver them, for they hoped upon him.  

## Psalms 38

1.  The LORD Sees the Vexed Soul A psalm to David; for remembrance concerning the Sabbath.  O lord, let not  your rage reprove me, nor  your anger correct me!

2. For  your arrows were stuck in me, and [2stayed 3upon 4me  1your hand].

3. There is no healing in  my flesh from the face  of your anger; there is no peace in  my bones from the face  of my sins.

4. For  my lawless deeds are elevated above  my head; as [2load 1a heavy] they were oppressed upon me.

5. [2give out an odor 3and 4fester  1My stripes] from the face  of my folly.

6. I was in misery and bent down until the end. All the day [2looking downcast 1I went].

7. For  my flanks were filled of mockeries, and there is no healing in  my flesh.

8. I was afflicted with evil and humbled, even unto exceedingly. I roared from the moaning  of my heart.

9. O lord, before you is all  my desire; and  my moaning from you can not be concealed.

10.  My heart is disturbed; [2abandoned 3me  1my strength]; even the light  of my eyes, even it is not with me.

11.  My friends and  my neighbors right opposite me approached and stood; and the ones nearest to me [2from 3afar off 1stood].

12. And [4expelled me 1the ones 2seeking  3my life]; and the ones seeking  bad things for me spoke follies; and [2on deceits 3the entire  4day 1they meditated].

13. But I, as a deaf-mute, did not hear; and was as one speechless not opening  his mouth.

14. And I became as a man not hearing, and not having [2in  3his mouth 1rebukes].

15. For upon you, O lord, I hoped. You will hear, O lord  my God.

16. For I spoke, lest at any time [2rejoice over 3me  1my enemies], and at the shaking of my feet [2against 3me 1they spoke great words].

17. For I [2for 3whips 1am prepared], and  my suffering [3before 4me 1is 2always].

18. For  my lawlessness I will announce; and I will be anxious concerning  my sin.

19.  But my enemies live, and are fortified over me; and [5multiply 1the 2ones detesting 3me 4unjustly].

20. The ones recompensing to me bad for good slandered me when they pursued righteousness.

21. You should not abandon me, O lord  my God; you should not separate from me.

22. Take heed for  my help, O lord  of my deliverance!  

## Psalms 39

1.  The LORD Numbers Our Days To the director; to Jeduthun; an ode to David.  I said, I shall guard  my ways  [2to not sin 1for me] with my tongue. I put  [2for my mouth 1a guard] while the [2stood  1sinner] before me.

2. I was mute and humbled and quiet of good words, and  my pain was renewed.

3. [2heated  1My heart] within me; and in  my meditation [2would burn away 1a fire]; I spoke with my tongue.

4. Make known to me, O lord,  my limit! and the number  of my days, what it is, that I should know what I lack.

5. Behold, [2a palm 1you established]  for my days; and my essence is as nothing before you. Furthermore,  [4all things 5are folly 1for every 2man 3living].

6. However, [3with 4an image 2travels 1a man], except, [2in folly 1he is disturbed]. He treasures up, but does not know why he shall gather them.

7. And now, what  of my endurance -- is it not the lord? Even  my support [2from 3you 1is].

8. From all  my lawless deeds rescue me! [3for scorn 4to the fool 1You gave 2me].

9. I was made mute, and I did not open  my mouth, for you did it.

10. Abstain [2from 3me  1your whips]; from the strength  of your hand I failed.

11. With rebukes for lawlessness you corrected man; and [2wastes away 3as 4a spider's  1his life]; besides -- [3is folly 1every 2man]. PAUSE.

12. Hear  my prayer, O lord, and  my supplication! Give ear to  my tears! Be not silent! for [3a sojourner 1I 2am] with you, and an immigrant, as all  my fathers.

13. Spare me! that I shall refresh before  my going forth, and should no longer in any way exist.  

## Psalms 40

1.  Hope is in the Name of The LORD To the director; a psalm to David.  Enduring, I waited on the lord, and he took heed to me, and he heard  my supplication.

2. And he led me from out of the pit of misery, and from the mud of slime. And he stood [2upon 3the rock  1my feet], and straightened out  my footsteps.

3. And he put into  my mouth [2song 1a new], a hymn to our God. [2shall see 1Many], and shall fear, and shall hope upon the lord.

4. Blessed is the man of which [2is 3in the 4name 5of the lord 1his hope], and did not look to follies and [2frenzies 1false].

5. Many things you did yourself, O lord  my God, concerning your wonders; and concerning your devices there is not any that shall be likened to you. I reported and spoke -- they were multiplied above number.

6. A sacrifice and offering you wanted not, but a body you readied to me; whole burnt-offerings and a sacrifice for sin you did not seek.

7. Then I said, Behold, I come. In the chapter of the scroll it is written concerning me.

8.  To do  your will, O my God I wanted; and  your law is in the midst  of my belly.

9. I announced good news -- righteousness in [2assembly 1the great]. Behold,  [3my lips 1in no way 2should I restrain], O lord, you know.

10.  My righteousness I hid not in  my heart;  your truth and  your deliverance I told; I hid not  your mercy and  your truth from the gathering of many.

11. But you, O lord, [2should not be 3far  1your compassions] from me.  Your mercy and  your truth, [2always 1may they] take hold of me.

12. For [2compass 3me 1bad things] which there is no number. [2overtook 3me  1My lawless deeds], and I was not able  to see. They were multiplied over the hairs  of my head; and  my heart abandoned me.

13. Think well, O lord,  to rescue me! O lord, [2to  3help 4me 1take heed]!

14. May [5be disgraced 6and 7feel shame 8together 1the ones 2seeking  3my life  4to lift it away]. May they be turned back to the rear, and may [4feel shame 1the ones 2wanting 3bad things for me].

15. Let them carry immediately their shame -- the ones saying to me, Well done. well done.

16. [5exult 6and 7are glad 8over 9you 1All 2the ones 3seeking 4you], O lord. And let [5say 4always 6let the lord be magnified 1the ones 2loving  3your deliverance]!

17. But I am poor and needy; the lord will be thoughtful of me. [2my helper 3and 4my defender 1You are], O my God, you should not delay.  

## Psalms 41

1.  The LORD Helps the Righteous To the director; a psalm to David.  Blessed is the one taking notice upon the poor and needy; [5in 7day 6the evil 3shall rescue 4him 1the 2 lord].

2. May the lord guard him, and enliven him, and bless him in the land; and may he not deliver him into the hands of his enemies.

3. Let the lord help him upon the bed of his grief! [2all  3of his bed 1You turned] in  his illness.

4. I said, O lord, show mercy on me! Heal  my soul! for I sinned against you.

5.  My enemies said bad things against me, saying, When shall he die and [2perish  1his name]?

6. And if he entered  to see me, [3folly 2spoke  1his heart]. He gathered lawlessness to himself; he went forth outside and spoke in the same manner.

7. [4against 5me 3whispered 1All  2my enemies]; against me they devised bad things for me.

8. [5matter 4an illegal 1They laid down 2against 3me], saying, Shall the one going to bed not proceed  to rise up?

9. For also the man  of my peace upon whom I hoped, the one eating my bread loaves, magnified against me with trickery.

10. But you, O lord, show mercy on me, and raise me up, and recompense to them!

11. By this I knew that you wanted me, that in no way should [2rejoice  1my enemy] over me.

12. [3my 1But 2because of]  innocence you assisted and firmed me up before you into the eon.

13. Blessed be the lord  God of Israel, from the eon and into the eon. May it be, May it be.  

## Psalms 42

1.  The Disturbed Soul Thirsts for God To the director; for contemplation to the sons of Korah.  In which manner [3longs 1the 2stag] after the springs of the waters, so [2longs  1my soul] after you, O God.

2. [2thirsted  1My soul] for  [4God 1the 2mighty  3living]. When shall I come and appear  in front  of God?

3. [2became  1My tears] bread for me day and night, while  saying to me each day, Where is  your God?

4. These things I remembered, and [2poured out 3upon 4me  1my soul], for I shall go through to the place [2tent 1of the wonderful], unto the house  of God, with a voice of exultation, and acknowledgment of the sound of the solemnizing a holiday.

5. Why are you dejected, O my soul? and why do you disturb me? Hope upon  God! for I shall acknowledge to him the deliverance  of my person.

6. O my God, to myself  my soul was disturbed; on account of this I will remember you from the land of Jordan, and Hermons, from [2mountain 1the small].

7. The deep [2the deep 1calls] at the sound  of your torrents; all  your crests and  your waves [2over 3me 1went].

8. By day the lord gives charge to  his mercy, and at night his ode shall be with me -- a prayer to the God  of my life.

9. I will say  to God, [2shielder 1You are my]; why did you forget me? Why [2looking downcast 1do I go] at the squeezing by the enemy?

10. In the breaking in pieces  of my bones, [4berated 5me 1the ones 2afflicting 3me]; while  in their saying to me accordingly each day, Where is  your God?

11. Why are you dejected, O my soul? and why do you disturb me? Hope upon  God! for I shall acknowledge to him the deliverance  of my person, and  my God.  

## Psalms 43

1.  Acknowledge God with the Heart A psalm to David.  Judge for me, O God, and adjudicate  my cause, from a nation which is not sacred! [3from 4a man 5unjust 6and 7deceitful 1rescue 2me]!

2. For you are the God of my fortification. Why did you thrust me away? And why [2looking downcast 1do I go] during the squeezing by the enemy?

3. Send out  your light, and  your truth! they guided me, and they led me to [2mountain 1your holy], and to  your tents.

4. And I shall enter to the altar  of God; to the God  gladdening  my youth. I will acknowledge to you with the harp, O God  my God.

5. Why are you dejected, O my soul? and why disturb me? Hope upon  God! for I shall make acknowledgment to him, the deliverance  of my person, and  my God.  

## Psalms 44

1.  God is Our Deliverer To the director; to the sons of Korah; for contemplation.  O God, [2with  3our ears 1we heard], and  our fathers announced to us the work which you worked in  their days, in [2days 1ancient].

2.  Your hand [2nations 1utterly destroyed], and planted them. You afflicted peoples and cast them out.

3. For not by  their broadsword they inherited the land, and  their arm did not deliver them; but it was  your right hand, and  your arm, and the illumination  of your countenance, for you thought well by them.

4. You are he, O my king and  my God, the one giving charge to the deliverances of Jacob.

5. In you  [2our enemies 1we will gore], and in  your name we will treat with contempt the ones rising up against us.

6. For not upon  my bow will I hope; and  my broadsword will not deliver me.

7. For he delivered us from the ones afflicting us; and the ones detesting us he disgraced.

8. In  God we will be praised the entire  day; and in  your name we will make acknowledgment into the eon.

9. But now you thrusted away, and disgraced us; and you shall not go forth, O God, with  our forces.

10. You turned us to the rear by  our enemies; and the ones detesting us plundered for themselves.

11. You gave us as sheep for food; and among the nations you scattered us.

12. You rendered  your people without a value; and there was no abundance by  their shout.

13. You put us for scorn to our neighbors; for a sneering and a taunting to the ones round about us.

14. You put us as a parable among the nations; a shaking of the head among the peoples.

15. [5the entire  6day  1My being made ashamed 3in front 4of me 2is], and the shame  of my face covered me;

16. even from the voice of the one berating and speaking improperly from in front of the enemy and the one banishing.

17. All these things came upon us, but we did not forget you; and we did not do wrong by your covenant;

18. and we did not leave [2to 3the 4rear  1our heart], nor turned aside  our paths from  your way.

19. For you humbled us in the place of affliction; and [3covered over 4us 1the shadow 2of death].

20. If we forgot the name  of our God, and if we opened and spread out our hands to [2god 1an alien],

21. shall not  God require these things? For he knows the secret things of the heart.

22. For because of you we are being put to death the entire  day; we are considered as sheep for slaughter.

23. Awaken! Why do you sleep, O lord? Rise up! and you should not thrust us away unto the end.

24. Why  [3your face 1do you 2turn] and forget  our poorness and  our affliction?

25. For [2was humbled 3into 4the dust  1our soul]; [2was cleaved 3to 4the earth  1our belly].

26. Rise up, O lord, help us and ransom us because of  your name!  

## Psalms 45

1.  The Beauty of the Warrior To the director; for the changings; to the sons of Korah; for contemplation; an ode for the beloved.  [2discharged forth  1My heart 4word 3a good]. I speak  of my works to the king.  My tongue is a reed pen of a scribe writing fast.

2. More beautiful in beauty than the sons  of men. [2was poured out 1Favor] on your lips. On account of this [2blessed 3you  1God] into the eon.

3. Gird  your broadsword upon  your thigh! O mighty one, in your beauty.

4. And in your fineness, even stretch tight your bow, and greatly prosper, and reign! Because of truth, and gentleness, and righteousness even shall [2guide 3you 4wonderfully  1your right hand].

5.  Your arrows are being sharpened, O mighty one. Peoples [2underneath 3you 1shall fall] in the heart of the enemies of the king.

6.  Your throne, O God, is unto the eon of the eon. A rod of straightness is the rod  of your kingdom.

7. You loved righteousness, and detested lawlessness; on account of this [3anointed 4you  1God  2your God] with oil of exultation beyond  your fellow partakers.

8. Myrrh, and balsam, and cassia of  your garments from palaces of ivory,

9. from of which [3gladdened 4you 1the daughters 2of kings] in  your honor. [3stood 1The 2queen] at your right [2in 3clothes 5interwoven with gold 1having put around 4being embroidered].

10. Hear, O daughter, and behold! And lean  your ear, and forget  your people, and the house  of your father!

11. Even [3desired 1the 2king]  your beauty; for he is your lord, and you shall do obeisance to him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre shall come with gifts.  [6your face 5will implore 1The 2rich 3of the 4people].

13. All the glory of the daughter of the king within, with bordered fringes of gold,

14. being put around, being embroidered. [2shall be carried 3to the 4king 1The virgins] after her; the ones near her shall be carried to you.

15. They shall be carried in gladness and exultation; they shall be led into the temple of the king.

16. In place of  your fathers, [2were born  1your sons]. You shall place them as rulers over all the earth.

17. I will make [2remembered  1your name] in every generation, and generation. On account of this peoples will make acknowledgment to you into the eon, and into the eon of the eon.  

## Psalms 46

1.  The LORD is a Helper in Our Afflictions To the director; for the sons of Korah; [2concerning 3the 4secrets 1a psalm].   Our God is a refuge and power; a helper in afflictions, to the ones [2having found 3us 1exceedingly].

2. On account of this we shall not fear when the [2is disturbed  1earth], and [2are transposed 1mountains] in the hearts of seas.

3. [2sounded 3and 4were disturbed  1Their waters]; [3were disturbed 1the 2mountains] by  his force.

4. [3of the 4river 1The 2rapid movements] gladdens the city  of God. [3sanctified  4his tent 1The 2highest].

5.  God is in the midst of her, and she shall not be shaken. [2shall help 3her  1God]  towards morning by morning.

6. [2were disturbed 1Nations]; [2leaned 1kingdoms]; [3gave out 4his voice 1the 2highest], [3shook 1the 2earth].

7. The lord of the forces is with us; [4is our shielder 1the 2God 3of Jacob].

8. Come and see the works  of God! what [2he made 1miracles] upon the earth.

9. Taking away [2in return 1wars] unto the ends of the earth. [2the bow 1He shall break], and he shall break in pieces the weapon; and the shields he shall incinerate with fire.

10. Relax, and know that I am  God! I shall be raised up high in the nations. I shall be raised up high in the earth.

11. The lord of the forces is with us; [4is our shielder 1the 2God 3of Jacob].  

## Psalms 47

1.  The LORD is the Great King Over the Earth For the director; [2for 3the 4sons 5of Korah 1a psalm].  All the nations -- clap hands! Shout  to God with a voice of exultation!

2. For the lord the highest is dreadful; [2king 1a great] over all the earth.

3. He submitted peoples to us, and nations under  our feet.

4. He chose to us the inheritance for us, the beauty of Jacob whom he loved.

5. God ascended in a shout; the lord with the sound of a trumpet.

6. Strum to our God! Strum! Strum to our king! Strum!

7. For the king of all the earth  is God. Strum expertly!

8. God reigns over the nations.  God sits upon [2throne 1his holy].

9. Rulers of peoples are brought together with the God of Abraham. For  by God the strong ones of the earth [2exceedingly 1were lifted up].  

## Psalms 48

1.  Mount Zion the City of the Great King A psalm; an ode to the sons of Korah; second Sabbath.  Great is the lord, and [2praiseworthy 1exceedingly] in the city  of our God, in [2mountain 1his holy].

2. With good root, a leap for joy of all the earth -- mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the [2king  1great].

3.  God [2in  3her palaces 1is known], whenever he should assist her.

4. For behold, the kings of the earth are being brought together; they went through together.

5. They in seeing thus wondered; they were disturbed; they were shaken.

6. Trembling took hold of them there -- pangs as a woman giving birth.

7. By [2wind 1a violent] you shall break the boats of Tarshish.

8. Just as we heard, so also we behold in the city of the lord of the forces, in the city  of our God.  God founded it into the eon.

9. We undertook, O God,  of your mercy in the midst  of your people.

10. According to  your name, O God, so also is the praise of you unto the ends of the earth. [3of righteousness 2is full  1Your right hand].

11. Be glad,  mount Zion! and exult  daughters  of Judea! because of  your judgments, O lord.

12. Encircle Zion, and take hold of her! Describe concerning  her towers!

13. Put  your hearts for  her force! and share about  her palaces! so that you may describe to [2generation 1another].

14. For this is  our God into the eon, and into the eon of the eon; he shall tend us into the eons.  

## Psalms 49

1.  God shall Ransom my Soul To the director; [2to the 3sons 4of Korah 1a psalm].  Hear these things all  nations! Give ear all the ones dwelling in the inhabitable world --

2. both the earth-born, and the sons  of men together, rich and needy!

3.  My mouth speaks wisdom, and the meditation  of my heart understanding.

4. I will lean [2to 3a parable  1my ear]; I will open [2with 3a psaltery  1my riddle].

5. Why do I fear in [2day 1the wicked]? The lawlessness  at my heel shall encircle me --

6. the ones yielding upon  their power, even [2upon 3the 4multitude  5of their riches 1the ones boasting].

7. A brother does not ransom. Shall [2ransom 1a man]? He shall not give to God an appeasement for himself.

8. (Even the value of the ransoming  his soul, even if he labored into the eon.)

9. And he shall live till the end, for he should not see corruption.

10. Whenever he should behold wise men dying, [5together 1the fool 2and 3the mindless one 4shall perish]; and they shall leave behind [2to strangers  1their riches].

11. And  their tombs are their houses into the eon, and their tents unto generation and generation. They call  [3their names 2after  1lands].

12. And a man [2in 3honor 1being] perceived not; he resembles the [2cattle  1unthinking], and is like them.

13. This  their way is an obstacle to them; yet after these things [2with  3their mouths 1they take pleasure].

14. [2as 3sheep 4in 5Hades 1They placed them]; death tends them; and [3shall dominate 4them 1the 2upright] in the morning; and  their help shall grow old in  Hades; [2from  3their glory 1they were banished].

15. Except  God shall ransom  my soul from out of the hand of Hades, whenever he should take me.

16. Do not fear whenever [2should be enriched 1a man], or whenever [4should be multiplied 1the 2glory  3of his house],

17. for [2not 5in  6his dying 1he shall 3take  4anything], nor will [2go down with 3him  1his glory]!

18. For  his soul [2in  3his life 1shall be blessed]. He shall make acknowledgment to you whenever you should do good to him.

19. He shall enter unto the generation of his fathers; unto the eon he shall not see light.

20. And a man [2in 3honor 1being] perceived not; he resembles the [2cattle  1unthinking] and is like them.  

## Psalms 50

1.  The Earth is The LORD's A psalm to Asaph.  The God of gods, the lord spoke, and called the earth from the east sun unto its descent.

2. From out of Zion is the attractiveness  of his beauty.

3.  God visibly shall come,  our God, and he will not remain silent. A fire before him shall burn; and round about him [2gale 1an exceeding].

4. He shall call on the heaven upward, and the earth, to separate  his people.

5. Gathered to him  are his sacred ones, the ones ordaining  his covenant with sacrifices.

6. And [3shall announce 1the 2heavens]  his righteousness; for  God is judge.

7. Hear, O my people! and I will speak to you O Israel, and I will testify to you. The God,  [2your God 1I am].

8. [2not 5over  6your sacrifices 1I will 3reprove 4you];  for your whole burnt-offerings [3before 4me 1are 2always].

9. I will not take [2from  3your house 1calves], nor [2from  3your flocks 1winter yearlings].

10. For [3mine 1it is 2all] -- the wild beasts of the field, the cattle on the mountains, and oxen.

11. I know all the winged creatures of the heaven; and the beauty of the field [2with 3me 1is].

12. If I should hunger, in no way should I tell you, [5mine 1for 4is 2the 3inhabitable world], and the fullness of it.

13. Shall I eat meats of bulls or [2blood 3of he-goats 1drink]?

14. Sacrifice  to God a sacrifice of praise! and render to the highest  your vows!

15. And call upon me in the day of affliction! and I shall rescue you, and you shall glorify me.

16. But to the sinner God said, Why do you describe  my ordinances, and take up  my covenant through your mouth?

17. For you detested instruction, and cast out  my words to the rear.

18. Since you viewed a thief, you ran together with him; and [3with 4the adulterer  2your portion 1you established].

19.  Your mouth abounded with evil, and  your tongue twisted with deceits.

20. In sitting down, [2against  3your brother 1you spoke ill]; even [3against 4the 5son  6of your mother 1to place 2an obstacle].

21. These things you did, and I kept quiet. You undertook lawlessness, for you thought I will be likened to you. I will reprove you, and I will stand [2in front of 3your face  1your sins].

22. Perceive indeed these things, O ones forgetting  God! lest at any time he should snatch you away, and in no way should there be one rescuing.

23. A sacrifice of praise shall glorify me, and there in the way  I will show to him  my deliverance.  

## Psalms 51

1.  God Cleanses Us from Sin To the director; a psalm to David in  [4entering 5to 6him 1Nathan 2the 3prophet], when he entered to Bathsheba the wife of Uriah.  Show mercy on me, O God, according to  [2great 3mercy 1your], and according to the multitude  of your compassions! Wipe away  my violation of the law!

2.  Abundantly wash me from  my lawlessness, and [3from  4my sin 1cleanse 2me]!

3. For  [3my lawlessness 1I 2know], and  my sin [3before 4me 1is 2always].

4. Against you alone I sinned, and [2the 3wicked thing 4before 5you 1did]; that you should be justified in  your words, and should overcome in  your judging.

5. For behold in lawless deeds I was conceived, and in sins [2craved strange food 3for me  1my mother].

6. For behold, [2truth 1you loved]. [3the 4concealed things 5and 6the 7private things  8of your wisdom 1You manifested 2to me].

7. You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; you shall wash me and [2above 3snow 1I shall be whitened].

8. You shall cause me to hear exultation and gladness; [3shall exult 1the bones 2being humbled].

9. Turn  your face from  my sins, and [2all  3my lawlessnesses 1wipe away]!

10. [5heart 4a clean 1Create 2in 3me], O God, and [3spirit 2an upright 1renew] in  my insides!

11. Do not reel [2from me  1your face]; and  [5spirit 3the 4holy 1do not 2take away in return] from me!

12. Give back to me the exultation  of your deliverance, and [4spirit 3with your governing 1support 2me]!

13. I shall teach the lawless ones  your ways, and the impious [2to 3you 1shall turn].

14. Rescue me from blood guilt, O God, the God  of my deliverance! [2shall exult over  1My tongue]  your righteousness.

15. O lord,  [2my lips 1you shall open], and  my mouth shall announce  your praise.

16. For if you wanted a sacrifice, I would have given; whole burnt-offerings you do not think well of.

17. A sacrifice  to God is a spirit being broken; [4a heart 5being broken 6and 7humbled  1God 2will not 3treat with contempt].

18. Do good, O lord, by  your benevolence  to Zion, and let [4be built 1the 2walls 3of Jerusalem]!

19. Then you will think well of a sacrifice of righteousness offering, and whole burnt-offerings; then they shall offer [2upon  3your altar 1calves].  

## Psalms 52

1.  God Demolishes the Deceitful To the director; for contemplation; to David, in the coming of Doeg the Edomite, and announcing  to Saul, and telling to him that David went to the house of Ahimelech.  Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man, with lawlessness the entire  day?

2. [3injustice 2considers  1Your tongue]; as [2a razor 1sharpening] you did treachery.

3. You loved evil over goodness; injustice over  speaking righteousness.

4. You loved all the [2words 1drowning], [2tongue 1O deceitful].

5. On account of this,  God shall demolish you unto the end, to pluck you out, and to migrate you from your tent, and  your root from out of the land of the living.

6. [2shall see 1The just] and shall fear, and [2at 3him 1shall laugh]. And they shall say,

7. Behold, the man who did not make  God his helper, but raised hope upon the multitude  of his riches, and was strengthened by  his folly.

8. But I am as [2olive tree 1a fruitful] in the house  of God. I hoped upon the mercy  of God into the eon, and into the eon of the eon.

9. I will make acknowledgment to you into the eon, for you acted; and I will wait on  your name, for you are gracious before  your sacred ones.  

## Psalms 53

1.  There is Not One Doing Good To the director; a psalm for [2upon the harp, 1contemplation]; to David.  [2said 1The fool] in his heart, There is no God. They were corrupt and abhorrent in lawless deeds. There is not one doing good.

2.  God from out of the heaven looks upon the sons  of men,  to behold if there is one perceiving or seeking after  God.

3. All turned aside; together they were made useless; there is not one doing good, there is not even one.

4. Shall [5not 6know 1all 2the ones 3working  4lawlessness], the ones eating up  my people for solid food of bread?  [3the lord 1They did not 2call upon].

5. There they feared a fear, where there was no fear; for  God dispersed the bones of ones trying to please men. They were disgraced, for  God treated them with contempt.

6. Who will appoint from out of Zion  deliverance  for Israel? In  God returning the captivity  of his people, Jacob shall exult and Israel shall be glad.  

## Psalms 54

1.  God Helps Me To the director; among the hymns of contemplation to David; in the coming of the Ziphites, and their saying  to Saul, Behold is not David hidden with us?  O God, by  your name deliver me, and by  your power judge me!

2. O God, listen to  my prayer, give ear to the words  of my mouth!

3. For strangers rose up against me; and strong men seek  my life; and they did not set  God before them.

4. For behold  God helps me; and the lord is a shielder  of my life.

5. He shall return the evils to my enemies. By  your truth utterly destroy them!

6. Voluntarily I will sacrifice to you; I will make acknowledgment to your name, O lord, for good.

7. For from out of all afflictions you rescued me; and among  my enemies [2looked upon its request  1my eye].  

## Psalms 55

1.  Betrayal by a Friend To the director; among hymns of contemplation; to Asaph.  Give ear, O God, to my prayer! for you should not overlook  my supplication.

2. Take heed to me, and listen to me! I was fretted in  my meditation and was disturbed,

3. from the voice of the enemy, and from the affliction of the sinner; for they turned aside against me for lawlessness, and in anger they displayed anger against me.

4.  My heart was disturbed in me, and dread of death fell upon me.

5. Fear and trembling came upon me, and [2covered 3me 1darkness].

6. And I said, Why shall he not give to me wings as a dove, and I shall spread out and I shall rest?

7. Behold, I was far off being driven into exile, and was lodged in the wilderness.

8. I waited for the one delivering me from faint-heartedness and the gale.

9. Sink them, O lord, and divide  their tongues! for I saw lawlessness and dispute in the city.

10. Day and night he shall encircle her upon  her walls; and lawlessness and misery will be in the midst of her;

11. and injustice, and [4ceased not 5from out of  6her squares 1usury 2and 3treachery].

12. For if an enemy berated me, I would have endured. And if the one detesting me [2against 3me 1spoke great words], I would have hidden from him.

13. But you, O man, are like-minded, a leader of mine, and my diviner,

14. who together you sweetened foods; in the house  of God we went in concord.

15. And let [2come 1death] upon them, and let them go down into Hades alive! For wickedness in  their sojourn, is in the midst of them.

16. I [2to  3God 1cried out], and the lord listened to me.

17. Evening and morning and at midday I describe and report; and he shall listen to  my voice.

18. He shall ransom [2in 3peace  1my soul] from the ones approaching me; for among many they were with me.

19. God shall listen, and [6shall humble 7them 1the one 2existing 3before 4the 5eons]. PAUSE. [3no 1For 2there is 5with them 4bargaining], for they do not fear  God.

20. He stretched out  his hand in  recompensing; they profaned  his covenant.

21. He divided them into parts from the anger  of his face, and [2approached  1their hearts]. [2were made tender  1His words] above olive oil, yet they are arrows.

22. Cast upon the lord  your anxiety, and he will nourish you! He will not grant [4into 5the 6eon 3for a tossing about 1the 2just].

23. But you, O God, shall lead them down into the well of corruption; men of blood and deceit in no way shall live half  their days. But I, O lord, shall hope upon you.  

## Psalms 56

1.  David is Afflicted by War To the director; for the people  [2from 3the 4holy things 1being far]; to David; for an inscription on a monument; when [3held 4him 1the 2Philistines] in Gath.  Show mercy on me, O God! for [2trampled 3me 1man]. The entire  day in waging war he afflicted me.

2. [2trampled 3me  1My enemies] the entire  day, for many are the ones waging war against me from the height.

3. [3the day 1I do not 2fear], and I shall hope upon you.

4. In  God I will praise  by my words. Upon  God I hoped. I shall not fear what [2shall do 3to me 1flesh].

5. The entire  day  [2my words 1they abhorred]; [3are against 4me 1all  2their thoughts] for bad.

6. They will sojourn and hide; they  [2my heel 1will guard], just as they wait  for my life.

7. For  by no means will you deliver them; [3in 4anger 2peoples 1you will lead down].

8. O God,  my life I declared to you; you put  my tears before you, as even according to  your promise.

9. [2shall turn  1My enemies] to the rear, in which ever day I should call upon you. Behold, I knew that [2my God 1you are].

10. Unto  God I will praise by discourse; unto the lord I will praise by word.

11. Unto  God I hoped; I will not be afraid in what [2shall do 3to me 1man].

12. In me, O God, are the vows which I shall give of your praise.

13. For you rescued  my soul from death,  my eyes from tears, and  my feet from a slip. I shall be well-pleasing before the lord in the light of the living.  

## Psalms 57

1.  The LORD Rescues To the director; do not utterly destroy; to David; for an inscription on a monument; in  his running away from the face of Saul into the cave.  Show mercy on me, O God, show mercy on me! For [3upon 4you 2yielded  1my soul]. And in the shadow  of your wings I shall hope, until of which time [2should go by  1lawlessness].

2. I shall cry out to  God the highest; the God  benefiting me.

3. He sent out from heaven, and he delivered me. He put [4unto 5scorn 1the ones 2trampling 3me]. [2sent out  1God]  his mercy and  his truth;

4. and he rescued  my soul from the midst of lion cubs. I went to bed being disturbed; the sons of men --  their teeth are weapons and arrows, and  their tongue [2sword 1a sharp].

5. Be raised up high above the heavens, O God, and [2above 3all 4the 5earth  1your glory]!

6. [2a snare 1They prepared] for my feet, and bent down  my soul. They dug [2before 3my face 1a cesspool], and they fell into it. PAUSE.

7. [2is prepared  1My heart], O God, [2is prepared  1my heart]. I will sing and I will strum in  my glory.

8. Awaken,  my glory! Awaken, O psaltery and harp! I shall awaken at dawn.

9. I will make acknowledgment to you among peoples, O lord, I will strum to you among nations.

10. For [2was magnified 3unto 4the 5heavens  1your mercy]; and [2unto 3the 4clouds  1your truth].

11. Be raised up high above the heavens, O God, and [2above 3all 4the 5earth  1your glory]!  

## Psalms 58

1.  Contempt for Sinners To the director; do not utterly destroy; to David; for an inscription on a monument.  Will truly thus [2righteousness 1you speak] and rightly judge, O sons  of men?

2. For even in the heart [2lawlessness 1you work] in the earth. [3in injustice  1Your hands 2closely join].

3. [2were separated  1Sinners] from the womb; they wander from the belly; they spoke lies.

4. Rage to them is according to the likeness of the serpent; as [2asp 1a mute] even plugging  her ears,

5. who does not listen to the sound [2charming 1of the sorcerer], and the administering of potions by a wise man.

6.  God broke  their teeth in  their mouths; [4the 5molars 6of the 7lions 3fractured in pieces 1the 2 lord].

7. They shall be treated with contempt as water going by. He shall stretch tight  his bow until of which time they shall be weakened.

8. As beeswax melting away, they shall be taken away in return. [2fell 1Fire] upon them, and they did not see the sun.

9. Before the perceiving  of your thorn-bushes -- the white-thorn shrub; as living, as in anger he shall swallow them.

10. [2shall be glad 1The just one] whenever he should behold punishment.  [2his hands 1He shall wash] in the blood of the sinner.

11. And [2shall say 1a man],  There is fruit to the just; there is  God judging them in the earth.  

## Psalms 59

1.  The LORD is My Shielder To the director; do not corrupt; to David; for an inscription on a monument; when Saul sent and guarded  his house  to kill him.  Rescue me from  my enemies, O God, and [3from 4the ones 5rising up 6against 7me 1ransom 2me]!

2. Rescue me from the ones working  lawlessness, and [3from 4men 5of blood 1deliver 2me]!

3. For behold, they hunted  my life; [2put 3upon 4me 1strong ones]; nor is it because of  my lawlessness nor  my sin, O lord.

4. Without lawlessness I ran and straightened out. Awake to meet me, and see!

5. And you, O lord, the God of the forces,  God  of Israel, take heed  to visit all the nations! You should not pity any of the ones practicing  lawlessness.

6. They shall return at evening, and shall be famished as a dog, and shall circle the city.

7. Behold, they shall declare with  their mouths; and the broadsword is in  their lips; for they say, Who hears?

8. And you, O lord, shall laugh out loud at them; you shall treat with contempt all the nations.

9.  My might to you I will keep, for you, O God, [2shielder 1are my].

10.  My God,  his mercy shall go beforehand with me.  My God shall show to me my desire on  my enemies.

11. You should not kill them, lest at any time they should forget  your law. Disperse them by  your power, and lead them down,  [2my defender 1O lord]!

12. For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips, even let them be seized in  their pride! even for cursing and lying which they shall declare.

13. In consummation, by anger of consummation consume, that in no way they should exist; that they shall know that  God is master  of Jacob, and of the ends of the earth. PAUSE.

14. They shall return at evening, and be famished as a dog, and shall circle the city.

15. They shall be dispersed  to eat, but if they should not be filled, then they shall grumble.

16. But I shall sing to your power, and I shall exult in the morning  of your mercy; for you became my shielder and my refuge in the day of my affliction.

17. [2my helper 1You are], to you I shall strum; for you, O God, [2shielder 1are my],  my God  of my mercy.  

## Psalms 60

1.  God Helps Those in Affliction To the director; for the changings; for an inscription on a monument; to David; for teaching when he set on fire  Mesopotamia of Syria, and  Syria Zobah; and Joab returned and struck  Edom in the ravine  of salts -- twelve thousand.  O God, you thrusted us away, and demolished us. You were provoked to anger, yet you pitied us.

2. You shook the earth, and disturbed it. Heal  its breaks! for it was shaken.

3. You showed to your people hard things; you watered us down with the wine of vexation.

4. You gave to the ones fearing you a signal  to flee from the face of the bow. PAUSE.

5. So that [2should be rescued  1your beloved]. Deliver with your hand, and heed me!

6.  God spoke in  his holy place; I will exult, and I will divide Shechem, and the valley of the tents I will measure out.

7. [2is mine 1Gilead], and [2is mine 1Manasseh], and Ephraim is the fortification  of my head; Judah is my king;

8. Moab is a kettle  of my hope; over  Edom I will stretch out  my sandal. [3to me 1The Philistines 2submitted].

9. Who shall take me away into the city citadel? Or who shall guide me unto  Edom?

10. Will not you, O God, the one thrusting us away? And will you not go forth, O God, with  our forces?

11. Give to us help from affliction! for [3is vain 1deliverance 2of man].

12. In  God we do powerfully, and he shall treat with contempt the ones afflicting us.  

## Psalms 61

1.  Fear God and Abide unto the Eon To the director; among the hymns to David; a psalm.  Listen, O God, to my supplication! Take heed to my prayer!

2. From the ends of the earth [2to 3you 1I cry out]. In the discouraging  of my heart, [2in 3the rock 1you lifted me high]; you guided me.

3. For you became my hope; the tower of strength from in front of an enemy.

4. I will sojourn in  your tent into the eons; I shall be sheltered in the protection  of your wings.

5. For you, O God, listened to  my vows. You gave an inheritance to the ones fearing  your name.

6. Days upon days of the king; you shall add  of his years unto days of generations and generations.

7. He shall abide into the eon before  God. [4mercy 5and 6truth 3his 1Who 2will seek]?

8. Thus I shall strum to your name into the eons,  for me to render  my vows day by day.  

## Psalms 62

1.  God is Our Deliverance To the director; for Jeduthun; a psalm to David.  Shall not [3to 4God 2be submitted  1my soul], [3is by 4him 1for  2my deliverance]?

2. For even he is my God, and my deliverer, my shielder. In no way should I be shaken by many.

3. For how long do you put upon a man? [3slaughter 2all 1You] as a wall leaning and a fence thrusting through.

4. But  [3my honor 1they consulted 2to thrust away]. I ran in thirst; with their mouth blessing, but in their heart they cursed.

5. But [2to 3God 1be submitted], O my soul! for [2is by 3him  1my endurance].

6. For he is my God, and my deliverer, my shielder; for in no way should I migrate.

7. By  God  is my deliverance, and  my glory; the God  of my help; and  my hope is upon  God.

8. Hope upon him, all you gathering people! pour out before him  your hearts! for  God is our helper. PAUSE.

9. But [4are vain 1the 2sons  3of men]; [4are false weights 1the 2sons  3of men] in the yoke balance scales  to do wrong. They are of folly all together.

10. Hope not upon unrighteousness, and [2after 3a thing seized 1long not]! If wealth should flow, set not the heart upon it!

11. Once God spoke, and these two things I heard; that  might  is of God,

12. and of you, O lord,  is mercy. For you recompense each according to  his works.  

## Psalms 63

1.  God is Worthy of Praise A psalm to David; in  his being in the wilderness  of Judah.  O God,  my God, to you I rise early. [2thirsted for 3you  1My soul]. How often [2longed for you  1my flesh] in [6land 1a barren 2and 3untrodden 4and 5waterless].

2. Thus in the holy place I appeared to you,  to behold  your power and  your glory.

3. For [2is better  1your mercy] than life.  My lips shall praise you;

4. thus will I bless you in  my life; [3in  4your name 1I will lift  2my hands].

5. As of fat and fatness may [2be filled  1my soul]; and with lips of exultation [2shall praise  1my mouth].

6. Forasmuch as I remembered you upon  my strewn bed; at the dawns I meditated on you.

7. For you are my helper, and in the protection  of your wings I shall exult.

8. [2shall cleave  1My soul] after you; [4of me 1but 3took hold  2your right hand].

9. But they [3in 4folly 1seek  2my soul]; they shall enter into the lowermost part of the earth.

10. They shall be delivered up into the hands of the broadsword; [2portions 3for foxes 1they will be].

11. But the king shall be glad upon  God; [5shall be praised 1all  2swearing by an oath 3in 4him], for he obstructed the mouth of the ones speaking unjustly.

2. Shelter me from the conspiracy of the ones acting wickedly! from the multitude of the ones working iniquity.

3. The ones who sharpened [2as 3a broadsword  1their tongues]; they stretched tight their bow [2thing 1for a bitter];

4.  to shoot in concealed places at the unblemished; suddenly they will shoot him, and they will not fear.

5. They determined for themselves [2matter 1an evil]; they describe to themselves  how to hide snares. They said, Who shall see them?

6. They searched out lawlessness; they failed while searching out in the search. [2shall come forward 1Man] and the heart is deep,

7. and God shall be exalted; the arrow of infants became  their calamities;

8. and [2treated him with contempt  1their tongues]. [5were disturbed 1All 2the ones 3viewing 4them];

9. and [3was fearful 1every 2man]. And they announced the works  of God, and  [2his actions 1they perceived].

10. [2shall be glad 1The just] in the lord, and shall hope upon him; and [5shall be praised 1all 2the 3straight  4in heart].

3. [2words 1Lawless] overpowered us; but  [3our impieties 1you 2shall atone].

4. Blessed is whom you chose, and took to yourself; he shall encamp in  your courtyards. We shall be filled in the good things  of your house, [2holy  3temple 1your].

5. Wonderful in righteousness -- heed us, O God  our deliverer!  He is the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of the ones in the sea afar;

6. preparing mountains in  his strength, being girded in dominion;

7. the one disturbing the extent of the sea -- at the sounds of its waves who shall stand?

8. [3shall be disturbed 1The 2nations], and [5shall fear 1the ones 2dwelling at 3the 4ends] from  your signs. The exitings of the morning and evening you shall make happy.

9. You visited the earth, and you intoxicated it. You multiplied  to enrich it. The river  of God is filled with waters. You prepared  their nourishment, for thus is its preparation.

10.  [2her furrows 1Saturate]! Multiply  her produce! By  her drops the produce shall be glad while rising.

11. You shall bless the crown of the year, because of your graciousness; and  your plains shall be filled in fatness.

12. [6shall be fattened 1The 2beautiful 3mountains 4of the 5wilderness]; and [4in exultation 1the 2hills 3shall gird themselves].

13. [5shall put on wool 1The 2rams 3of the 4sheep], and the valleys shall multiply grain. They shall cry out, for even they will sing praise.

5. Come and see the works  of God! as fearful in counsels above the sons  of men.

6. The one converting the sea into dry land; in the river they shall go through on foot. There we shall be glad in him --

7. to the one being master in  his domination of the eon.  His eyes [2upon 3the 4nations 1look]. [2the ones 3greatly embittering him 1Let not] raise [2up high  1themselves]! PAUSE.

8. Bless, O nations,  our God! And cause [4to be heard 1the 2voice  3of his praise]!

9. Even of the one who establishes  my soul for life, and not granting [2for 3tossing about  1my feet].

10. For you tried us, O God; you set us on fire as [2is set to the fire  1silver].

11. You brought us into the snare; you put afflictions upon  our back.

12. You set men over  our heads; we went through fire and water; but you led us unto respite.

13. I will enter into  your house with whole burnt-offerings. I will render to you  my vows,

14. which [2drew apart  1my lips], and [2spoke  1my mouth] in  my affliction.

15. Whole burnt-offerings being filled with marrow I will offer to you, with incense and rams. I will offer to you oxen with winter yearlings. PAUSE.

16. Come listen! and I will describe to you (all ones fearing  God) as many things as he did for my soul.

17. To him with my mouth I cried out, and I raised up high by  my tongue.

18. [3injustice 1If 2I had viewed] in my heart, let [2not 3listen to 4me 1the lord]!

19. On account of this [2listened to 3me  1God]; he took heed to the voice  of my supplication.

20. Blessed be the God who separated not from  my prayer, nor  his mercy from me.  

## Psalms 67

7. O God, in  your going forth before  your people in  your passing over in the wilderness,

8. the earth was shaken. For even the heavens dripped water before the face of the God  of Sinai; before the face of the God of Israel.

9. [2rain 3as a voluntary act 1Will you separate], O God, for your inheritance? Even it was weak, but you restored it.

10.  Your living creatures dwell in it; you prepared in  your graciousness for the poor.

11. The [2God 1 lord] shall give discourse to the ones announcing good news [2force 1for a great].

12. The king of the forces of the beloved, for the beauty of the house to divide the spoils.

1.  The LORD Delivers the Aching Soul To the director; for the changings; a psalm to David.  Deliver me, O God! for [2entered 1the waters] into my soul.

2. I was stuck in [2slime 1deep], and there is no support. I came to the depths of the sea, and the gale sank me.

3. I tired crying out; [2is sore  1my throat]. [2failed  1My eyes] from  my hope upon  my God.

4. [4multiplied 5over 6the 7hairs  8of my head 1The ones 2detesting 3me]. Freely [2were strengthened  1my enemies], the ones driving me out unjustly; [3what 4I did not 5seize by force 1then 2I paid for].

5. O God, you know  my folly, and  my trespasses, [3from 4you 1they are not 2concealed].

6. [5not 1May 6be ashamed 7over 8me 2the ones 3waiting upon 4you], O lord, O lord of the forces. [5not 1May 6feel shame 7over 8me 2the ones 3seeking 4you], O God  of Israel.

7. For because of you I endured scorning; [2covered 1shame]  my face.

8. [2one being separated from 1I was]  my brethren, and a stranger to the sons  of my mother.

9. For the zeal  of your house devoured me, and the scornings of the ones berating you fell upon me.

10. And I covered [2in 3fasting  1my soul], and it became for scornings to me.

11. And I put on  [2for my garment 1sackcloth], and I became to them as a parable.

12. [6against 7me 5meditated 1The ones 2sitting down 3at 4the gates]; and against me they strummed, even the ones drinking  wine.

13. But I will cry in my prayer to you, O lord, at a time of benevolence. O God, in the multitude  of your mercies heed me in the truth  of your deliverance!

14. Deliver me from mud! that I should not be stuck. May I be rescued from the ones detesting me, and from the depths of the waters.

15. [2not 6me 1Let 5sink 3the gale 4of water], nor let [2swallow 3me 1the deep], nor let [2constrain 4over 5me 1the well  3its mouth]!

16. Listen to me, O lord, for [2is gracious  1your mercy]! According to the multitude  of your compassions look upon me!

17. You should not turn  your face from  your servant, for I am afflicted. Quickly heed me!

18. Take heed to my soul, and ransom it! [3because of  4my enemies 1Rescue 2me]!

19. For you know  my scorning, and  my shame, and  my remorse. Before you are all the ones afflicting me.

20. [3scorning 2expected  1My soul] and misery; and I remained behind for one grieving, and he did not exist; and for ones comforting, but I did not find.

21. And they gave [2for  3my food 1bile]; and for  my thirst they gave [3to drink 1me 2vinegar].

22. Let [4become  1their table 2before 3them] as a snare, and for a recompense, and for an obstacle!

23. Let [2be darkened  1their eyes] to not see, and  their back always bent downwards!

24. Pour out upon them  your anger! and [2the 3rage  4of your anger 1may] overtake them.

25. Let [2become  1their property] having been made desolate! and [4in  5their tents 1let there not 2be  3one dwelling]!

26. For whom you struck, they pursued; and [2to 3the 4pain  5of my wounds 1they added].

27. Add lawlessness upon  their lawlessness! and let not [2enter 3in 1your righteousness]!

28. Let them be wiped away from out of the book of the living! and [3with 4the just 1let them not 2be written]!

29. [2poor 3and 4aching 1I am];  your deliverance, O God, may it take hold of me.

30. I will praise the name  of my God with an ode; I shall magnify him in praise,

31. and it shall please  God above [2calf 1a young 4horns 3bringing forth] and hoofs.

32. Let [2see 1the poor] and let them be glad! Inquire  of God! and [2shall live  1your soul].

33. For [2listens to 3the 4needy  1the lord]; and the ones of his being shackled he does not treat with contempt.

34. Let [3praise 4him 1the 2heavens], and the earth, sea, and all the things crawling in her!

35. For  God shall deliver  Zion, and [4shall be built up 1the 2cities  3of Judea]. And they shall dwell there, and they shall inherit her.

36. And the seed  of your servants shall hold her; and the ones loving  his name shall encamp in her.

4. O my God, rescue me from the hand of the sinner! from the hand of the one acting unlawfully and doing wrong.

5. For you are  my endurance, O Lord, O lord, the one of my hope from my youth.

8. Let [2be filled  1my mouth] of praise! that I may praise in song  of your glory; the entire  day  of your majesty.

9. You should not throw me away in the time of old age; in the failing  of my strength you should not abandon me. 

10.  Make The LORD Known to Each Generation For [2spoke  1my enemies] against me; and the ones watching out for my life consulted together,

11. saying,  God abandoned him; pursue and overtake him! for there is no  one rescuing him.

12. O my God, you should be not far from me. O my God, [2to  3my help 1take heed]!

13. Let [4be shamed 5and 6fail 1the ones 2slandering  3my soul]! Let [5put on 6shame 7and 8remorse 1the ones 2seeking  3bad things 4for me]!

14. But I always shall hope upon you, and I will add upon all  your praise.

15.  My mouth shall announce  your righteousness the entire  day;  your deliverance, for I did not know writings.

16. I will enter in the might of the lord. O lord, I will mention  your righteousness only.

17. You taught me, O God, from my youth; and until  now I will report  your wonders.

18. Even until old age, and of a senior, O my God, you should not abandon me until whenever I should report  your arm to [3generation 1every  2coming];

19.  of your might and  of your righteousness, O God, unto the highests, what [2you did 3to me 1magnificence]. O God, who is likened to you?

20. As much as you showed to me -- [2afflictions 1many] and bad things; but turning, you restored life to me; and from out of the abysses of the earth you led me.

21. You abounded to me  your greatness, and turning you comforted me; and from out of the abysses of the earth again you led me.

22. For also I will make acknowledgment to you among peoples, O lord; with an instrument for a psalm  of your truth, O God. I shall strum to you with the harp, O holy one  of Israel.

23. [2shall exult  1My lips] whenever I should strum to you, and  my soul which you ransomed.

10. On account of this [2shall return  1my people] here; and [2days 1full] shall be found with them.

11. And they said, How did God know? and, Is there knowledge in the highest?

12. Behold, these are the sinners, and they prosper into the eon, holding wealth.

13. And I said, Surely in folly I justified  my heart, and washed [2in 3innocent things  1my hands];

14. and became for whipping all the day; and  my reproof is in the mornings.

15. If I had said, I shall describe thus; behold, in the generation  of your sons, I have broken contract.

16. And I undertook  to know this, but it is toilsome before me;

17. until of which time I should enter into the sanctuary  of God, and should perceive to  their latter end.

18. Besides, on account of  their deceits you appointed evils unto them; you threw them down in their being lifted up.

19. O how they became for desolation. Suddenly they failed; they were destroyed because of  their lawlessness.

20. As a dream of one awakening, O lord, in  your city,  [2their image 1you will treat] with contempt.

21. For [2was kindled  1my heart], and  my kidneys were changed.

22. And I being with contempt, and not knowing, [2brutish 1became] before you.

23. But I was always with you; you held  [2hand  1my right],

24. and in  your counsel you guided me, and with glory you received me.

25. For what exists to me in the heaven? And besides you, what did I want upon the earth?

26. [4failed  1My heart 2and  3my flesh].  God is the strength of my heart, and  [2is my portion  1God] into the eon.

27. For behold, the ones being far [3by their own makings 1from 2you] shall perish. You utterly destroyed every one  committing harlotry from you.

28. But for me  to cleave to  God is good; to put [2in 3the 4 lord  1my hope];  for me to declare all  your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion.  

## Psalms 74

1.  Forget Not Your Servants, O LORD A psalm of contemplation to Asaph.  O God, why did you thrust us away unto the end? Why [2provoked to anger  1is your rage] against the sheep of your pasture?

2. Remember  your congregation! of which you acquired from the beginning. You ransomed the rod of your inheritance; [2mount 3Zion 1this] where you encamped in it.

3. Lift up  your hands against  their pride unto completion! for as much as [3did wickedly 1the 2enemy] in  your holy place.

4. And [4boasted 1the 2ones detesting 3you] in the midst  of your holiday; they set  their signs for signs.

5. And they knew not as in the conclusion above, as [2in 3the forest 4of woods 5with axes 1they cut down],

6. so [2its doors 3together 4with 5a hewing axe 6and 7chisel 1they broke down].

7. They set [2on 3fire  1your sanctuary] to the ground. They profaned the tent  of your name.

8. [3said 4in  5their heart  1Their kin 2together], Come and let us cause to cease all the holidays  of God from the land!

9.  [3our signs 1We did not 2see]; there is not yet a prophet; and one of us does not know any longer.

10. For how long, O God, shall [3berate 1the 2enemy]? He provokes the opposition  of your name to the end.

11. Why did you turn away  your hand, even  your right hand from the midst  of your bosom to the end?

12.  But God our king is before the eon. He worked deliverance in the midst of the earth.

13. You held [3in check 4by  5your power 1the 2sea]. You broke the heads of the dragons upon the water.

14. You fractured the heads of the dragon; you gave him for food [3peoples 1to the 2Ethiopian].

15. You tore open the springs and rushing streams. You dried the rivers of continuance.

16. Yours is the day, and yours is the night; you fashioned giving light and the sun.

17. You made all the boundaries of the earth; summer and spring, you shaped them.

18. Remember this! an enemy berated the lord, and [2people 1a foolish] provoked  your name.

19. You should not deliver up [4to the 5wild beasts 1a soul 2making acknowledgment 3to you]; of the souls  of your needy you should not forget to the end.

20. Look unto  your covenant! for [3filled 1the ones 2being darkened] the earth with houses of lawless deeds.

21. Let not [2be turned away 1the one being humbled] being disgraced! The poor and needy shall praise  your name.

22. Rise up, O God, adjudicate  your cause! Remember  your scorning by the fool the entire  day!

23. You should not forget the voice  of your servants. The pride of the ones detesting you ascended continually.  

## Psalms 75

1.  The LORD is Judge To the director; do not destroy; a psalm of an ode to Asaph.  I will make acknowledgment to you, O God; I shall make acknowledgment and shall call upon  your name. I shall describe all  your wonders.

2. Whenever I should receive the appointed time, I [2in straightness 1shall judge].

3. [3is melted away 1The 2earth] and all the ones dwelling in it. PAUSE. I solidified  its columns.

4. I said to the ones acting unlawfully, Do not act unlawfully! And to the sinners, Do not exalt the horn!

5. Do not lift up [2unto 3the height  1your horn], and do not speak against  God in unrighteousness!

6. For neither from exitings, nor from descents, nor from desolate mountains,

7. for  God is judge. This one he humbles, and this one he raises up high.

8. For a cup is in the hand of the lord [2wine 1of undiluted], a full mixture; and he leans it  this way unto this other way, but  its wine with dregs was not emptied out. [6shall drink 1All 2the 3sinners 4of the 5earth].

9. But I shall exult into the eon; I shall strum to the God of Jacob.

10. And all the horns of the sinners I shall fracture in pieces together, and [5shall be exalted 1the 2horn 3of the 4just].  

## Psalms 76

1.  Acknowledge The LORD To the director; among the hymns; a psalm to Asaph; an ode to the Assyrian.  [2is made known 3in  4Judea  1God]; in  Israel [2is great  1his name],

2. and [2became 3for 4peace  1his place]; and  his home is in Zion.

3. There he broke the might of the bows, the shield, and the broadsword, and war.

4. [3give light 1You 2wonderfully] from [2mountains 1the eternal].

5. [6were disturbed 1All 2the 3senseless 4in the 5heart]. [5slept 6their sleep 7and 8did not 9find 10anything 1All 2the 3men  4of wealth] in their hands.

6. Because of your reproach, O God of Jacob, [5slumbered 1the ones 2mounting 3the 4horses].

7. You are fearful, and who shall oppose you? For how long  is your anger?

8. From out of the heaven you caused [2to be heard 1judgment]. The earth feared, and was still,

9. in the rising up for judgment by God,  to deliver all the gentle in the earth. PAUSE.

10. For the inner thought of man shall make acknowledgment to you; and what is left of the inner thought shall solemnize a holiday to you.

11. Make a vow, and render to the lord  our God! All the ones round about him shall bring gifts

12. to the fearful one and the one removing the spirits of rulers; fearful to the kings of the earth.  

## Psalms 77

1.  The LORD is Powerful To the director; for Jeduthun; a psalm to Asaph.  With my voice [2to 3the lord 1I cried out]; my voice to  God; and he heeded me.

2. In the day of my affliction  I inquired of God.  [2my hands 1By night] were before him, and I was not deceived. [2refused 3to be comforted  1My soul].

3. I remembered  God and was glad. I meditated and [2was faint-hearted  1my spirit]. PAUSE.

4. [2first took 3watches  1My eyes]; I was disturbed and I did not speak.

5. I reasoned [2days 1about ancient]; and [3years 2everlasting 1I remembered].

6. And I meditated; [2by night 3with  4my heart 1I conversed], and [2tilled  1my spirit].

7. Shall [3into 4the 5eons 2thrust me away 1the lord]? And will he proceed to not  think well of me any more?

8. Or, [3at 4the end  2his mercy 1will he cut off]? Did he finish entirely his discourse from generation to generations?

9. Shall [2forget  3to pity  1God], or hold up [2in  3his anger  1his compassions]? PAUSE.

10. And I said, now I began. This is the change of the right hand of the highest.

11. I remembered the works of the lord. For I shall remember [2from 3the 4beginning  1your wonders],

12. and I shall meditate on all  your works; even in  your practices I will meditate.

13. O God, [2is in 3the 4holy place  1your way]. What God is great as  our God?

14. You are  God, the one doing wonders. You made known among the peoples  your power.

15. You ransomed [2by  3your arm  1your people], the sons of Jacob and Joseph.

16. [2beheld 3you 1The waters], O God, [2beheld 3you 1the waters] and feared; [2were disturbed 1the abysses].

17. There was a multitude of noises of waters; [4a sound 3gave out 1the 2clouds]; for also  your arrows travel abroad.

18. The sound  of your thunder in the wheel; [2appeared  1your lightnings] to the inhabitable world; [3was shaken 4and 5trembling 6took place 1the 2earth].

19. [2are in 3the 4sea  1Your ways], and  your roads are in [2waters 1many], and  your footsteps shall not be known.

20. You guided [2as 3sheep  1your people] by the hand of Moses and Aaron.  

## Psalms 78

1.  Generations Shall Praise The LORD A contemplation to Asaph.  Take heed, O my people,  to my law! Lean  your ear to the words  of my mouth!

2. I will open [2in 3parables  1my mouth]; I will utter riddles from the beginning;

3. as many as we heard and we know them, and  our fathers described to us.

4. They were not hidden from  their children for [2generation 1another]; but are reporting the praises of the lord, and  his dominations, and  his wonders which he did.

5. For he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and [2a law 1he put] in Israel, which he gave charge to our fathers,  to make them known to their sons;

6. so that [3should know 2generation 1another] -- the sons  being birthed. And they shall rise up and report them to their sons,

7. that they should put [2upon  3God  1their hope], and should not forget the works  of God, but  [2of his commandments 1shall inquire];

8. that they should not become as  their fathers -- [4generation 1a crooked 2and 3greatly embittered]; a generation which did not straightened out  its own heart, and [2was not 3trustworthy 4with  5God  1its spirit].

9. The sons of Ephraim stretching tight and shooting with bows, turned back in the day of battle.

10. They did not guard the covenant  of God, and [4by  5his law 1they did not 2want 3to go].

11. And they forgot  his good works, and  his wonders which he showed to them,

12. before  their fathers; what [2he did 1wonders] in the land of Egypt in the plain of Tanis.

13. How he tore up the sea, and led them through; and he stood the waters as a water bag.

14. And he guided them with a cloud by day, and the entire  night with the illumination of fire.

15. He tore open the rock in the wilderness, and he gave them a drink as in [2deep 1a vast].

16. And he brought water from the rock, and he led it down as rivers of waters.

17. And they proceeded still  to sin against him; they greatly embittered the highest in a waterless place.

18. And they put God to the test in  their hearts,  to ask foods  for their lives.

19. And they spoke ill  of God. And they said, Shall God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness?

20. For when he struck the rock, and there flowed waters, and rushing streams inundated, shall also [3bread 1he be able 2to give] or prepare a table for his people?

21. On account of this the lord heard, and was raised in anger. And a fire was lit in Jacob, and anger ascended upon  Israel.

22. For they did not trust in  God, nor did they hope upon  his deliverance.

23. And he gave charge to clouds far above, and the doors of heaven were opened,

24. and [2rained upon 3them 1manna] to eat; and [3the bread 4of heaven 1he gave 2to them].

25. [3bread 4of angels 2ate 1Man]; [3provisions 1he sent 2to them] in fullness.

26. He departed the south wind from heaven, and he brought on by  his power the southwest wind.

27. And he rained [2upon 3them 4as 5dust 1flesh]; even [3as 4the sand 5of the seas 2winged creatures 1feathered].

28. And they fell in the midst  of their camp round about  their tents.

29. And they ate, and were filled up exceedingly. And  [2their desire 1he brought] to them.

30. They were not deprived of  their desire; but  food was in  their mouth,

31. and the anger  of God ascended upon them; and he killed in  their plenty; and the chosen ones  of Israel he impeded.

32. In all these things they sinned still, and did not trust in  his wonders.

33. And [2ended 3in 4folly  1their days], and  their years with haste.

34. Whenever he killed them, then they sought him; and they turned and rose early to search for  God.

35. And they remembered that  God [2their helper 1is], and  God the Highest [2ransomer 1is their].

36. And they loved him by  their mouth, but  by their tongue they lied to him.

37.  And their heart was not straight with him, nor did they trust in  his covenant.

38. But he is one pitying, and he shall atone  their sins, and he will not utterly destroy. And he will fill the turning  of his rage, and shall not kindle all  his anger.

39. And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind going forth and not returning.

40. How often they greatly embittered him in the wilderness; they provoked him to anger in [2land 1a waterless].

41. And they turned and tested  God; even the holy one  of Israel they provoked.

42. They did not remember  his hand the day of which he ransomed them from out of the hand of one afflicting;

43. or how he made [2in 3Egypt  1his signs], and  his miracles in the plain of Tanis;

44. and he converted [2into 3blood  1their rivers], and  their showers so as to not drink.

45. He sent to them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it ruined them.

46. And he appointed the blight  for their fruits; and  [3for their miseries 1the 2locust].

47. He killed [2by 3hail  1their grapevine], and  their sycamine trees by the frost.

48. And he delivered up [2unto 3hail  1their cattle], and  their possessions to the fire.

49. He sent out to them the anger of his rage; rage and anger and affliction; a commission through [2angels 1wicked].

50. He opened the road  of his anger; he did not spare [2from 3death  1their souls]; and  [2their cattle 3to 4death 1he consigned].

51. And he struck every first-born in the land of Egypt; first-fruit of all their toil in the tents of Ham.

52. And he departed [2as 3sheep  1his people]; and he led them up as a flock in the wilderness.

53. And he guided them with hope; and they were not timid, and  [3their enemies 2covered 1the sea].

54. And he brought them into [2mountain 1his sanctified]; this mountain which [2acquired  1his right hand].

55. And he cast out [2before 3their face 1nations], and he allotted them by a line of inheritance. And he encamped [4among  5their tents 1the 2tribes  3of Israel].

56. And they tested and greatly embittered  God the highest; and  his testimonies they did not keep.

57. And they turned and annulled, as also  their fathers converted into [2bow 1a crooked].

58. And they provoked him to anger in  their hills; and in  their carvings they provoked him to jealousy.

59. God heard, and he overlooked; and he treated [2with contempt 3exceedingly  1Israel].

60. And he thrust away the tent of Shiloh, the tent in which he encamped among men.

61. And he delivered up [2into 3captivity  1their strength], and  their beauty into the hands of the enemies.

62. And he consigned [2by 3the broadsword  1his people]; and  his inheritance he overlooked.

63.  Their young men were devoured by fire, and  their virgins were not mourned for.

64.  Their priests [2by 3the broadsword 1fell], and  their widows shall not be wept over.

65. And [2awakened 3as  4from sleep 1the lord]; as a mighty one being dizzy from wine.

66. And he struck  his enemies unto the rear; [4scorn 3for eternal 1he appointed 2them].

67. And he thrust away the tent of Joseph; and the tribe of Ephraim he did not choose.

68. He chose the tribe of Judah,  mount  Zion which he loved.

69. And he built [2as 3the unicorn  1his sanctuary] in the earth; he laid its foundation into the eon.

70. And he chose David  his servant; and he took him from out of the flocks of the sheep;

71. even from behind the ones giving birth he took him, to tend Jacob  his servant, and Israel  his inheritance.

72. And he tended them in the innocence  of his heart; and in the skillfulness  of his hands he guided them.  

## Psalms 79

1.  A Cry Unto The LORD A psalm to Asaph.  O God, [2come 1nations] into  your inheritance; they defiled  [3temple  2holy 1your]; they made Jerusalem as a storehouse of fruits.

2. They made the decaying flesh  of your servants foods for the winged creatures of the heaven; the flesh  of your sacred ones for the wild beasts of the earth.

3. They poured out  their blood as water round about Jerusalem; and there was no one  burying them.

4. We became scorn to our neighbors; for a sneering and taunting by the ones round about us.

5. For how long, O lord? Will you be provoked to anger to the end? Will [2burn 3as 4fire  1your zeal]?

6. Pour out  your anger upon nations, the ones not perceiving you! and upon kingdoms in which  [2your name 1they called not upon].

7. For they devoured  Jacob, and  [2his place 1made] desolate.

8. You should not remember our lawless deeds of old. Quickly let [2be first to take 3us  1your compassions]! for we are [2poor 1exceedingly].

9. Help us, O God  our deliverer, because of the glory  of your name! O lord, rescue us, and atone  our sins, because of  your name!

10. Lest at any time [3should say 1the 2nations], Where is  their God? then let it be known among the nations, before  our eyes, the vengeance for the blood  of your servants  being poured out!

11. Let [5enter 6before 7you 1the 2moaning 3of the ones 4being shackled]! According to the greatness  of your arm protect the sons of the ones being put to death!

12. Repay to our neighbors seven-fold into  their bosom!  for their scorning which they berated you, O lord.

13. But we are your people, and the sheep of your pasture. We shall confess to you, O God, into the eon; for generation and generation we shall declare  your praise.  

## Psalms 80

1.  The LORD Delivers His People To the director; for the changings; a testimony to Asaph; a psalm.  O one tending  Israel, take heed! O one guiding [2as 3sheep  1Joseph], the one sitting down upon the cherubim -- appear!

2. Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh -- awaken  your might, and come for the delivering us!

3. O God, turn towards us, and let [2appear  1your face]! and we shall be delivered.

4. O lord  God of the forces, for how long are you provoked to anger over the prayer  of your servants?

5. You shall feed us bread of tears, and give us to drink with tears by measure.

6. You made us for dispute to our neighbors; and  our enemies sneer at us.

7. O lord  God of the forces, turn towards us, and let [2appear  1your face]! and we shall be delivered.

8. [2a grapevine 3from out of 4Egypt 1You moved]; you cast out nations, and planted her.

9. You opened a way before her, and you planted  her roots, and [3was filled 1the 2earth].

10. [2covered 3mountains  1Her shadow], and  her tendrils covered the cedars  of God.

11. She stretched out  her vine branches unto the sea, and [2unto 3the rivers  1her shoots].

12. Why did you demolish  her barrier, and [6gather her vintage 1all 2the ones 3passing by 4the 5way]?

13. [4laid her wasted 1The pig 2from 3the forest], and [2boar 1the wild] feeds on her.

14. O God of the forces, turn towards us indeed! And look upon us from out of heaven, and behold and visit  this grapevine!

15. And ready her whom [2planted  1your right hand]! and upon the son of man whom you fortified to yourself.

16. She is being set on fire and being dug up. From the reproach  of your face they shall be destroyed.

17. Let [2be  1your hand] upon the man of your right, even upon the son of man whom you strengthened to yourself.

18. For in no way should we separate from you. You shall enliven us, and  [2your name 1we shall call upon].

19. O lord  God of the forces, turn towards us, and let [2appear  1your face]! and we shall be delivered.  

## Psalms 81

1.  The LORD Leads Israel out of Egypt To the director; for the wine vats; a psalm to Asaph.  Exult  to God  our helper! Shout to the God of Jacob!

2. Take a psalm, and utter a sound on the tambourine, [2psaltery 1and the delightful] with the harp!

3. Trump during the new moon -- a trumpet in the well-marked day of your holiday!

4. For [2an order  3to Israel 1it is], and a judgment by the God of Jacob.

5. [3to be a testimony 4among  5Joseph 1He made 2it], during  his coming forth from out of the land of Egypt; a tongue which knew not, he heard.

6. He removed [2from 3tribute  1his back];  his hands [2to 3the 4hamper 1were enslaved].

7. In affliction you called upon me, and I rescued you. I heeded you in the concealed place of the gale; PAUSE. I tried you at Water of Dispute.

8. Hear, O my people! and I will testify to you, O Israel, if you should hear me.

9. There will not be in you a god newly made, nor shall you do obeisance to an alien god.

10. For I am the lord  your God; the one leading you from out of the land of Egypt. Widen  your mouth! and I shall fill it.

11. But [2did not 3hear  1my people]  my voice; and Israel gave no heed to me.

12. And I sent them out according to the practices  of their hearts; they shall go in  their practices.

13. If  my people heard me, [2Israel  4by my ways 1if 3were gone],

14. not the less would  [2their enemies 1I humbled], and [3upon 4the ones 5afflicting 6them 1I would have put  2my hand].

15. The enemies of the lord lied to him, and [2will be  1their time] into the eon.

16. And he fed them of the fat of wheat; and [3from out of 4the rock 5with honey 1he filled 2them].  

## Psalms 82

1.  The Judge Acts As God A psalm to Asaph.   God stood in the congregation of gods; [2in 3the midst 1and] of gods he examines.

2. For how long will you judge injustice, and [2persons 3of sinners 1receive]?

3. Judge for the orphan, and the poor! [2to the humble 3and 4needy 1Do justice]!

4. Deliver the needy and the poor! [3from 4the hand 5of the sinner 1rescue 2him]!

5. They did not know, nor perceived. [2in 3darkness 1They travel]. [6shall be shaken 1All 2the 3foundations 4of the 5earth].

6. I said, You are gods, and [2sons 3of the highest 1all].

7. But you [2as 3men 1die]; and [2as 3one 4of the 5rulers 1fall].

8. Rise up, O God, judge the earth! for you shall inherit among all the nations.  

## Psalms 83

1.  The LORD Reigns Over His Enemies An ode of a psalm to Asaph.  O God, who is likened to you? You should not keep quiet, nor soothe, O God.

2. For behold,  your enemies sounded, and the ones detesting you lift their head.

3. Against  your people they deal treacherously in design, and consult against  your holy ones.

4. They said, Come, for we should utterly destroy them from out of the nations; for in no way should [4be remembered 1the 2name 3of Israel] any longer.

5. For they consulted in concord together; against you [2a covenant 1they ordained];

6. even the tents of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarites;

7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the ones dwelling in Tyre.

8. For even also Assyria came together with them; they became an assistance to the sons of Lot. PAUSE.

9. Do to them as to Midian, and to Sisera; as to Jabin at the rushing stream Kishon!

10. They were utterly destroyed in En-dor. They became as dung for the earth.

11. Make  their rulers as  Oreb and Zeeb, and Zebah and Zalmunna -- all  their rulers!

12. Who said, We should inherit [4for ourselves 1the 2sanctuary  3of God]?

13. O my God, make them as a whirlwind; as stubble against the face of the wind!

14. as fire which shall burn up a forest; as a flame which incinerates mountains.

15. So shall you pursue them with  your gale; and in  your anger you shall disturb them.

16. Fill  their faces with dishonor! and they shall seek  your name, O lord.

17. Let them be shamed and disturbed into the eon of the eon! And let them feel remorse and be destroyed!

18. And let them know that the name to you is, the lord! You alone are highest over all the earth.  

## Psalms 84

1.  The Soul Longs for The LORD To the director; [2for 3the 4wine vats 5to the 6sons 7of Korah 1a psalm].  How beloved  are your tents, O lord of the forces.

2. [2longs after 3and 4falters  1My soul] for the courtyards of the lord.  My heart and  my flesh exulted over the living God.

3. For even the sparrow finds for himself a house; and the turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she puts  her own nestlings, even your altars, O lord of the forces,  my king and  my God.

4. Blessed are the ones dwelling in  your house; into the eons of the eons they shall praise you. PAUSE.

5. Blessed is the man in whom is the assistance to him from you; [4ascending 1in  2his heart 3he ordained];

6. into the valley of the place of weeping; into the place which he put himself. For even [4a blessing 3will give 1the one 2establishing law].

7. They shall go from force to force; they shall see the God  of gods in Zion.

8. O lord, the God of the forces, listen to  my prayer! Give ear, O God of Jacob! PAUSE.

9. [4our defender 1Behold 2O 3God], and look into the face  of your anointed one.

10. For better is [2day 1one] in  your courtyards than thousands. I would choose to be thrown aside in the house  of my God, rather than for me to live among the tents of sinners.

11. For [2mercy 3and 4truth 1the lord loves].  God [2favor 3and 4glory 1shall give]. The lord will not deprive  good things to the ones going in innocence.

12. O lord, the God of the forces, blessed is the man  hoping upon you.  

## Psalms 85

1.  The LORD Offers Deliverance To the director; [2to the 3sons 4of Korah 1A psalm].  You thought well, O lord,  of your land. You returned the captivity of Jacob.

2. You forgave the lawless deeds  of your people. You covered all  their sins.

3. You rested all  of your anger. You turned from the anger of your rage.

4. Turn us, O God  of our deliverances, and turn  your rage from us!

5. Shall you [3into 4the 5eons 1be provoked to anger 2against us]? Or shall you extend  your anger from generation unto generation?

6. O God, you, in turning towards us shall enliven us, and  your people shall be glad over you.

7. Show to us, O lord,  your mercy! and  [2your deliverance 1may you give] to us.

8. I shall hear what [3shall speak 4to 5me 1the lord  2God]; for he shall speak peace unto  his people, and unto  his sacred ones, and unto the ones turning hearts unto him.

9. Moreover [2is near 3the ones 4fearing 5him  1his deliverance]; so that [2may encamp 1his glory] in  our land.

10. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace kissed.

11. Truth [2from out of 3the 4land 1arose]; and righteousness [2from  3heaven 1looks through].

12. For even the lord shall give graciousness; and  our land shall give  its fruit.

13. Righteousness [2before 3him 1shall go forth], and he shall place [2in 3the way  1his footsteps].

7. In the day of my affliction I cried out to you, for you heeded me.

8. There is not one likened to you among gods, O lord; and there is not one likened according to  your works.

9. All the nations, as many as you made, shall come and do obeisance before you, O lord, and they shall glorify  your name.

10. For [2great 1you are], and performing wonders. You are the only God.

11. Guide me, O lord, in  your way! and I will go in  your truth. Let [2be glad  1my heart]  to fear  your name!

12. I shall make acknowledgment to you, O lord  my God, with [2entire 3heart 1my]; and I will glorify  your name into the eon.

13. For  your mercy is great towards me; and you rescued  my soul from out of [2Hades 1lowermost].

14. O God, lawbreakers rose up against me, and a gathering of strong ones sought  my life; and they did not set you before them.

15. And you, O lord  my God, are pitying and merciful, lenient and full of mercy, and true.

16. Look upon me, and show mercy on me! Give  your might to your child, and deliver the son  of your maidservant!

17. Establish with me a sign for good, and let [4see 1the 2ones detesting 3me], and be ashamed! For you, O lord, helped me, and comforted me.

## Psalms 88

1.  The LORD Hears the Destitute An ode of a psalm to the sons of Korah; for the director; by the harp  to respond for contemplation to Heman the Israelite.  O lord, the God  of my deliverance; [4day 1I cried out 5and 6at 7night 2before 3you].

2. Let [2enter 3before 4you  1my prayer]! Lean  your ear to  my supplication!

3. For [2is filled 3of bad things  1my soul], and  my life  [2Hades 1approached].

4. I was counted with the ones going down into the pit. I became as [2man 1an incurable];

5. [2among 3the dead 1free], as ones slain sleeping in the tomb, whom you do not remember any longer; and they [2from out of  3your hand 1were thrusted away].

6. They put me in [2pit 1the lowermost], in dark places, and in the shadow of death.

7. Upon me [2stayed  1your rage], and [4all  5your crests 1you brought 2upon 3me]. PAUSE.

8. You distanced [3the ones 4knowing 5me 1from 2me]. You made me an abomination to them. I have been delivered up, and have not gone forth.

9.  My eyes are weakened from poorness. I cried out to you, O lord, the entire  day. I opened and spread out to you  my hands.

10. Shall [3for the 4dead 1you do 2wonders]? or shall physicians rise up and make acknowledgment to you?

11. Shall [4describe 1any one 2in 3the tomb]  your mercy and  your truth in the destruction?

12. Shall [2be made known 3in 4the 5darkness  1your wonders]? and  your righteousness in a land being forgotten?

13. But I [2to 3you 4O lord 1cried out]; and in the morning  my prayer shall be with you beforehand.

14. Why, O lord, do you thrust away  my soul, and turn  your face from me?

15. [2poor 1I am] and in troubles from my youth. But being raised up high I was humbled and left destitute.

16. Upon me [2went  1your angers];  your frightful things disturbed me.

17. They encircle me as water; the entire  day they compassed me together.

18. You put far from me friend and near one, and the ones knowing me, because of misery.  

## Psalms 89

1.  The Earth and Heavens Acknowledge The LORD A contemplation of Ethan the Ezrahite.   [2of your mercies 3O lord 4into 5the 6eon 1I shall sing]. Unto generation and generation I shall report  your truth with  my mouth.

2. For you said, Into the eon mercy shall be built up. [3in 4the 5heavens 2shall be prepared  1Your truth].

3. I ordained a covenant with my chosen ones; I swore by an oath to David  my servant.

4. Unto the eon I shall prepare  your seed, and I will build [2unto 3generation 4and 5generation  1your throne].

5. [3shall acknowledge 1The 2heavens]  your wonders, O lord, and  your truth in the assembly of the holy ones.

6. For who in the clouds shall be equal to the lord; likened to the lord among the sons of God?

7.  God is being glorified in the counsel of holy ones; [2great 3and 4fearful 1he is] over all the ones surrounding him.

8. O lord, the God of the forces, who is likened to you? You are mighty, O lord, and  your truth is round about you.

9. You are master of the might of the sea; and the tossing about  of its waves you soothe.

10. You humbled [2as 3slain 1the proud]; with the arm  of your might you dispersed  your enemies.

11. [3are yours 1The 2heavens], and [3is yours 1the 2earth]. The inhabitable world and  its fullness you founded.

12. The north and the west you created. Tabor and Hermon [2in  3your name 1shall exult].

13. Your  arm is with dominations. Let [2be fortified  1your hand]! Let [2be raised up high  1your right hand]!

14. Righteousness and equity are the preparation  of your throne; mercy and truth shall go forth before your face.

15. Blessed are the people  knowing the shout of joy. O lord, [2in 3the 4light  5of your face 1they shall go].

16. And in  your name they shall exult the entire  day. And in  your righteousness they shall be raised up high.

17. For [3the 4boast  5of their power 1you 2are]; and by  your benevolence [2shall be raised up high  1our horn].

18. For [2is of the 3 lord  1assistance], and of the holy one of Israel, our king.

19. Then you spoke in a vision to your sons, and said, I put help upon a mighty one; raising up high a chosen one from out of  my people.

20. I found David  my servant. [3with 5oil 4my holy 1I anointed 2him].

21.  For my hand shall be an aid to him; and  my arm shall strengthen him.

22. [2shall not 3derive benefit 1The enemy] by him; and the son of lawlessness shall not proceed  to inflict evil on him.

23. And I will cut down [2from 3in front 4of him  1his enemies]; and the ones detesting him shall be put to flight.

24. And  my truth and  my mercy are with him; and in  my name [2shall be raised up high  1his horn].

25. And I will set [2in 3the sea 1his hand], and [2in 3rivers 1his right hand].

26. He shall call upon me, saying, [2my father 1You are], my God, and the shielder  of my deliverance.

27. And I [3first-born 1will make 2him], high above the kings of the earth.

28. Into the eon I shall guard to him  my mercy; and  my covenant is trustworthy to him.

29. And I shall establish [2into 3the 4eon 5of the 6eon  1his seed], and  his throne as the days  of heaven.

30. If [2should abandon  1his sons]  my law, and  [3by my judgments 1should not 2go];

31. if  [2my ordinances 1they should profane], and  [3my commandments 1should not 2keep];

32. then I will visit [2with 3a rod  1their lawlessnesses]; and [2with 3whips  1their iniquities].

33.  But my mercy in no way should I efface from them, nor in any way should I wrong in  my truth;

34. nor in any way should I profane  my covenant; and the things going forth through  my lips in no way should I annul.

35. Once I swore by an oath by  my holiness; shall  I lie to David, no.

36.  His seed [2into 3the 4eon 1shall abide], and  his throne as the sun before me;

37. and as the moon being readied into the eon, and the [2witness 3in 4heaven 1trustworthy]. PAUSE.

38. But you thrusted away and treated with contempt. You raised  your anointed one.

39. You eradicated the covenant  of your servant. You profaned in the land  of his sanctuary.

40. You demolished all  his barriers. You made  his fortresses dreaded.

41. [5plundered 6him 1All 2the ones 3traveling through 4the way]. He became scorn to his neighbors.

42. You raised up high the right hand of the ones afflicting him; you made glad all  his enemies.

43. You turned back the help  of his broadsword, and did not assist him in  battle.

44. You rested from cleansing him.  [2his throne 3unto 4the 5ground 1You broke down].

45. You diminished the days  of his throne. You poured upon him shame.

46. For how long, O lord, will you turn away -- to the end? Will [2burn 3as 4fire  1your anger]?

47. Remember what  my reality is; for acting in folly, did you creat all the sons  of men?

48. Who is the man who shall live and not see death? Shall he rescue  his own soul from out of the hand of Hades? PAUSE.

49. Where are  [3mercies 1your  2ancient], O lord, which you swore by an oath  to David in  your truth?

50. Remember, O lord, the scorning  of your servants! which I underwent in  my bosom, of many nations;

51. where [2berated  1your enemies], O lord, where they berated the equivalent  of your anointed one.

52. Blessed be the lord into the eon. May it be. May it be.  

## Psalms 90

1.  The LORD is Unto the Eons A prayer by Moses the man  of God.  O lord, [2a refuge 1you became] for us unto generation and generation.

2. Before the mountains existed, and [5took shape 1the 2earth 3and  4inhabitable world]; even from  eon and until the eon you are.

3. You should not return man unto humiliation, whereas you said, Return, O sons of men!

4. For a thousand years in your eyes, O lord, are as day --  yesterday which went, and is as a watch in the night.

5.  [3their contempt 1Years 2shall be]; [2the morning 3as 4tender shoots 1may it go by];

6. [2in the morning 1blooming], and may it go by; in the evening it shall fall away, may it be hardened and dried up.

7. For we faltered in  your anger, and in  your rage we were disturbed.

8. You put  our lawlessness before you;  our eon in the illumination  of your face.

9. For all  our days failed; even in  your anger we failed.  Our years are as of a spider meditating.

10. The days  of our years among them are seventy years; but if by commands -- eighty years, but  much of them toil and misery; for [2comes 1mellowing] upon us, and we shall be corrected.

11. Who knows the power  of your anger? and [2because of 3the 4fear   5of your rage 1how to count out his days]?

12.  [4your right hand 1So 2make known 3to me]! and the ones being corrected in the heart by wisdom.

13. Return, O lord! For how long? and give comfort unto  your servants!

14. We were filled up in the morning with your mercy, O lord, and we exulted and were glad in all  our days.

15. We were gladdened because of the days you humbled us; years which we beheld bad things.

16. And look upon  your servants, and upon  your works, and guide  their sons!

17. And let [5be 1the 2brightness 3of the lord  4our God] upon us! And [4the 5works  6of our hands 1prosper 2for 3us] -- yes, [2the 3work  4of our hands 1prosper]!  

## Psalms 91

2. He shall say to the lord, [2shielder 1You are my], and my refuge;  my God, and I will hope upon him.

3. For he shall rescue you from out of the snare of hunters, from [2matter 1a disturbing].

4. With  his upper back he shall overshadow you, and under  his wings you shall hope. [3with the shield 1He shall encircle 2you]  of his truth.

5. You shall not be afraid from fear by night, nor from an arrow flying by day,

6. nor from a thing [2in 3darkness 1going], nor from an adverse incident, and the demon at midday.

7. [2shall fall 3at  4your side 1A thousand], and myriads at your right hand; [3unto 4you 1but 2it shall not approach].

8. Only with your eyes you shall contemplate; and [2the recompense 3of sinners 1you shall see].

9. For you, O lord, the one of my hope; [2the 3highest 1you made] your refuge.

10. There shall not come near to you bad things; and the whip shall not approach in  your tent.

11. For to his angels he gives charge concerning you,  to guard you in all  your ways.

12. By hands they will lift you, lest at any time you should stumble [2against 3a stone  1your foot].

13. [2upon 3the asp 4and 5cobra 1You shall set foot]; and you shall trample on the lion and dragon.

14. For [2upon 3me 1he hoped], and I shall rescue him. I will shelter him, for he knew  my name.

15. He shall cry out to me, and I shall heed him. [2with 3him 1I am] in affliction. I will rescue him and glorify him.

5. O how [2were magnified  1your works], O lord; [3exceedingly 2deepen  1your thoughts].

6. [2man 1A foolish] will not know, and the senseless shall not perceive these things.

7. In the rising up of the sinners as grass, and [5look on 1all 2the 3ones working  4lawlessness], that thus they shall be utterly destroyed into the eon of the eon.

8. But you are the highest into the eon, O lord.

9. For behold,  your enemies, O lord, for behold,  your enemies shall perish, and [5shall be dispersed 1all 2the ones 3working  4lawlessness].

10. And [2shall be raised up high 3as 4a unicorn  1my horn]; and  my old age with [2oil 1plentiful].

11. And [2looked  1my eye] on  my enemies, and [4among 5the ones 6rising up 7against 8me 3the ones acting wickedly 2shall hear  1my ear].

12. The just one [2as 3a palm tree 1shall bloom]; as a cedar  in  Lebanon he shall be multiplied.

13. The ones being planted in the house of the lord, in the courtyards  of our God, shall blossom.

14. Still they shall be multiplied in [2old age 1plentiful]; and [2enjoying pleasure 1they will be];  to announce

15. that [3is upright 1the lord  2our God], and there is no injustice in him.  

## Psalms 93

1.  The LORD Reigns For the day  before the Sabbath; when [3was settled 1the 2land]; praise of an ode to David.  The lord reigned; [2beauty 1he put on]; the lord put on power and girded himself.  For he solidified the inhabitable world, which shall not be shaken.

2. [2was prepared  1Your throne] from then; from the eon you are.

3. [3lifted up 1The 2rivers], O lord, [3lifted up 1the 2rivers] their voices.

4. [3shall take away 1The 2rivers]; you shall wear them away by sounds [2waters 1of many]. [5are wonderful 1the 2crests 3of the 4sea]; [3is wonderful 4in 5high places 1the 2 lord].

5.  Your testimonies are trustworthy -- exceedingly. [3to 4your house 2is becoming 1Sanctification], O lord, for the duration of days.

1.  The LORD Recompenses Evil A psalm to David; fourth of Sabbath.  The God of acts of vengeance. The lord  God of acts of vengeance spoke openly.

2. Rise up high, O one judging the earth! Render recompense to the proud!

3. For how long sinners, O lord, how long shall sinners boast?

4. They will utter and speak injustice; [5shall speak 1all 2the ones 3practicing  4iniquity].

5.  Your people, O lord, they humbled; and  [2your inheritance 1they inflicted evil on].

6. The widow and orphan they killed; and the foreigner they murdered.

7. And they said, [2shall not 3see 1the lord], nor shall [4perceive 1the 2God  3of Jacob].

8. Perceive indeed foolish among the people! and O moron, [2at some time or other 1think]!

9. The one planting the ear, does he not hear? or the one shaping the eye, does he not contemplate?

10. The one correcting nations, shall he not reprove? The one teaching man knowledge;

11. the lord, he knows the thoughts  of men, for they are vain.

12. Blessed is a man whom ever you should correct, O lord, and from out of  your law you should teach him;

13.  to calm him from [2days 1evil], until of which time he should have dug [2for the 3sinner 1the pit].

14. For [2shall not 3thrust away 1the lord]  his people, and  [3his inheritance 1he shall not 2abandon];

15. until of which time righteousness returns for judgment, and having it are all the straight  in heart. PAUSE.

16. Who shall rise up to me against the ones acting wickedly? or who shall stand up with me against the ones working  lawlessness?

17. Unless that the lord helped me, [2would 3shortly 4have sojourned  5in Hades  1my soul].

18. If I said, [2shakes  1My foot];  your mercy, O lord, helps me.

19. According to the multitude  of my griefs in  my heart, so your comforts made glad  my soul.

20. Shall [3adhere with 4you 1the throne 2of lawlessness], the one shaping trouble out of order?

21. They shall hunt for [2soul 1a just], and [3blood 2innocent 1condemn].

22. But [2became 3to me 1the lord] for a refuge; and  my God for a helper of my hope.

23. And he shall recompense to them  their lawlessness; and according to  their wickedness [3shall remove them from view 1The lord  2God].  

## Psalms 95

1.  The LORD Remembers His People A praise of an ode to David.  Come, we should make exultation to the lord; we should shout to God  our deliverer.

2. We should go before  his presence with acknowledgment; and by psalms we should sound aloud to him.

3. For [3God 2is a great 1the lord], and [2king 1a great] above all the earth.

4. For in  his hand are the ends of the earth; and the heights of the mountains are his.

5. For his is the sea, and he himself made it; and [3the 4dry land 1his hands 2shaped].

6. Come, we should do obeisance and fall before him; and weep before the lord, the one making us.

7. For he is  our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if  [2his voice 1you should hear],

8. you should not harden  your hearts as in the embittering, according to the day of the test in the wilderness,

9. of which [2tested 3me  1your fathers]; they tried me, and they beheld  my works.

10. Forty years I loathed  that generation, and said, They continually wander in the heart, and they do not know  my ways.

11. So I swore by an oath in  my anger, Shall they enter into  my rest, no.

7. [6were shamed 1All 2the ones 3doing obeisance to 4the 5carvings]; the ones boasting in  their idols. Let [3do obeisance to 4him 1all 2his angels]!

8. [2heard 3and 4was glad  1Zion]; and [4exulted 1the 2daughters  3of Judea] because of  your judgments, O lord.

9. For you the lord  are highest over all the earth -- exceedingly. You were greatly exalted above all the gods.

10. The ones loving the lord detest evil. The lord guards the souls  of his sacred ones. From out of the hand of the sinner he shall rescue them.

3. Let them acknowledge  [3name 1your  2great]! for [2fearful 3and 4holy 1he is].

4. And the honor of the king [2equity 1loves]. You prepared straight judgment; and [3righteousness 4in 5Jacob 1you 2established].

5. Raise up high the lord  our God, and do obeisance at the footstool  of his feet! for he is holy.

6. Moses and Aaron are among  his priests, and Samuel is among the ones calling upon  his name. They called upon the lord, and he listened to them.

7. In a column of cloud he spoke to them; for they guarded  his testimony, and  his orders which he gave to them.

8. O lord  our God, you heeded them. O God, you [2propitious 1became] to them, yet punishing over all  their practices.

9. Raise up high the lord  our God, and do obeisance at [2mountain 1his holy]! for [3is holy 1the lord  2our God].  

## Psalms 100

5. For [2is gracious 1the lord]; [2is into 3the 4eon  1his mercy], and [2unto 3generation 4and 5generation  1his truth].  

## Psalms 101

1.  Mercy and Judgment A psalm to David.  About mercy and judgment I shall sing to you, O lord.

2. I shall strum, and I shall perceive in [2way 1an unblemished]. When shall you come to me? I traveled in the innocence of my heart; in the midst  of my house.

3. I did not set before my eyes [2thing 1an illegal]; [2ones committing 3violations 1I detested].

4. [3cleaved not 4to me 2heart 1A crooked], turning aside from me, the wicked man I knew not.

5. The one speaking ill in private of the ones near him -- this one I drove out. Proud eye and insatiable heart -- with this one I ate not.

6.  My eyes are upon the trustworthy of the land,  for them to sit together with me, going in [2way 1an unblemished]. This one officiated to me.

7. [3dwelt not 4in 5the midst  6of my house 1one having 2pride]. One speaking unjust did not conduct anything before  my eyes.

8. Into the morning I killed all the sinners of the land;  to utterly destroy from out of the city of the lord all the ones practicing  lawlessness.  

## Psalms 102

1.  The Discouraged Hope in The LORD A prayer to the poor whenever he is discouraged, and [3before 4the lord 1he should pour out  2his supplication].  O lord, listen to  my prayer, and  [2my cry 4unto 5you 1let 3come]!

2. You should not turn  your face from me in which ever day I should be afflicted. Lean to me  your ear! in which ever day I should call upon you. Quickly heed me!

3. For [2dissipated 3as 4smoke  1my days], and  my bones [2as 3dried sticks 1are parched].

4. [2is struck down 3as 4grass 5and 6is dried up  1My heart], so that I forgot  to eat  my bread.

5. From the sound  of my moaning [2cleaves  1my bone] to my flesh.

6. I became like [2pelican 1a solitary]; I became as the long-eared owl in its area.

7. I was sleepless and I became as a sparrow living alone upon a roof.

8. All the day [2berated 3me  1my enemies], and the ones praising me [2against 3me 1swore an oath].

9. For [2ashes 3as 4bread 1I ate], and  my drink [2with 3weeping 1is being diluted];

10. because of the face  of your anger, and  your rage; for having lifted me up you broke me down.

11.  My days [2as 3a shadow 1declined], and I as grass am dried up.

12. But you, O lord, [2into 3the 4eon 1abide], and  your memorial unto generation and generation.

13. In your rising up you shall pity  Zion, for it is time  to pity it, for [2comes 1the time].

14. For [2thought well of  1your servants]  her stones, and  [2her dust 1shall pity].

15. And [3shall fear 1the 2nations] the name of the lord, and all the kings of the earth  your glory.

16. For the lord shall build up  Zion, and he shall appear in  his glory.

17. He looked upon the prayer of the humble, and did not treat [2with contempt  1their supplication].

18. Let this be written for [2generation 1another]! and the people  being created shall praise the lord.

19. For he looked out from the height of his holy place. The lord [2from 3heaven 4upon 5the 6earth 1looked],

20.  to hear the moaning of the ones being shackled,  to untie the sons of the ones being killed,

21.  to announce in Zion the name of the lord, and  his praise in Jerusalem,

22. in the assembling of peoples together, and kings  to serve to the lord.

23. It shall be answered by him in the way of his strength; [3the 4fewness  5of my days 1he announced 2to me].

24. You should not lead me away in half of my days; [2are in 3generation 4of generations  1your years].

25. At the beginning, you, O lord, [2for the 3earth 1laid a foundation]; and the works  of your hands are the heavens.

26. They shall perish, but you shall abide. And all as a garment shall become old; and as a wrap-around garment you shall coil them, and they shall be changed.

27. But you [2the 3same 1are], and  your years shall not cease.

28. The sons  of your servants shall encamp, and  their seed [2into 3the 4eon 1shall conduct matters].  

## Psalms 103

1.  Bless The LORD, O My Soul A psalm to David.  Bless  [3O my soul 1the 2 lord], and all the things within me, bless [2name  1his holy]!

2. Bless  [3O my soul 1the 2 lord], and forget not all  his recompenses!

3. the one propitiating all  your lawlessnesses; the one healing all  your diseases;

4. the one ransoming [2from out of 3corruption  1your life]; the one crowning you with mercy and compassions;

5. the one filling [2with 3good things  1your desire]. [2shall be renewed 3as 4an eagle  1Your youth].

6. The one doing charity is the lord, and judgment to all the ones having been wronged.

7. He made known  his ways to Moses; to the sons of Israel  his wants.

8. Pitying and merciful is the lord; lenient and full of mercy.

9. Not unto the end shall he be provoked to anger, nor into the eon will he cherish wrath.

10. Not according to  our lawless deeds did he deal with us; nor according to  our sins did he recompense to us.

11. For as the height of the heaven from the earth, so the lord fortified  his mercy upon the ones fearing him.

12. According to as much as the distance eastwards from westwards, he set afar from us  our lawlessnesses.

13. As [2pities 1a father] his sons, so the lord pities the ones fearing him.

14. For he knew  our shape, he remembered that we are dust.

15. Man, as grass,  so are his days; as a flower of the field, so he shall blossom.

16. For as wind goes by him, and it no longer exists, so also he shall not recognize [2any longer  1his place].

17. But the mercy of the lord from the eon, and unto the eon, is upon the ones fearing him. And  his righteousness is upon the sons of the sons;

18. to the ones guarding  his covenant, and to the ones remembering  his commandments  to observe them.

19. The lord [3in 4the 5heaven 1prepared  2his throne], and  [2his kingdom 1he is master of all].

20. Bless the lord all you his angels, mighty in strength, executing  his word,  to hearken to the sound  of his words!

21. Bless the lord, all you his forces! his ministers performing  his will.

22. Bless the lord, all you his works, in every place  of his dominion! Bless  [3O my soul 1the 2 lord]!  

## Psalms 104

1.  The LORD Creates the Earth in Wisdom A psalm to David.  Bless  [3O my soul 1the 2 lord]! O lord  my God, you are magnified exceedingly. [2acknowledgment 3and 4majesty 1You clothed yourself with];

2. cloaking on light as a garment; stretching out the heaven as a hide covering;

3.  roofing [2with 3waters  1his upper rooms];  placing clouds  for his step; the one walking upon the wings of the winds;

4. the one making  his angels winds, and  his ministers [2of fire 1a flame];

5. the one laying the foundation for the earth in  its stability (it shall not lean into the eon of the eon);

6. the deep as a garment  of his wrap. Upon the mountains [2shall stand 1waters];

7. from your reproach they shall flee; from the sound of your thunder they shall show timidity.

8. They ascend the mountains, and go down to the plains, to a place where you laid a foundation for them.

9. [2a limit 1You placed] which they shall not pass, nor shall they return to cover the earth.

10. The one sending out springs in ravines; [3in the midst 4of the 5mountains 2shall go through 1waters];

11. they shall water all the wild beasts of the field; [2shall receive it 1wild donkeys] for their thirst;

12. by them the winged creatures of the heaven shall encamp; from between the rocks they shall give out a sound;

13. watering mountains from out of  his upper rooms. By the fruit  of your works [3shall be filled 1the 2earth].

14. The one causing [2to rise up 1grass] to the cattle, and tender shoots to the service of the men,  to bring bread from the earth;

15. and wine makes glad the heart of man;  to make [2happy 1his face] with olive oil; and bread [2the heart 3of man 1supports].

16. [5shall be filled 1The 2woods 3of the 4plain] with the cedars  of Lebanon which you planted.

17. There the sparrows will nest; [2of the 3heron  1the dwelling] takes lead over them;

18. [2mountains  1the high] for the stags; a rock of refuge for the hyrax.

19. He made the moon for seasons; the sun knows  his setting.

20. You made darkness, and [2happened 1night]; [7in 8it 6go 1all 2the 3wild beasts 4of the 5forest].

21. Lion cubs roaring  to seize by force; and seeking from  God food for themselves.

22. [3arose 1The 2sun], and they were brought together, and in  their lairs they shall lay down.

23. [2shall go forth 1Man] unto  his work, even unto  his work until evening.

24. How [2were magnified  1your works], O lord; [2all 3in 4wisdom 1you made]; [3was filled 1the 2earth]  of your creation;

25. this the [2sea  1great] and broad space; located there are reptiles which there is no count; living creatures -- small with the great;

26. there boats travel over; this dragon whom you shaped to sport in it.

27. All [2from 3you 1expect] to give  them nourishment in an opportune time.

28. At your giving to them, they shall collect; opening your  hand,  all things shall be filled by that which is good.

29. But at the turning of your  face they shall be disturbed; you shall take away in return  their spirit, and they shall fail, and unto  their dust they shall return.

30. You shall send out  your spirit, and they shall be created; and you shall renew the face of the earth.

31. Let [4be 1the 2glory 3of the lord] into the eons! The lord shall be glad over  his works;

32. the one looking upon the earth, and making it to tremble; the one touching the mountains and they smoke.

33. I shall sing to the lord in  my life. I shall strum to my God while I exist.

34. Let [2be delicious 3to him  1my versification], and I shall be glad in the lord.

35. [2failed 1Sinners] from the earth, and lawless ones so as for [2to not 3exist 1them]. Bless  [3O my soul 1the 2 lord]!  

## Psalms 105

1.  The LORD Remembers His Covenant Alleluiah.  Make acknowledgment to the lord, and call upon  his name! Report among the nations  of his works!

8. He remembered [2into 3the 4eon 1his covenant]; the word which he gave charge for a thousand of generations;

9. which he ordained with Abraham, and  his oath to Isaac.

10. And he established it to Jacob for an order, and to Israel for [2covenant 1an eternal],

11. saying, To you I give the land of Canaan, a piece of measured out land for your inheritance.

12. In  their being [2in number 1few], very few, and sojourners in it;

13. that they went from nation to nation, and from a kingdom to [2people 1another].

14. He did not let a man wrong them; and he reproved [2for 3them 1kings], saying,

15. Do not touch  my anointed ones! and among  my prophets do not do wickedly!

16. And he called famine upon the land; [2all 3reliance 4on bread 1he broke].

17. He sent in front of them a man; [3for 4a servant 2was sold 1Joseph].

18. They humbled [2with 3shackles  1his feet]; [3iron 2went through  1his soul];

19. until  [2came  1his word]; the oracle of the lord purified him.

20. [2sent 1The king] and untied him, even a ruler of the people, and let him go.

21. He placed him as master  of his house, and ruler of all  his possessions;

22.  to instruct  his rulers as he himself, and  [2his elders 1to make] wise.

23. And Israel entered into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. And [2grew  1his people] exceedingly; and he fortified it above  his enemies.

25. He converted  his heart  to detest  his people;  to use deceit with  his servants.

26. He sent out Moses  his servant; Aaron whom he chose for himself.

27. He put among them the matters  of his signs, and  of his miracles in the land of Ham.

28. He sent out darkness, and it darkened; and they rebelled against  his words.

29. He converted  their waters into blood, and killed  their fishes.

30. [2crept forth  3in their land 1Frogs]; in the closets  of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came the dog-fly and midges in all  their borders.

32. He made  their rains into hail, and fire burning up in  their land.

33. And he struck  their grapevines, and  their fig-trees; and he broke every tree of their border.

34. He spoke, and there came forth the locust and grasshopper, of which there was no number.

35. And they devoured all the grass in  their land, and devoured the fruit  of their land.

36. And he struck every first-born in  their land, first-fruit of all their toil.

37. And he led them out with silver and gold; and there was not one among  their tribes  being weak.

38. Egypt was glad in  their exodus; for [4fell 1the 2fear 3of them] upon them.

39. He opened and spread out a cloud for their protection, and fire  to give light to them  at night.

40. They asked for, and [2came 1the mother-quail], and the bread of heaven filled them.

41. He tore open the rock, and [2flowed 1the waters]; [2went 3to 4waterless places 1rivers].

42. For he remembered  [2word  1his holy]  spoken to Abraham  his servant.

43. And he led out  his people in exultation, and  his chosen ones in gladness.

44. And he gave to them the places of nations, and produce of the toils of the peoples that they inherited;

45. so that they should guard  his ordinances, and  [2his law 1seek after].  

## Psalms 106

1.  The LORD's Compassion Over Lawless Israel Alleluiah  Make acknowledgment to the lord, for he is gracious; for into the eon  is his mercy.

2. Who shall speak the mighty deeds of the lord? Audibly, who shall offer all  his praises?

3. Blessed are the ones keeping equity, and doing righteousness in every season.

4. Remember us, O lord, with the benevolence  of your people! Visit us with  your deliverance!

5.  To behold in the thing gracious  of your chosen ones;  to be glad in the gladness  of your nation;  to applaud with  your inheritance.

6. We sinned with  our fathers; we acted lawlessly; we did wrong.

7.  Our fathers in Egypt did not perceive  your wonders, they remembered not the magnitude  of your mercy; and they rebelled while ascending unto the red sea.

8. And he delivered them because of  his name,  to make known  his might.

9. And he reproached the red sea, and it was dried up. And he guided them in the deep as in the wilderness.

10. And he delivered them out of the hand of the one detesting; and he ransomed them out of the hand of enemies.

11. [2covered 1Water] the ones afflicting them; [2one 3of 4them 1not] was left behind.

12. And they trusted in his word; and they were  his praise.

13. They hastened; they forgot  his works; they did not wait  for his counsel.

14. And they desired with desire in the wilderness; and they tested  God in a waterless place.

15. And he gave them  their request; he sent fullness unto  their souls.

16. And they provoked Moses to anger in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the lord.

17. [3opened 1The 2earth] and swallowed down Dathan, and covered over upon the congregation of Abiram.

18. And [2was kindled 1fire] in  their congregation; a flame burnt up the sinners.

19. And they made a calf in Horeb, and they did obeisance to the carving.

20. And they changed  their glory into a representation of a calf eating grass.

21. And they forgot the God, the one delivering them, the one doing great things in Egypt;

22. wonders in the land of Ham; fearful things at [2sea 1the red].

23. And he spoke  to utterly destroy them, unless Moses  his chosen one stood among the devastation before him,  to turn  his rage  to not utterly destroy them.

24. And they treated [3with contempt 2land 1the desirable]; they did not trust in his word.

25. And they grumbled in  their tents; they did not listen to the voice of the lord.

26. And he lifted up  his hand against them,  to throw them down into the wilderness;

27. and  to throw down  their seed into the nations, and to disperse them in the places.

28. And they were initiated to Baal-peor, and they ate a sacrifice of the dead.

29. And they provoked him in  their practices; and [3was multiplied 4among 5them 1the 2blow].

30. And Phinehas stood and made atonement, and [3was abated 1the 2devastation].

31. And it was imputed to him for righteousness, for generation and generation, unto the eon.

32. And they provoked him to anger at Water of Dispute; and evil was inflicted upon Moses because of them;

33. for they greatly embittered  his spirit, and he drew apart with  his lips.

34. They did not utterly destroy the nations which the lord told to them.

35. And they mixed among the nations, and learned  their works.

36. And they served  their carvings, and it became to them for a cause of offence.

37. And they sacrificed  their sons and  their daughters to the demons;

38. and they poured out [2blood 1innocent] -- the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the carvings of Canaan. And [3was polluted with murder 1the 2land] by their blood,

39. and it was defiled by  their works. And they committed harlotry by  their practices.

40. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] against  his people; and he abhorred  his inheritance.

41. And he delivered them into the hands of enemies, and [4dominated 5them 1the 2ones detesting 3them].

42. And [2afflicted 3them  1their enemies], and they were humbled under  their hands.

43. Many times he rescued them, but they greatly embittered him by  their counsel, and they were humbled in  their lawless deeds.

44. And the lord beheld in  their being afflicted while at the same time listening to  their supplication.

45. And he remembered  his covenant, and repented according to the magnitude  of his mercy.

46. And he gave them over for compassions before all the ones having captured them.

47. Deliver us, O lord  our God, and assemble us from out of the nations!  to acknowledge  [3name 1your  2holy];  to boast in  your praise.

48. Blessed be the lord  God of Israel, from the eon and unto the eon. And [4shall say 1all 2the 3people], May it be. May it be.

3. And from out of the places he gathered them; from the east, and west, and north, and the sea.

4. They wandered in the wilderness in a waterless way; [3a city 4for a home 1they did not 2find].

5. Hungering and thirsting,  their soul [2in 3them 1failed].

6. And they cried out to the lord in  their being afflicted, and from  their distresses he rescued them.

7. And he guided them in [2way 1the straight],  to go into a city of habitation.

8. Let them make acknowledgment to the lord  of his mercies, and  of his wonders to the sons  of men!

9. For he fills [2soul 1the empty]; and the soul hungering he filled up with good things;

10. even the ones sitting down in darkness and the shadow of death, being shackled in poorness and in iron;

11. for they rebelled against the oracles  of God; and the counsel of the highest they provoked.

12. And [2was humbled 3with 4troubles  1their heart]; they weakened and there was no  one helping.

13. And they cried out to the lord in  their being afflicted; and from out of  their distresses he delivered them.

14. And he led them from out of darkness and the shadow of death; and  [2their bonds 1he tore up].

15. Let them make acknowledgment to the lord  of his mercies, and  his wonders to the sons  of men!

16. For he broke the gates of brass; and the bars of iron he fractured in pieces.

17. He took hold of them from out of the way of their lawlessnesses; for on account of  their lawlessnesses they were humbled.

18. [3every 4food 2abhorred  1Their soul], and they approached unto the gates  of death.

19. And they cried out to the lord in  their being afflicted; and [3from out of  4their distresses 1he delivered 2them].

20. He sent  his word and healed them; and he rescued them from out of  their corruptions.

21. Let them make acknowledgment to the lord  of his mercies, and  his wonders to the sons  of men!

22. And let them sacrifice to him a sacrifice of praise! And let them declare  his works in exultation!

23. The men going down into the sea in boats, doing work in [2waters 1many];

24. these men beheld the works of the lord, and  his wonders in the deep.

25. He spoke, and [3is established 2wind 1the gale], and [2are raised up high  1its waves].

26. They ascend unto the heavens, and they go down unto the abysses;  their soul [2in 3evils 1melts away].

27. They were disturbed; they were shaken as the one being intoxicated, and all  their wisdom was swallowed down.

28. And they cry out to the lord in  their being afflicted; and [3from out of  4their distresses 1he leads 2them].

29. And he gave orders to the gale, and it stood as a breeze, and [2were quiet  1its waves].

30. And they were glad for they were stilled; and he guided them unto the harbor of their want.

31. Let them make acknowledgment to the lord  of his mercies, and  his wonders to the sons  of men!

32. Let them exalt him in the assembly of people, and [2in 3the chair 4of the elders 1let them praise him]!

33. He put rivers into a wilderness, and outlets of waters into a thirsty ground;

34. a ground bearing fruit into brine, from the evils of the ones dwelling in it.

35. He made a wilderness into lakes of waters; and [2ground 1a waterless] into outlets of waters.

36. And he settled there ones hungering, and they stood together cities of habitation.

37. And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, and they make fruit of produce.

38. And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly, and  [3their cattle 1he does not 2diminish].

39. And they were made few and were maltreated by the affliction of evils and grief.

40. [2was poured out 1Contempt] upon their rulers, and he wandered them in an untrodden place and no street.

41. But he helps the needy from out of poorness; and he made [2as 3flocks 1families].

42. [2shall see 1The upright] and be glad; and all lawlessness shall obstruct  its mouth.

43. Who is wise and will guard these things, and perceive the mercies of the lord?  

## Psalms 108

1.  The LORD Delivers His Beloved Ode of a psalm to David.  [2is prepared  1My heart], O God, [2is prepared  1my heart]. I shall sing and strum in  my glory.

2. Awake, O my glory! Awake, psaltery and harp! I will be awakened at dawn.

3. I will make acknowledgment to you among peoples, O lord; I shall strum to you among nations.

4. For great above the heavens is your mercy; and unto the clouds is your truth.

5. Be raised up high above the heavens, O God, and above all the earth with your glory!

6. so that [2should be rescued  1your beloved]. Deliver with your right hand, and heed me!

7.  God spoke in  his holy place. I shall be raised up high, and I shall divide Shechem into parts; and the valley of the tents I will measure out.

8. Mine is Gilead; and mine is Manasseh; and Ephraim is the assistance  of my head;

9. Judah is my king; Moab the kettle  of my hope; upon  Edom I will put  my sandal; [3to me 1the Philistines 2are submitted].

10. Who shall take me away into a city of a citadel? or who shall guide me to  Edom?

11. Is it not you, O God, the one thrusting us away? And will you not go forth, O God, with  our forces?

12. Give to us help from out of affliction, for [3is vain 1deliverance 2of man]!

13. In  God we shall execute power, and he shall treat [2with contempt  1our enemies].  

## Psalms 109

1.  The LORD Judges the Sinner To the director; a psalm to David.  O God  of my praise, you should not remain silent;

2. for the mouth of the sinner, and the mouth of the deceitful one [2against 3me 1opened]; they spoke against me [2tongue 1with a deceitful];

3. and with words of hatred they encircled me; and they waged war against me without charge.

4. Instead of the loving me, they slandered me; but I prayed.

5. And they placed against me bad things for good things; and hatred for  my affection.

6. Place [2against 3him 1the sinner], and let the devil stand at his right hand!

7. In  his being judged, may he go forth having been condemned; and  [2his prayer 1let] become as sin!

8. Let [2become  1his days] few, and  [4his overseeing 1may 3take 2another]!

9. Let [2become  1his sons] orphans, and  his wife a widow!

10. In being shaken up, let [2change residence  1his sons], and let them beg! Let them be cast out from  their areas!

11. Let [2search out 1the money-lender] all as much as exists to him, and let [2plunder 1strangers]  his toils!

13. Let [2be  1his children] given for devastation! In [2generation 1one] let [2be wiped away  1his name]!

25. And I became scorn to them; they beheld me; they shook their heads.

26. Help me, O lord  my God, and deliver me according to  your mercy!

27. And let them know that  [2your hand 1this is]! and you, O lord, did it.

28. They shall curse themselves, but you shall bless. The ones rising up against me, let them be ashamed!  but your servant shall be glad.

29. Let [4put on 1the ones 2slandering 3me] shame, and let them put [2around 3as 4a garment 1their shame]!

14. This is my rest into the eon of the eon; here I shall dwell, for I took her.

15.  Her game being a blessing, I shall bless;  her poor I will fill with bread loaves;

17. [2ears 1they have] and they shall not give ear; and neither is a breath in  their mouth.

18. [6likened 7to them 1May 5become 2the ones 3making 4them], and all the ones yielding upon them.

## Psalms 139

1.  The LORD Knows His Creation To the director; [2to 3David 1a psalm].  O lord, you tried me, and knew me.

2. You knew  my sitting down and  my rising up; you perceived  my thoughts from far off.

3.  My path and  my bent rush grass you traced; and all  my ways you looked out ahead.

4. For there is no deceit in my tongue. Behold, O lord, you knew all things;

5. the last and the former. You shaped me and put [2upon 3me  1your hand].

6. [4causes wonder 1The 2knowledge 3of you] in me; it was strengthened; in no way should I be able to attain it.

7. Where should I go from  your spirit? And from  your presence where should I flee?

8. If I should ascend into the heaven, you are there; if I should go down into  Hades, you are at hand.

9. If I may take up  my wings at dawn, and I should encamp unto the ends of the sea,

10. even there  your hand shall guide me, and [2shall hold 3me  1your right hand].

11. And I said, Surely darkness shall trample me; even the night was illumination for  my luxury;

12. for darkness will not be made darkness with you; and night as day shall be given light; as  its darkness, so also  its light.

13. For you acquired  of my kidneys; you took hold of me from out of the womb of my mother.

14. I will make acknowledgment to you, for fearfully you caused wonder; the wonders  of your works; and  my soul knows exceedingly.

15. [2were not 3hidden  1My bones] from you, which you made in secret; and  my essence in the lowermost parts of the earth.

16. [3my unfinished state 2saw  1Your eyes]; and on  your scroll all men shall be written. Days were shaped, and no one among them.

17. [5by me 1But 3exceedingly 4were esteemed  2your friends], O God, [3exceedingly 2were 4strengthened  1their beginnings].

18. I shall count them out, and above the sand they shall be multiplied; I awake, and still I am with you.

19. O that you should kill sinners, O God. O men of blood, turn aside from me!

20. For you will say concerning their thoughts, that they shall take [2in 3folly  1your cities].

21. Is it not the ones detesting you, O lord, that I detested? and against  your enemies I wasted?

22. In perfect hatred I detested them; [2as 3enemies 1they became] to me.

3. They sharpened their tongue as a serpent; the poison of asps is under  their lips. PAUSE.

4. Guard me, O lord, from the hand of the sinner! [3from 5men 4unjust 1Take 2me away] who reasoned  to trip up  my footsteps!

5. [2hid 1The proud] a snare for me; and [2lines 1they extended] for a snare for my foot; next to a road [2an obstacle 1they placed] for me. PAUSE.

6. I said to the lord, [2my God 1You are]. Give ear, O lord, to the voice  of my supplication!

7. O Lord, O Lord, the power  of my deliverance. You shadowed over  my head in the day of battle.

8. You should not deliver me, O lord, from  my desire unto the sinner. They argue against me. You should not abandon me, lest at any time they should be raised up high. PAUSE.

9. As for the head  of them encircling me, the trouble  of their lips shall cover them.

10. [4shall fall 5upon 6them 1Coals 2with 3fire]; you shall throw them down in miseries, and in no way should they stand.

11. [2man 1A talkative] shall not prosper upon the earth. [4man 3an unjust 1Evils 2shall hunt] unto corruption.

12. I know that the lord shall deal with the case of the poor, and the cause of the needy.

13. Besides, the just shall make acknowledgment to your name, and [2shall dwell 1the upright] with  your presence.  

## Psalms 141

1.  The Troubled Soul Cries Out A psalm to David.  O lord, I cried out to you. Listen to me! Take heed to the voice  of my supplication in  my crying to you!

3. Set, O lord, a watch for my mouth, and [2door 1a citadel] for  my lips!

4. And [2was discouraged 3within 4me  1my spirit]; [3within 4me 2was disturbed  1my heart].

7. Quickly listen to me! O lord, [2fails  1my spirit]. You should not turn  your face from me, so that I shall be like the ones going down into the pit.

10. Teach me  to do  your will! for you are  my God.  [3spirit 1Your  2good] shall guide me in [2land 1an upright].

13.  their storerooms are full, discharging forth from out of this one to that one;  their sheep are prolific, multiplying in  their streets;

14.  their oxen are thick; there is no ruined fence, nor stream, nor a cry in  their broad spaces;
