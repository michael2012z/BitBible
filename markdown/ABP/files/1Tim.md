# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1.  Paul's Exhortation to Teach Sound Doctrine Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the command of God the father, and our deliverer Jesus Christ, the one of our hope,

2. to Timothy genuine child in belief; favor, mercy, peace from God our father, and Jesus Christ  our Lord.

3. As I appealed to you to remain in Ephesus, going to Macedonia, that you should exhort some not to teach a different doctrine,

4. nor take heed to fables, and [2genealogies 1unlimited], which [2inquiries 1make for] rather than the administration of God, the one in belief.

5. But the end of the exhortation is love from out of a clean heart, and [2conscience 1a good], and [2of belief 1unpretentious];

6. which some having missed their aim, turn aside to useless discussion,

7. wanting to be teachers of the law, not comprehending what they say, nor concerning what they positively assert.

8. But we know that [3is good 1the 2law], if anyone [2it 3lawfully 1should treat];

9. knowing this, that for the just the law is not situated, but for the lawless and unsubmissive ones, impious and sinners, unholy and profane, murderers of one's father and murderers of one's mother, manslayers,

10. fornicators, homosexuals, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and if anything other  [2to healthy 3instruction 1is an adversary],

11. according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, which I was entrusted.

12. And [2gratitude 1I have] to the one empowering me -- [3Christ 4Jesus 1to 2our Lord], that [2trustworthy 1he esteemed me], appointing me to service;

13. I the formerly being blasphemous, and a persecutor, and arrogant. But I was shown mercy, for being ignorant I acted in unbelief.

14. [5more than superabounded 1But 2the 3favor  4of our Lord] with belief and love, the one in Christ Jesus.

15. Trustworthy is the word, and [2of all 3acceptance 1worthy], that Christ Jesus came into the world [2sinners 1to deliver], whom [2foremost 1I am].

16. And because of this I was shown mercy, that in me [4foremost 3should demonstrate 1Jesus 2Christ]  all leniency, for setting a pattern for the ones being about to believe upon him unto life eternal.

17. And to the king of the eons, incorruptible, unseen, only wise God, be honor and glory to the eons of the eons. Amen.

18. This  exhortation I place unto you, son Timothy, according to the [2going before 3over 4you 1prophecies], that you should soldier in them the good warfare,

19. having belief and good conscience; which some having thrust away concerning the belief made shipwreck;

20. whom are Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I delivered up  to Satan, that they may be corrected not to blaspheme.  

## 1 Timothy 2

1.  Pray for All Men I appeal then, first of all to make supplications, prayers, intercessions, thankfulnesses for all men;

2. for kings, and all of the ones [2in 3superiority 1being], that a calm and unassuming existence should be led in all piety and seriousness.

3. For this is good and worthy of being received before  [2our deliverer 1God];

4. who [2all 3men 1wants] to be delivered, and [2to 3full knowledge 4of truth 1to come].

5. For there is one God, and one mediator of God and of men -- the man Christ Jesus;

6. the one giving himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered [2times 1in its own];

7. to which I was established a herald and apostle (truth I speak in Christ, I do not lie) a teacher of the nations in belief and truth.

8. I want then [3to pray 1for the 2men] in every place, lifting up sacred hands, separate from anger and arguing. 

9.  Instructions to Wives Likewise also the wives in [2apparel 1composed] with respect and discreetness to adorn themselves, not in laces or gold or pearls or [2clothes 1very costly],

10. but what is becoming to wives promising godliness through [2works 1good].

11. [2a wife 4at 5rest 1Let 3learn] in all submission!

12. And a wife [4to teach 2not 1I commit 3to their care], nor to domineer a husband, but to be  at rest.

13. For Adam first was shaped, then Eve.

14. And Adam was not deceived, but the wife having been deceived, [2in 3violation 1has become].

15. But she shall be preserved through the childbearing, if they abide in belief, and love, and sanctification, with discreetness.  

## 1 Timothy 3

1.  Qualifications for Overseership Trustworthy is the word. If any [2overseership 1reaches for], [2a good 3work 1he desires].

2. It is necessary then the overseer to be unassailable, [2of one 3wife 1a husband], sober, discreet, composed, hospitable, qualified for teaching;

3. not intemperate in the use of wine, not a brawler, not profiting through vice; but lenient, not quarrelsome, not loving money,

4.  [4his own 5house 2well 1standing 3over], [2children 1having] in submission with all seriousness;

5. (and if any [3his own 4house 2how to stand over 1knows not], how [2the assembly 3of God 1shall he care for]?)

6. Not a novice, that not being deluded [2in 3judgment 1he should fall] of the devil.

7. But it is necessary for him also [3witness 2a good 1to have] from the ones outside, that [2not 4into 5scorning 1he should 3fall], and the snare of the devil. 

8.  Qualifications of Servanthood Servants likewise be serious, not double-talking, not [3wine 2to much 1attentive], not profiting through vice,

9. having the mystery of the belief with a clean conscience.

10. And these also let them be approved first, then let them serve being without reproach!

11. Wives likewise be serious, not slanderers, sober, trustworthy in all things.

12. Servants be [2of one 3wife 1husbands]! [2children 3well 1standing over] and their own houses.

13. For the ones [2well 1having served 5rank 6for themselves 4a good 3procure], and much confidence in belief, in the one in Christ Jesus.

14. These things to you I write hoping to come to you more quickly.

15. But if I should be slowed, that you should know how it is necessary [2in 3the house 4of God 1to behave], which is the assembly of the living God, column and base of the truth.

16. And confessedly great is the [2of the 3piety 1mystery]; God made manifest in flesh, justified in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among nations, believed in the world, taken up in glory.  

## 1 Timothy 4

1.  Confronting False Doctrine But the spirit expressly says, that in later times some shall leave of the belief, taking heed to spirits of delusion and instructions of demons;

2. in hypocrisy of speaking lies, [3being seared 1their own 2conscience],

3. restraining to marry, to be at a distance from foods which  God created for participation with thankfulness to the ones trustworthy and recognizing the truth.

4. For every creation of God is good, and nothing to be spurned, with thankfulness being received.

5. For it is sanctified through the word of God, and intercession.

6. In placing these things before the brethren, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, being trained up in the words of the belief, and the good instruction which you have followed closely.

7. But the profane and old wives fables refuse! But exercise yourself to piety!

8. For the bodily exercise for a little is beneficial,  but piety [2for 3all things 1is beneficial], [2promise 1having] of life -- of the present, and of the one being about to be. 

9.  The Christian Model Trustworthy is the word, and [2of all 3acceptance 1worthy].

10. [2in this 1for] also we tire in labor, and are berated, because we have hope upon a living God, who is deliverer of all men, especially ones believing.

11. Exhort these things and teach!

12. [2no one 4your  5youth 1Let 3disdain]! but [2a model 1become] for the ones believing -- in word, in behavior, in love, in spirit, in belief, in purity.

13. Until I come take heed to the reading, to the consolation, to the instruction!

14. Do not neglect the [2in 3you 1favor]! which was given to you through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the council of elders.

15. These things meditate upon! [2in 3these things 1Be], that your  progression should be apparent to all!

16. Give heed to yourself, and to the instruction! Remain in them! For this doing both yourself you shall deliver and the ones hearing you.  

## 1 Timothy 5

1.  Concerning Widows [4an elder 2not 1You should 3rebuke], but appeal to him as a father! younger men as brethren;

2. elder women as mothers; younger women as sisters, with all purity.

3. [2widows 1Esteem], the ones really widows!

4. And if any widow [2children 3or 4progeny 1has], let them learn first  [2for their own 3house 1to be pious], and [2a repayment 1to repay] to their precursors! for this is good and worthy of being received before  God.

5. And the one really a widow, and being left alone, has hope in  God, and remains in the supplications and in the prayers night and day.

6. But the one living extravagantly, while living, has died.

7. And these things exhort, that they should be unassailable!

8. And if any  [3of his own 4and 5especially 6of the ones 7of his family 1does not 2think beforehand], [2the 3belief 1he has denied], and is [2unbelieving 1worse than].

9. [3a widow 1Let 4be enrolled 2not 6less than 8years old 7sixty 5being 10of one 11husband 9a wife],

10. with [2works 1good] being witnessed, if she reared children, if she was hospitable, if holy one's feet she washed, if to the ones being afflicted she assisted, if every [2work 1good] she followed after.

11. And younger widows refuse; for whenever they should grow careless towards the Christ, [2to marry 1they want],

12. having judgment, because the first belief they disregarded.

13. And together also idly they learn to go around the houses; [2not 3only 1but] idle, but also in prating and useless works, speaking the things they must not.

14. I prefer then younger ones to marry, to bear children, to manage the home, not one opportunity to give to the adversary reviling favor.

15. For already some were turned aside after  Satan.

16. If any believing man or believing woman have widows, assist them, and do not weigh down the assembly; that [2the ones 3really 4widows 1it should assist]! 

17.  Concerning Elders [2the 4being well 5in charge 3elders 7of double 8honor 1Let 6be worthy], especially the ones tiring in the word and instruction!

18. [4says 1For 2the 3scripture], [3an ox 4threshing 1You shall not 2muzzle]. And, [3is worthy 1The 2worker]  of his wage.

19. [5against 6an elder 4a charge 1Do not 2welcome 3from outside], unless by two or three witnesses!

20. The ones sinning [2before 3all 1reprove], that also the rest [2fear 1should have]!

21. I testify before  God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that these things you should guard, separate from prejudice, nothing doing by inclination.

22. A hand quickly place upon no one! nor participate with sins of strangers! [2yourself 3pure 1keep]!

23. No longer drink water, but [3wine 2a little 1use] because of  your stomach, and  your frequent sicknesses!

24. Of some men the sins are exposed to view, leading before to judgment; but some also follow after.

25. Likewise also the good works are exposed to view, and the ones otherwise having taken place [3to be hid 1are not 2able].  

## 1 Timothy 6

1.  Concerning Masters As many [2as 3are 4under 5the yoke 1bondmen], [2their own 3masters 5of all 6honor 4worthy 1let them esteem]! that [7should not 1the 2name  3of God 4and 5the 6instruction] be blasphemed.

2. And the ones [2believing 1having] masters, let them not disdain them because they are brethren! but rather let them serve them, for they are believers and beloved ones, the ones [2of good works 1taking hold]! These things teach and appeal towards! 

3.  Concerning Unhealthy Doctrine If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and does not come forward with healthy words, the words  of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the [2according to 3piety 1instruction],

4. he is dulled, [2nothing 1having knowledge of], but diseased concerning inquiries and arguings over words, of which becomes envy, strife, blasphemies, [2opinions 1bad],

5. useless disputations [2corrupting 1of men] the mind, and depriving of the truth, to think revenue to be  piety -- separate from  such!

6. But there is [2revenue 1great] --  piety with sufficiency.

7. [3nothing 1For 2we have carried] into the world, and it is manifest that not even [2to bring forth anything 1are we able].

8. But having nourishment and shelters, with this we shall be sufficient.

9. But the ones wanting to be rich, they fall into the test and a snare, and [5desires 1many 2unthinking 3and 4hurtful], which submerge the men into ruin and destruction.

10. For a root of all the evils is the fondness of money, of which some reaching for were led astray from the belief, and pierced themselves on all sides [2griefs 1with many]. 

11.  Flee Evil and Pursue Good But you, O man  of God, flee these things! And pursue righteousness, piety, belief, love, endurance, gentleness!

12. Struggle the good struggle of the belief! Take hold of the eternal life! in which also you were called, and acknowledged the good acknowledgment offering before many witnesses.

13. I exhort to you before  God, of the one restoring to life all things, and Christ Jesus, the one witnessing unto Pontius Pilate the good confession;

14. for you to keep the commandment spotless, unassailable, until the grandeur  of our Lord Jesus Christ;

15. which [2times 1in its own] [6shall show 1the 2blessed 3and 4only 5mighty one]; the king of the ones reigning, and Lord of the ones dominating;

16. the one alone having immortality, [3light 1living in 2unrivaled excellent], whom [3beheld 1not one 2of man], nor [2to behold 1is able]; to whom is honor and [2might 1eternal]. Amen. 

17.  Advice to the Rich To the rich in the present eon, exhort to not be high-minded, nor to hope upon [2of riches 1the uncertainty], but in the living God, in the one furnishing to us all things richly for enjoyment;

18. to do good works, to be rich in [2works 1good], ready to share, to be sociable,

19. amassing for themselves [2foundation 1a good] for the time about to be, that they should take hold of the eternal life.

20. O Timothy, [2the 3deposit in your care 1guard]! turning aside from the profane idle talk, and oppositions of the falsely named knowledge;

21. which some promising concerning the belief, missed the aim. The favor be with you. Amen.
