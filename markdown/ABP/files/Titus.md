# Titus

## Titus 1

1.  Paul's Salutation to Titus Paul, a bondman of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ, for belief of the chosen of God, and full knowledge of truth, of the one according to piety;

2. unto the hope of life eternal, which [4promised 1the 3incapable of falsehood 2God] before times eternal,

3. but manifested [2times 1in his own] --  his word by proclamation, which I was entrusted with according to command  [2our deliverer 1of God].

4. To Titus genuine child according to our common belief. Favor, mercy, peace from God the father, and of the Lord Jesus Christ  our deliverer. 

5.  Elders Appointed For this favor I left you in Crete, that the things missing you should correct, and should place in every city elders, as I set in order for you to do.

6. If anyone is without reproach, [2of one 3wife 1husband], [3children 1having 2trustworthy], not with a charge of carnality, or unsubmissiveness.

7. For it is necessary the overseer to be without reproach, as God's manager; not self-willed, not prone to anger, not intemperate in the use of wine, not a brawler, not profiting through vice;

8. but hospitable, friend of good men, discreet, just, sacred, self-controlled,

9. holding to  [3according to 4the 5teaching 1the trustworthy 2word], that he might be able both to encourage in the [2teaching  1sound], and [2the ones 3disputing 1to reprove].

10. For there are many unsubmissive and vain talkers and mind-deceivers, especially the ones of the circumcision,

11. whom it is necessary to muzzle, who [2entire 3houses 1upset], teaching what they must not, [2of shameful 3gain 1for favor].

12. There said a certain one of them, [2of their own 1a prophet], Cretans continually are liars, evil wild beasts, [2bellies 1idle].

13.  This testimony is true; for which reason reprove them severely! that they should be sound in the belief,

14. not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, turning away from the truth.

15. All things indeed are pure to the pure; but to the ones being defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but [5are defiled 1even their  2mind 3and  4conscience].

16. God they acknowledge to know, but in the works they deny, being abominable and resisting persuasion, and [2to 3every 5work 4good 1rejected].  

## Titus 2

1.  Qualities of Christian Behavior But you speak what is becoming  for sound instruction.

2. Old men are to be sober, serious, discreet, being sound in the belief, in the love, in the endurance.

3. Old women likewise with [2character 1a consecrated], not slanderers, not [3wine 2to much 1being enslaved], teachers of virtue.

4. That [3are to be of a sound mind 1the 2young women], to be ones loving their husbands, ones fond of children,

5. discreet, pure, housekeepers, good, ones being submitted to their own husbands, that [5not 1the 2word  3of God 4should] be blasphemed.

6. The younger men likewise enjoin to be of a sound mind.

7. In all things [2yourself 1making] a model of good works, in  teaching, integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,

8. [2word 1sound], not open to condemnation, that the one at opposite should be ashamed, [2nothing 1having 5concerning 6us 4to say 3heedless].

9. Bondmen [2to their own 3masters 1are to be submitted], in everything to be well-pleasing, not disputing,

10. not pilfering, but [4belief 2all 1demonstrating 3good], that the teaching  [2our deliverer 1of God] should be adorned in all things.

11. [5appeared 1For 2the 3favor  4of God] -- the deliverance to all men,

12. correcting us, that denying  impiety and the worldly desires, sanely and righteously and piously we should live in the present eon,

13. awaiting the blessed hope and grandeur of the glory of the great God and our deliverer Jesus Christ;

14. who gave himself for us, that he should ransom us from all lawlessness, and should cleanse to himself [2people 1a prized], zealous of good works.

15. These things speak, and encourage, and reprove with all command! [2no one 4you 1Let 3speculate about]!  

## Titus 3

1.  Submit to Authorities Remind them! [2to sovereignties 3and 4authorities 1to submit], to yield obedience, [2for 3every 5work 4good 1to be prepared],

2. [2no one 1to 3blaspheme], to not be quarrelsome, but lenient, [2all 1demonstrating] gentleness to all men.

3. For we were at some time or other also ourselves unthinking, resisting persuasion, erring, being a slave to desires and [2satisfactions 1various], [2in 3evil 4and 5envy 1leading], odious, detesting one another.

4. And when the graciousness and the humane treatment appeared  [2our deliverer 1of God],

5. not from works  in righteousness which we did, but according to  his mercy he delivered us, through the bath of regeneration and renewal [2spirit 1of holy],

6. which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ  our deliverer;

7. that having been justified  by that favor, [2heirs 1we should be] according to a hope of life eternal. 

8.  Concerning Heresies Trustworthy is the word; and concerning these things I want you to positively assert, that [4should be thoughtful 6good 7works 5to be set over 1the ones 2trusting  3in God]. These are the good and beneficial things  to men.

9. But moronish inquiries, and genealogies, and strifes, and [2battles 1legal] stand off from! for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. A heretical man, after one and a second admonition, refuse;

11. knowing that [2is distorted  1such a one] and sins, being self-condemned. 

12.  Paul's Final Greetings Whenever I should send forth Artemas to you, or Tychicus, hurry to come to me in Nicopolis! for there I have decided to pass the winter.

13. Zenas the legal expert and Apollos diligently send forward! that nothing to them should be missing.

14. [2let 6learn 1But 3also 4the ones of 5ours 8good 9works 7to be set over] for the important needs! that they should not be unfruitful.

15. [5greet 6you 2the ones 3with 4me 1All]. You greet the ones being fond of us in belief!  Favor be with you all. Amen.
