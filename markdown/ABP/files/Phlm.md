# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1.  Paul Addresses Philemon Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon the beloved, and our fellow-worker,

2. and to Apphia the beloved, and Archippus  our fellow-soldier, and to the [2at 3your house 1assembly].

3. Favor to you, and peace from God our father and of the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I give thanks to my God, at all times [2mention 3of you 1making] at  my prayers,

5. hearing [3of yours 1the 2love], and the belief which you have towards the Lord Jesus, and to all the holy ones,

6. that the fellowship of the belief of yours [2active 1should become] in full knowledge of every [2work 1good], of the one in you in Christ Jesus.

7. [4gratitude 1For 2we have 3much] and comfort over  your love, because the feelings of compassion of the holy ones have been rested through you, O brother. 

8.  Paul's Appeal for Onesimus Therefore, [2a great 4in 5Christ 3openness 1having], to give orders to you, the thing related,

9. [3through 4the 5love 2rather 1I appeal], being such a one as Paul an old man, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

10. I appeal to you concerning  my child, whom I engendered in  my bonds, Onesimus,

11. the one at some time or other useless to you, but now [2to you 3and 4to me 1useful], whom I sent back to you.

12. But you ([2for him 1that is]) [2the things 3concerning my 4feelings of compassion 1receive]!

13. whom I wanted [2for 3myself 1to keep], that for you he should be serving to me in the bonds of the good news.

14. But without the help  of your opinion [3nothing 1I wanted 2to do]; that [4not 6as 7according to 8necessity  2good 1your 3should 5be], but as voluntary.

15. For perhaps on account of this he was separated for an hour, that eternally you should receive him;

16. no longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, [2brother 1a beloved], especially to me, and how much more to you, both in flesh and in the Lord.

17. If then you have me for a partner, receive him as me!

18. And if in anything he wronged you or owes, [2this 3to me 1charge]! 

19.  Philemon's Debt I, Paul, write in my hand. I will pay -- for I should not say to you that even yourself owes me besides.

20. Yes, O brother, [2I 4you 1may 3oblige] in the Lord; rest my  feelings of compassion in the Lord!

21. Relying upon  your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that even above what I say you will do.

22. But at the same time also prepare for me a guest room! For I hope that through  your prayers I shall be granted to you.

23. They greet you -- Epaphras,  my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus;

24. Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke,  my fellow workers.

25. The favor  of our Lord Jesus Christ be with  your spirit. Amen.
