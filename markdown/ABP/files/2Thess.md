# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1.  Endurance in Afflictions Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, to the assembly of Thessalonians, in God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

2. Favor to you, and peace from God our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. [2to give thanks 1We ought] to God at all times concerning you, brethren, as it is worthy, that [2is caused to grow exceedingly  1your belief], and [7is superabundant 1the 2love 4one 3of each 5of all 6of you] to one another;

4. so as for us ourselves [2in 3you 1to boast] in the assemblies  of God over  your endurance and belief in all  your persecutions and the afflictions which you endure;

5. a demonstration of the righteous judgment  of God, in the deeming you worthy of the kingdom  of God, for of which also you suffer;

6. if indeed it be righteous by God to recompense the ones afflicting you with affliction;

7. and to you the ones being afflicted, a relaxation with us, in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with angels of his power,

8. in fire of flame, giving punishment to the ones not knowing God, and to the ones not obeying the good news  of our Lord Jesus Christ;

9. ones who with punishment shall pay, [2ruin 1eternal] from the face of the Lord, and from the glory  of his strength;

10. whenever he should come to be glorified among  his holy ones, and to be marveled at by all the ones having believed (because [4was believed  1our testimony 2to 3you]) in  that day.

11. For which also we pray at all times for you, that you should be worthy of the calling  of our God, and should fulfill every good-pleasure of goodness, and work of belief with power,

12. so that [6should be glorified 1the 2name  3of our Lord 4Jesus 5Christ] in you, and you in him, according to the favor  of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.  

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1.  The Arrival of The Lord And we ask you, brethren, concerning the arrival  of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our assembling together unto him,

2. for  [2to not 3quickly 4be shaken 1you] of the mind, nor to be alarmed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as by us, that [5is present 1the 2day 3of the 4Christ]. 

3.  The Coming Defection Let not any completely deceive you in not one manner! for it will not be unless [3should come 1the 2defection] first, and [4should be uncovered 1the 2man  3of sin], the son  of destruction,

4. the one being an adversary and elevating himself above all being called god or object of worship; so as for him [2in 3the 4temple  5of God 6as 7God 1to sit], exhibiting himself that he is God.

5. Do you not remember that still being with you, [2these things 1I said] to you?

6. And now the one constraining you know, for the uncovering him in  his own time.

7. For the mystery [2already 3operates  1of lawlessness], only there is the one constraining just now until [2out of 3the midst 1he should be].

8. And then [3shall be uncovered 1the 2lawless one], whom the Lord shall consume by the breath  of his mouth, and shall render [4useless 1the 2grandeur  3of his arrival];

9. whose [2is  1arrival] according to the energy  of Satan in every power and signs and miracles of a lie,

10. and in every deception  of unrighteousness among the ones being destroyed, because of the love of the truth they received not for  them to be delivered.

11. And on account of this [2shall send forth 3to them  1God] an energy of delusion, for  them to believe in the lie,

12. that [11should be judged 1all 2the ones 3not 4believing 5in the 6truth 7but 8taking pleasure 9in  10unrighteousness].

13. But we ought to give thanks  to God at all times concerning you, brethren beloved by the Lord, that [2took you up  1God] from the beginning for deliverance in sanctification of spirit, and belief of truth,

14. in which he called you through  our good news in procurement of the glory  of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. So then, brethren, stand firmly and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word, or whether by our letter!

16. [5himself 1But  2our Lord 3Jesus 4Christ], and the God and our father, the one having loved us, and gave [2comfort 1eternal], and [2hope 1good] in favor,

17. may he comfort your  hearts, and support you in every [2word 3and 4work 1good].  

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1.  Paul's Exhortation For the rest pray brethren, for us, that the word of the Lord should run and should be glorified, as also to you;

2. and that we should be rescued from the unnatural and wicked men; [4is not 1for 5of all 2the 3belief].

3. But trustworthy is the Lord, who will support you, and will guard you from the evil.

4. But we rely in the Lord as to you, that in which we exhort unto you, both you are doing and will do.

5.  And may the Lord straighten out your  hearts in the love  of God, and in the endurance of the Christ.

6. And we exhort you, brethren, in the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to be in readiness from every brother [2disorderly 1walking], and not according to the tradition which he took to himself from us.

7. For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us; for we have not acted disorderly among you;

8. nor freely [2bread 1did we eat] from anyone, but in toil and trouble, night and day, working so as to not overburden any of you.

9. Not that we do not have authority, but that [2ourselves 3as an impression 1we should give] to you for the imitating us.

10. For also when we were with you, we exhorted this unto you, that if any does not want to work, neither let him eat!

11. For we hear some are walking among you disorderly, not working, but intermeddling.

12. And to such we exhort and appeal by  our Lord Jesus Christ, that [2with 3tranquility 1working],  [2their own 3bread 1they should eat].

13. But you, brethren, you should not tire doing good.

14. And if anyone does not obey  our word by  this letter, signify and do not intermingle with him, that he should be ashamed!

15. but not as an enemy esteem him, but admonish him as a brother!

16. [6himself 1And 3the 4Lord  5of peace 2may] give to you  peace continually in every manner. The Lord be with all of you.

17. The greeting  by my hand, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; so I write.

18. The favor  of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
