3. Concerning them, [2to 3your children 1describe], and  your children to their children, and  their children unto [2generation 1another]!

4. The things remaining of the caterpillar [3devoured 1the 2locust]; and the things remaining of the locust [3devoured 1the 2grasshopper]; and the things remaining of the grasshopper [3devoured 1the 2blight].

5. Sober up, O ones being intoxicated from their wine! Weep and wail all  drinking the wine unto intoxication! for it was lifted away from your mouth.

6. For a nation ascended upon  my land, one strong and innumerable.  His teeth [2teeth 1are as lion's], and  his molars as cubs.

7. He appointed  my grapevine for extinction, and  my fig-trees for a splinter. In searching he searched it, and tossed it down; he whitened  its branches.

8. Wail to me more than a bride being girded with sackcloth for the husband of her  virginity.

9. [4have been lifted away 1The sacrifice 2and 3the libation offering] from the house of the lord. Mourn, O priests!  ministers of the lord,

10. for [3languish 1the 2plains]. Mourn, O earth, for [2languishes 1the grain]! [2was dried up 1the wine], [2lessened 1the olive oil].

11. [2were withered 1The farmers]. Wail for your possessions, for the wheat and barley; for [2he has destroyed 1the gathering of crops] from out of the field!

15. Woe, woe, woe for the day, for [4is near 1the 2day 3of the lord], and as misery from misery, it shall come.

16. Were not [3in front of  4your eyes 1foods 2lifted away]? from out of the house of your God gladness and joy?

17. [2leap 1Heifers] in  their stables, [2are obliterated 1treasures], [2were razed 1wine vats], for [2was dried up 1the grain].

18. What shall we put aside for ourselves? [3weep 1The herds 2of oxen], for no [2exists 1pasture] to them; and the flocks of the sheep were obliterated.

19. To you, O lord, we shall yell. For fire consumed the beautiful things of the wilderness, and a flame incinerated all the trees of the field.

20. And the cattle of the plain look up to you, for [3were dried up 1the releases 2of waters], and fire devoured the beautiful things of the wilderness.

4. As a sight of horses so the appearance of them; and as horsemen so they shall pursue.

5. As the sound of chariots upon the tops of the mountains they shall leap, even as the sound of a flame of fire devouring stubble, and as [4people 1a vast 2and 3strong] being deployed for battle.

6. From in front of him [2shall be destroyed 1the people]; every face as a burnt earthen pot.

7. As warriors, they shall run; and as men of war, they shall ascend upon the walls; and each in  his way shall go, and no way shall they turn aside from  their roads.

11. And the lord shall give forth his voice from in front of his force; for [4great 2is 3exceedingly  1his camp]; for [2are strong 3works 1his words]; for great is the day of the lord, [2apparent 1exceedingly], and who will be fit for it?

And they shall say, Spare, O lord,  your people! and, You should not give  your inheritance unto scorn for the [2to rule 3them 1nations]; so that [4they should not 5say 1among 2the 3nations], Where is  their God? 

18.  The LORD Spares the Land But the lord was jealous  of his land, and spared  his people.

19. And the lord answered and said to his people, Behold, I shall send out to you the grain, and the wine, and the olive oil, and you shall be filled up of them. And I will not give you up any longer for scorning among the nations.

20. And the one from the north I will drive out from you, and I will push him into [2land 1a waterless], and I will obliterate  his face into the [2sea  1foremost], and the ones of his rear unto the [2sea  1latter]. And [2shall ascend  1his rottenness], and [2shall ascend  1his groaning], for he magnified  his works.

21. Be of courage, O land! Rejoice and be glad! for the lord magnified  to act.

22. Be of courage, O cattle of the plain! for [5have burst forth 1the 2plains 3of the 4wilderness]; for the tree bore its fruit; fig-tree and grapevine yielded their strength.

25. And I will recompense to you for the years which [3devoured 1the 2blight], and the grasshopper and locust, and the caterpillar, by [3force 1my  2great] which I sent out unto you.

28.  Spirit Poured Out And it will be after these things, I will pour out from  my spirit upon all flesh; and [4shall prophesy 1your sons 2and  3your daughters], and  your older men [2dreams 1shall dream], and  your young men [2visions 1shall see].

29. And even upon the manservants, and upon the maidservants, in  those days I will pour out from  my spirit.

30. And I shall execute miracles in the heaven, and upon the earth -- blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.

2. I will gather all the nations, and I will lead them into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will litigate with them there for  my people, and  my inheritance Israel, whom I dispersed among the nations, even the one [2my land 1who divided].

3. And [3over  4my people 1they cast 2lots]; and gave the boys to harlots, and [2the 3young women 1sold] for  wine, and drank.

4. And what are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Philistines? Do [4a recompense 1you 2recompense 3to me]? or [2have resentment 1do you] to me? Swiftly and quickly I will recompense  your recompense upon your heads;

5. because  [2my silver 3and  4my gold 1you took], and the chosen things of mine; the good things you carried into  your temples.

6. And the sons of Judah, and the sons of Jerusalem you rendered to the sons of the Greeks, so that you should push them from out of  their borders.

7. And behold, I will awaken them from out of the place of which you rendered them there; and I will recompense your recompense onto your heads.

8. And I will render  your sons and  your daughters into the hands of sons of Judah; and they shall render them into captivity, into a nation far at a distance, for the lord spoke.

9. Proclaim these things among the nations! Sanctify a war! Awaken the warriors! Lead forward and ascend all men of war!

10. Cut up  your plows into broadswords, and  your sickles into spears! Let the powerless say that, I am strong!

11. Gather together and enter all  nations round about! And gather together there! Let the gentle one be a warrior!

12. Awaken and ascend all  nations into the valley of Jehoshaphat! for there I will sit  to separate all the nations round about.

13. Send out sickles! for [3stands by 1the 2gathering of the crops]. Enter in! Tread! for [3is full 1the 2wine vat]. [3overflow 1The 2wine-vats], for [2are multiplied  1their evils].

15. The sun and the moon shall darken, and the stars shall let down  their brightness. 

16.  The LORD Will Spare His People But the lord [2from 3Zion 1shall shout aloud], and [3from out of 4Jerusalem 1shall utter 2his voice]. And [6shall be shaken 1the 2heaven 3and 4the 5earth], but the lord shall spare  his people, and shall strengthen the sons of Israel.

17. And you shall know that I am the lord  your God encamping in Zion, [3mountain 2holy 1my]. And Jerusalem will be holy, and foreigners  shall go through her no longer.

18. And it will be in  that day [3will trickle down 1the 2mountains] sweetness, and the hills shall flow milk, and all the releases of Judah shall flow waters; and a spring [2from out of 3the house 4of the lord 1shall come forth], and it shall water the rushing stream of the rushes.

19. Egypt [2for 3extinction 1will be], and  Edom for a plain of extinction, because of iniquities of the sons of Judah, because they poured out blood of the just in  their land.

20. But Judea [2into 3the 4eon 1shall dwell], and Jerusalem for generations of generations.

21. And I will require  their blood, and no way acquit. And the lord shall encamp in Zion.
