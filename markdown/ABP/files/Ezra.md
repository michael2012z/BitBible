2. Thus said Cyrus the king of the Persians, All the kingdoms of the earth [4gave 5to me 1the lord  2God  3of heaven]. And he looked upon me  to build to him a house in Jerusalem, the one in  Judea.

3. Who is there among you of all  his people, and [2will be  1his God] with him? Then let him ascend unto Jerusalem  in  Judea! And let him build the house of the God of Israel! He is the God  in Jerusalem.

4. And every Jew  being left from all the places of which he sojourned there, [3shall take up 4for him 1the men  2of his place]  silver and gold, and with belongings, and cattle, with the voluntary offering for the house  of God, the one in Jerusalem.

5. And rose up the rulers of the families  of Judah, and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites -- all which God awakened  their spirit  to ascend to build the house of the lord, the one in Jerusalem.

6. And all the ones round about them strengthened  their hands with items of silver, with gold, and with belongings, and with cattle, and with gifts, besides the ones with voluntary offerings.

## Ezra 3

1.  Israel Observes the Holidays And [4came 1the 3month  2seventh], and the sons of Israel were in their cities, and [3were brought together 1the 2people] as [2man 1one] unto Jerusalem.

2. And [5rose up 1Jeshua 2the 3son of 4Jozadak], and  his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and  his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel,  to offer upon it whole burnt-offerings according as written in the law of Moses, the man  of God.

3. And they prepared the altar upon  its preparation place, but  terror was upon them, because of the peoples of the lands. And they brought unto it the whole burnt-offerings, to the lord in the morning, and in the evening.

4. And they observed the holiday of the tents, according to the thing being written, and the whole burnt-offerings day by day in number, according to the distinguishing manner of the reckoning day by day for it.

5. And after this  [3whole burnt-offering 1the 2perpetual], and for the new moons, and for all holidays to the lord  were sanctified, and for every willing voluntary offering to the lord.

6. On day one of the [2month  1seventh] they began to offer whole burnt-offerings to the lord. But the house of the lord was not laid of a foundation.

7. And they gave money to the quarriers, and to the fabricators; and food, and drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians, and to the Tyrians,  to bring forth wood of cedars from  Lebanon by sea to Joppa, by the decree of Cyrus king of the Persians, concerning this.

8. And in the [2year  1second]  of their coming into the house of the lord  God, the one in Jerusalem, in [3month 1the 2second], [5began 1Zerubbabel 2the 3son of 4Shealtiel], and Jeshua the son of Jozadek, and the rest  of their brethren, the priests, and the Levites, and all the ones coming from the captivity into Jerusalem, and they established the Levites from twenty years and up,  to bring success upon the ones doing the works in the house of the lord.

9. And Jeshua stood and  his sons, and  his brethren, Kadmiel and  his sons, the sons of Judah over the ones doing the works in the house  of God; the sons of Henadad, their sons and  their brethren the Levites. 

10.  The Foundation of the House is Laid And [3laid a foundation 1the 2ones building]  to build the house of the lord. And [3stood 1the 2priests] being robed with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph with cymbals,  to praise the lord by the hands of David king of Israel.

11. And they answered in praise and confession to the lord, saying That he is good, that into the eon  is his mercy upon  Israel. And all the people shouted [2voice 1a great] in the praising the lord at the groundwork of the house of the lord.

12. And many from the priests, and the Levites, and rulers of the families -- the elders, the ones who beheld the [2house  1first] on its groundwork, and this  house with their eyes, wept [2sound 1a great], and many with a shout with gladness  to raise up high a sound.

13. And [4not 3were 1the 2people] recognizing the sound of the cheering  of gladness from the sound of the weeping of the people; for the people cried out [2sound 1with a great], and the voice was heard even from far off.  

## Ezra 4

1.  Opposition in Building the House of The LORD And [6heard 1the 2ones afflicting 3Judah 4and 5Benjamin] that the sons of the resettlement were building a house to the lord  God of Israel.

2. And they approached to Zerubbabel, and to the rulers of the families, and said to them, We should build with you, for as you, we also inquire to your God; and to him we sacrifice from the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, the one bringing us here.

3. And [2said 3to 4them 1Zerubbabel], and Jeshua, and the rest of the rulers of the families  of Israel, It is not for us and you  to build a house to our God, for we ourselves together shall build to the lord God of Israel, as [5gave charge 6to us 1Cyrus 2the 3king 4of the Persians].

4. And [5were 1the 2people 3of the 4land] enfeebling the hands of the people of Judah, and they impeded them  to build.

5. And they were hiring against them counselors  to efface  their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of the Persians, and unto the kingdom of Darius, the king of the Persians.

6. And in the kingdom of Ahasuerus, and in the beginning of his kingdom, they wrote a letter against the ones living in Judah and Jerusalem.

7. And in the days of Artaxerxes [2wrote 3in 4peace 1Mithridath], and Tabeel, with the rest of his fellow-servants to Artaxerxes king of the Persians. [3wrote 1The 2tribute-gatherer] the writing in Syrian and being translated.

8. Rehum the master and Shimshai the scribe wrote [2letter 1one] against Jerusalem  to Artaxerxes the king, saying,

9. Thus [3judges 1Rehum 2the master], and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of our fellow-servants, the Dinaites, Apharsathchites, Tarpelites, Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians, Susanchites, Dehavites, Elamites,

10. and the rest of the of the nations whom [7resettled 6Asnapper 1the 2great 3and 4the 5esteemed], and settled them in the cities  of Samaria, and the rest on the other side of the river. 

11.  The Letter to Artaxerxes This is the disposition of the letter which they sent to him -- To Artaxerxes the king.  By your servants, the men on the other side of the river.

12. And now [2be made known 1let it] to the king, that the Jews ascending from you to us came into Jerusalem the [4city 1defecting 2and 3wicked], which they are building; and the walls of it are being readied, and the foundations of it they elevated.

13. Now then let it be made known to the king, that if  that city should be rebuilt, and the walls of it should be readied, that tributes, tolls, and customs they shall not give, and this [2to kings 1does evil]!

14. And now [2not 3as 4salt 5of the 6temple 1we salted], and [4an indecency 5concerning the king 1it is not allowed 2for us 3to behold]. On account of this we sent forth and made known to the king;

15. that it should be examined in the book of memoirs  of your fathers; and you shall find in the book of the memorial, and shall know that  that city [2city 1is a defecting], and one doing evil to kings; and [8for places 9and 10flights 11for your runaway servants 7it is 1in 2the midst 3of it 4from 5the time 6of the eon]. On account of this,  this city was made desolate.

16. We make known then ourselves to the king, that if  that city should be built, and  its walls should be readied for these things, [3a part 4on 5the 6other side 7of the 8river 1there shall not be 2to you]. 

17.  Artaxerxes Responds And this then is the word which [3sent 1the 2king] to Rehum the master, and Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their fellow-servants of the ones living in Samaria, and the rest on the other side of the river, saying, Peace. And says the king,

18. The tribute-gatherer whom you sent to us was called before me.

19. And by me was rendered a decree, and they examined and it was found that  that city from days of the eon [2against 3kings 1lifts itself up], and defections and exiles take place in it.

20. And [2kings 1strong] were over  Jerusalem prevailing over all of the other side of the river. And [2tribute 3and tolls 1both] and customs were given to them.

21. And now establish a decree [3to cease work  2men 1for those], so that  that city shall not be built up any more!

22. So that of the decree [2guarding 1you were] you not be remiss to do concerning this, lest at any time [2should be multiplied 1an extinction of power] for an evil deed to happen to kings. 

23.  The Building Ceases Then the tribute-gatherer  of king Artaxerxes read in the presence of Rehum the master, and Shimshai the scribe, and his fellow-servants. And they went with diligence unto Jerusalem and to Judah, and they caused them to cease work with horses and a force.

24. Then [5was idle 1the 2work 3of the house  4of God], the one in Jerusalem. And it was idle until the second year of the kingdom of Darius king of Persia.  

## Ezra 5

1.  Construction Renewed under Darius King of Persia And [4prophesied 1Haggai 2the 3prophet], and Zechariah the son of Iddo, a prophecy over the Jews, of the ones in Judah and in Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, over them.

2. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jozadak, and they began to build the house  of God, the one in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets  of God to help them.

3. At that same  time there came upon them Tatnai chief ruler on the other side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and  their fellow-servants, and of such he said to them, Who ordained to you a decree  to build  this house, and  [2this expense 1to ready]?

4. Then they said to them, What are the names of the men  building  this city?

5. But the eyes  of God became upon the captivity of Judah, and they did not cause them to cease work until the decree  was carried to Darius. And then it was given to the tribute-gatherer concerning this.

6. The explanation by letter which was sent by Tatnai the chief ruler  on the other side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and  their fellow-servants -- Apharsachites, the ones on the other side of the river, to Darius the king. 

7.  The Letter of Opposition of Construction [2a word 1They sent] to him, and thus was written in it, To Darius the king, all peace.

8. Let it be known to the king! that we went into  Judea, the place for the house of the great God, and it is being built with the [2stones 1choice]; and timber is inserted in the walls, and  that work is fittingly done, and the way is prospering in  their hands.

9. Then we asked  those elders, and thus we said to them, Who rendered to you a decree  [2this house 1to build], and the bestowing of this expense to ready it?

10. And  [3their names 1we asked 2of them],  to make known to you, so as to write to you the names of the men of their rulers.

11. And such a word they answered to us, saying to us, We are menservants of the God of the heaven and of the earth, and we are building the house which was built [3before 4this 2years 1many], and [2king  3of Israel 1a great] built it, and readied it for them.

12. [2from 3when 1But 5provoked to anger  4our fathers] the God  of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and  this house he caused to rest, and the people he resettled in Babylon.

13. But in [2year  1the first] of Cyrus the king of the Babylonians, Cyrus the king rendered a decree  [3house  4of God 2this 1to build].

14. And the items of the house  of God, the ones of gold and silver, which Nebuchadnezzar brought forth from the house, of the one in Jerusalem, and carried them into the temple of the king, the one in Babylon -- [4brought them forth 1Cyrus 2the 3king] from the temple, of the one in Babylon, and gave them to Sheshbazzar, to the treasurer, to the one over the treasury.

15. And he said to him, These  items take and go! Put them in the house  in Jerusalem! And the house of God -- let it be built in  its place!

16. Then that Sheshbazzar came and put down the foundations of the house  of God, the one in Jerusalem. And from then until  now it is being built, and was not finished.

17. And now if for the king it seems good, let it be overseen in the house of the treasury of the king there in Babylon! so as to know that if from  king Cyrus [2was rendered 1a decree] to build the house  of God, that one  in Jerusalem. And [3knowing 1the 2king] concerning this, let him send forth a reply to us!  

## Ezra 6

1.  Darius Confirms the Construction Then Darius the king rendered a decree, and examined in the libraries, of which the treasuries were situated there in Babylon.

2. And there was found in Achmetha the city, in the palace of the Mede city, [2chapter of a scroll 1one], and this was [3written 4in 5it 1the 2 record].

3. In [2year 1the first] of king Cyrus, Cyrus the king rendered a decree concerning the house  of God, the one in Jerusalem, saying, [2the 3house 1Let] be built, and the place of which they sacrifice the sacrifices! And [2the 3foundations 1set], the height [2cubits 1of sixty], and the width of it [2cubits 1sixty],

4. and [2layers 4stones 3of fortified 1three], and [2layer 4timbers 3of new 1one]! And the expense [2out of 3the house 4of the 5king 1shall be granted].

5. And the items of the house  of God, the ones of gold, and the ones of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar brought forth from the house, of the one in Jerusalem, and carried into Babylon; even let them be given, and brought forth into the temple, of the one in Jerusalem, unto their place, and put them in the house  of God!

6. Now then Tatnai commandant of the other side of the river, Shethar-boznai, and  his fellow-servants the Apharsachites, the ones on the other side of the river, [2far 1be being 3from there].

7. And now leave alone the work of the house  of God, and the ones guiding of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews! [3house  4of God 2that 1Let them build] upon  its place!

8. And by me was rendered a decree  to do through the elders  of those Jews  to build [2house  3of God 1that], and from the subsistence of the king, of the tribute on the other side of the river, that carefully an expense be given  to those men  to not cease work!

9. And what ever deficiency -- both male offspring of oxen, and rams, and lambs for whole burnt-offerings to the God of the heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, olive oil, according to the word of the priests, the ones in Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day, unalterable, what ever they should ask!

10. That there might be a pleasant aroma offering to the God of the heaven, and they might pray for the life of the king, and  his sons.

11. And from me was rendered a decree, that every man who ever changes  this word [4shall be demolished 1the timber 2of  3his house], and a stake being straight up he shall be pitched upon it, and  his house will be for ravaging.

12. And the God of whom encamps with his name there, he shall eradicate every king and people who should stretch out  his hand to change and remove from view the house  of God, that one  in Jerusalem. I Darius rendered the decree. Carefully let it become!

13. Then Tatnai the chief ruler on the other side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and  his fellow-servants, in so far as [4sent 1Darius 2the 3king], thus they did carefully.

14. And the elders of the Jews built, and prospered at the prophecy of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo. And they rebuilt, and made ready by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of Persia. 

15.  The Dedication of the House of The LORD And they finished  this house by [2day 1the third] of the month Adar, which is in [2year 1the sixth] of the kingship of Darius the king.

16. And they made (the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the sons of the resettlement) a holiday of rededication of the house  of God with gladness.

17. And they offered for the holiday of rededication  [2house  3of God 1of this]; calves -- a hundred; rams -- two hundred; lambs -- four hundred; winter yearlings of the goats for a sin offering for all Israel -- twelve, for the number of the tribes of Israel.

18. And they established the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their distributions, for service of the house  of God, of the one in Jerusalem, according to the writing of the book of Moses.

19. And [5observed 1the 2sons 3of the 4resettlement] the passover on the fourteenth of the [2month  1first].

20. For [6were purified 1the 2priests 3and 4the 5Levites], [3as 4one man 1all 2were clean]. And they slew the passover for all the sons of the resettlement, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

21. And [4ate 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the passover -- the ones coming forth from the resettlement, and every one  separating themself of the uncleanness of the nations of the land that was theirs  to inquire of the lord God of Israel.

22. And they observed the holiday of the unleavened breads seven days with gladness; for [2gladdened 3them 1the lord], and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to fortify  their hands in the works of the house of the God of Israel.  

## Ezra 7

1.  Ezra the Scribe Teaches the Law And after  these things, in the kingdom of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, there ascended Ezra the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,

4. son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,

5. son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the [2priest  1foremost].

6. This Ezra ascended from out of Babylon; and he [2scribe 1was a quick] in the law of Moses, which [4gave 1the lord  2God 3of Israel]. And [3gave 4to him 1the 2king]; for the hand of the lord his God was upon him in all things which he sought.

7. And there ascended some from the sons of Israel, and from the priests, and from the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in [2year 1the seventh]  of Artaxerxes the king.

8. And they came to Jerusalem in the [2month  1fifth], this was the [2year 1seventh] of the king.

9. For on day one of the [2month  1first] he founded the expedition  from Babylon. And during the first day of the [2month  1fifth] he came into Jerusalem, for the hand of his God was good upon him.

10. For Ezra prepared  his heart to seek the law of the lord, and to do and to teach in Israel the orders and judgments.

11. And this is the copy of the edict which [4gave 1Artaxerxes 2the 3king] to Ezra the priest, to the scribe of the scroll of the words of the commandments of the lord, and his orders unto  Israel. 

12.  The Decree from Artaxerxes Artaxerxes king of kings, to Ezra the priest, scribe of the law of the God  of heaven. Let [5be initiated, 1the matter 2and 3the 4answer].

13. From me was rendered a decree, that all the ones willing in my kingdom from the people of Israel, and priests, and Levites, to go to Jerusalem -- with you let them go!

14. In so far as from in front of the king, and  [2seven 3counselors 1of his], one should be sent to look about over  Judea and Jerusalem, and in the law of their God in your hand,

15. to carry away even [4for 5the 6house 7of the lord 1silver 2and 3gold], which the king and the counselors were willing to give to the God  of Israel, to the one [2in 3Jerusalem 1inhabiting].

16. And all the silver and gold, whatever you should find in every place of Babylon, let it be offered with a voluntary offering of the people, and the priests, of the ones willing to give for the house of God, the one in Jerusalem.

17. And every one going [2this 3readily 1you arrange] by this scroll -- calves, rams, lambs, and their sacrifice offerings, and their libation offerings! And you shall offer them upon the altar of the house  of your God, of the one in Jerusalem.

18. And if anything [2with 3you 4and  5your brethren 1should seem good] with the rest of the silver and gold to do, as it pleases  your God, you do it!

19. And the items, the ones given to you for the ministration of the house of God, you deliver before God in Jerusalem!

20. And for the rest of the need of the house of your God, what ever should be apparent to you to give, you shall give from [3houses 2treasury 1the king's].

21. I Artaxerxes the king established a decree to all the treasuries, to the ones on the other side of the river, that all what ever he should ask of you (Ezra the priest and scribe of the law of the God  of heaven) readily let it become so!

22. Unto [3of silver 2talents 1a hundred], and unto [3of wheat 2cors 1a hundred], and unto [3of wine 2baths 1a hundred], and unto [3of olive oil 2baths 1a hundred], and salt of which the amount is not recorded.

23. All what is in the decree of the God of the heaven, let it become in the house of the God of the heaven! Take heed lest any make an attempt against the house of the God of the heaven! lest at any time [2should happen 1anger] upon the kingdom of the king, and  his sons.

24. And to you, let it be made known in respect to all the priests, and to the Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and ministers of the house of God! that this  tribute, and toll, and impost, [2do not have 1you] authority to assign upon them.

25. And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom  of God, the wisdom in your hand, ordain scribes and judges! that they might judge all the people, the people on the other side of the river, to all the ones knowing the laws  of your God. And to the ones not knowing you shall make it known.

26. And all who ever might not be observing the law  of God and the law of the king diligently,  judgment will be taken upon him, whether for death, whether  to root him out, or to instruct, or to penalize the subsistence, or for prison to lock up.

27. Blessed be the lord  God  of our fathers, who put it in the heart of the king thus,  to glorify the house of the lord, the one in Jerusalem.

28. And upon me [2leaned 1mercy] in the eyes of the king, and  his counselors, and all the rulers of the king of the mighty ones. And I was strengthened by the [2hand 3of the lord 4my God  1good] upon me, and I gathered from Israel rulers  to ascend with me.  

## Ezra 8

1.  Rulers of the Families of the Captivity And these are the rulers of their families, and the genealogy of the ones ascending with me, in the kingdom of Artaxerxes the king of Babylon.

2. Of the sons of Phinehas -- Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar -- Daniel; of the sons of David -- Hattush;

3. of the sons of Shechaniah of the sons of Pharosh -- Zechariah, and [3with 4him 5having traced descent 1the 2males] -- a hundred and fifty.

4. Of the sons Pahath-moab -- Elihoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred  males.

5. Of the sons Shechaniah -- son Jahaziel, and with him three hundred  males.

6. Of the sons of Adin -- Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty  males.

7. Of the sons of Elam -- Jeshaiaih son of Athaliah, and with him seventy  males.

8. Of the sons of Shephatiah -- Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty  males.

9. Of the sons of Joab -- Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred eighteen  males.

10. From the sons of Shelomith -- son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred sixty  males.

11. From the sons of Bebai -- Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight  males.

12. From the sons of Azgad -- Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him, a hundred ten  males.

13. Of the sons of Adonikam last, and these are the names of them -- Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty  males.

14. Of the sons of Bigvai -- Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy  males.

15. And I gathered them to the river, the one coming to  Ahava; and we camped there [2days 1three]. And I perceived among the people, and among the priests, [2any 3from 4the sons 5of Levi 1there were not] found there.

16. And I sent to Eleazar, to Ariel, to Shemaiah, and to Elnathan, and to Jarib to Elnatham, to Nathan, to Zechariah, to Meshullam, rulers; to Joiarib, and to Elnathan, ones perceiving.

17. And I gave charge to them to Iddo the ruler of Casiphia of the place. And I put in their mouths words to speak to Iddo, and to  their brethren of the Nethinim, of the ones with the money of the place Casiphia,  to bring to us ministers and singers into the house of our God.

18. And they came to us as the [2hand  3of our God  1good] was upon us, [2man 1with a discerning] from the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi  of Israel. And Sherebiah, and  his sons, and his brethren -- eighteen.

19. And  Hashabiah and  Jeshaiah from the sons of Merari, his brethren and his sons -- twenty.

20. And from the Nethinim, whom David appointed and the rulers for service of the Levites -- [3Nethinim 1two hundred 2twenty]; all these were named.

21. And I called there a fast at the river Ahava,  to humble ourselves before  our God, to seek by him [2way 1a straight] for us, and  for our children, and for all  our property.

22. For I was ashamed to ask from the king for a force and horsemen to deliver us from the enemy in the way; for we said to the king, saying, The hand  of our God is upon all the ones seeking him for good, and his might and his rage is upon all the ones abandoning him.

23. And we fasted and sought from  our God concerning this; and he heeded us.

24. And I separated [2of 3the rulers 4of the 5priests 1twelve], to Sherebiah, to Hashabiah, and with them from their brethren -- ten.

25. And I set before them the silver and the gold, and the items of the first-fruit of the house of our God, which [3separated in dedication 1the 2king], and  his counselors, and  his rulers, and all [3of Israel 1the ones 2being found].

26. And I set in their hands silver -- [3talents 1six hundred 2fifty], and vessels made of silver -- a hundred, and talents of gold -- a hundred;

27. and [2bowls 3of gold 1twenty 5drachmas 4of a thousand], and vessels of brass, shining, good quality, diverse, desirable as gold.

28. And I said to them, You are holy to the lord  God, and the [2vessels 1holy], and the silver, and the gold are a voluntary offering to the lord God  of our fathers.

29. Be awake and give heed until you set them before the rulers of the priests and the Levites, and rulers of the families  of Israel in Jerusalem, in the cubicles of the house of the lord!

30. And [6took 1the 2priests 3and 4the 5Levites] the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,  to bring them into Jerusalem into the house  of our God.

31. And we lifted away from the river  Ahava on the twelfth of the [2month  1first],  to come unto Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and he rescued us from the hand of the enemy, and the warlike people along the way.

32. And we came into Jerusalem, and we stayed there [2days 1three].

33. And on the [2day  1fourth] we set the silver, and the gold, and the vessels in the house  of our God into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad son of Jeshua, and Noadiah son of Binnui -- the Levites.

34. By number and by weight  all were measured; and [4was written down 1all 2the 3weight] at  that time.

35. And the ones coming out of the captivity, sons of the sojourn, brought whole burnt-offerings to the God of Israel; calves -- twelve for all Israel, rams -- ninety-six, lambs -- seventy-seven, winter yearlings of the goats for the sin offering -- twelve; the whole amount for whole burnt-offerings to the lord.

36. And they gave the mandate of the king to the administrators of the king, and chief rulers on the other side of the river; and they glorified the people, and the house  of God.  

## Ezra 9

1.  Breach-of-contract And as these things were finished, [2approached 3to 4me 1the 1rulers], saying, [4did not separate 1The 2people 3of Israel], and the priests and the Levites, from the peoples of the lands in  their abominations -- of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, and the Moserite, and the Amorite.

2. For they took of their daughters to themselves, and to their sons, and [4mixed together 3seed 1the 2holy] among the peoples of the lands; even by the hand of the rulers and of the commandants in  this breach-of-contract in rule.

3. And as I heard  this word, I tore  my garments and  my undergarment, and was agitated, and plucked the hair  of my head, and of  my beard, and sat down for calming.

4. And there gathered to me everyone  trembling at the word of the God of Israel concerning the breach-of-contract of the resettlement. And I was sitting calming myself until the [2sacrifice  1evening].

5. And during [3sacrifice 1the 2evening] I rose up from  my humiliation, and in  my tearing  my garments, and  my undergarment, and I leaned upon  my knees, and I spread forth  my hands to the lord  my God.

6. And I said, O lord, I am ashamed and feel shame  to raise up, O my God,  my face to you; for  our lawlessnesses multiplied over our head, and  our trespasses are magnified unto the heaven.

7. From the days of our fathers we are in [2trespass 1great] until  this day. And  in our lawless deeds we were delivered up, and  our kings, and  our priests, into the hand of the kings of the nations, by broadsword, and into captivity, and in seizure, and in shame of our face, as  this day.

8. And now as [5a little 3was lenient 4to us 1the lord  2our God],  to leave us for deliverance, and to give to us reliance in the place of his sanctuary,  to enlighten our eyes, and to give [2restoration to life 1a little] in  our servitude,

9. for we are servants, and in  our servitude [3did not 4abandon 5us 1the lord  2our God]; and he leaned [2towards 3us 1mercy] before the kings of the Persians,  to give us a restoring to life,  for them to exalt the house  of our God, and to reestablish  its deserted places, and  to give to us a fence in Judah and Jerusalem.

10. And now, what should we say, O our God, after this? For we abandoned  your commandments,

11. the ones which you gave to us by the hand  of your servants the prophets, saying, The land into which you enter there, to be an heir to it, [2a land 3in motion 1is] by the removal of the peoples of the lands of their abominations, which they filled it from mouth to mouth in their uncleannesses.

12. And now,  [3your daughters 1do not 2give] to their sons, and of  their daughters do not take to your sons, and do not require their peace and their good will into the eon! for you should grow in strength, and should eat the good of the land, and allot it to your sons unto the eon.

13. And after all the things coming upon us by our actions in the wicked things, and by [3trespasses 1our  2great], that you  our God lightened of us the lawless deeds, and gave to us deliverance;

14. for we turned to efface  your commandments, and allied by marriage to the peoples of the these lands. You should not be provoked by us unto consumption, so that there should not be one left over and preserved to us.

15. O lord  God of Israel, you are just, for we were left being preserved as  in this day. Behold, we all are before you in our trespasses; for there is no standing before you in this.  

## Ezra 10

1.  Ezra and Israel Cry Out to God And as Ezra prayed, and as he confessed weeping and falling before the house  of God, there came together to him from Israel [3assembly 2vast 1an exceedingly], men and women and young people; for [5weeping 4a great 3wept 1the 2people].

2. And answered one Shechaniah son of Jehiel, from the sons of Elam, and said  to Ezra, We broke contract with our God, and settled with [2wives 1alien] from the peoples of the land. And now there is hope to Israel for this thing.

3. And now we should ordain a covenant with our God, to lead out all the wives and the ones being born from them, according to counsel of the lord, and of the ones trembling in the commandments of our God. And [3according to 3the 4law 1let it be]!

4. Rise up, for [3concerns 4you 1the 2matter], and we are with you -- strengthen and do!

5. And Ezra rose up, and bound by an oath the rulers of the priests, and Levites, and all Israel,  to do according to  this word. And they swore by an oath.

6. And Ezra rose up from in front of the house  of God, and went into the treasury of Johanan son of Eliashib, and he lodged there; [3bread 1he did not 2eat], and [3water 1did not 2drink], for he mourned over the breach-of-contract by the resettlement.

7. And they carried about a report in Judah and in Jerusalem to all the sons of the resettlement,  to gather together in Jerusalem, saying,

8. Every one who ever should not come for three days, according to the counsel of the rulers and of the elders, [3shall be devoted to consumption 1all  2his substance], and he shall be separated from the assembly of the resettlement.

9. And [6gathered together 1all 2the men 3of Judah 4and 5Benjamin] in Jerusalem for the three days. And this was the [2month  1ninth]. On the twentieth of the month [4sat 1all 2the 3people] in the square of the house  of God in trembling concerning the matter, and because of the distress.

10. And [4rose up 1Ezra 2the 3priest], and said to them, You have broken the contract, and settled with [2wives 1alien],  to add to the trespass of Israel. 

11.  Ezra Orders the Dismissal of Alien Wives And now, give praise to the lord  God  of our fathers, and do the pleasing thing before him, and draw apart from the peoples of the land, and from the [2wives  1alien]!

12. And answered all the assembly [2voice 1with a great], and said, According to  your words which you said, thus we will do.

13. But the people are vast, and it is the time of winter, and there is no ability to stand outside, and the work is not for [2day 1one], nor two; for we multiplied the wrong in  this matter.

14. Let [3stand 1indeed  2our rulers]  in every assembly! and to all the ones in our cities who settled with [2wives 1alien], let them come at [2times  1arranged], and with them the elders city by city, and judges!  to turn the anger of the rage of our God from us, on account of  this matter.

15. Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahaziah son of Tikvah were with me; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite assisted them.

16. And [5did 6thus 1the 2sons 3of the 4resettlement]. And [4drew apart 1Ezra 2the 3priest], and the men rulers of the families of the households, and all by names, for they returned on day one of the [2month  1tenth] to inquire of the matter.

17. And they finished with questioning all the men  settling with [2wives 1alien] until day one of the [2month  1first].

18. And there were found of the sons of the priests, the ones settling with [2wives 1alien], some of the sons of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and of his brethren Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.

19. And they gave their hand in pledge  to bring forth their own wives; and they gave trespass offerings -- a ram of the sheep for their trespass offering.

20. And of the sons of Immer -- Hanani and Zebadiah.

21. And of the sons of Harim -- Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

22. And of the sons of Phasur -- Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, and Nathaneel, and Jozabad and Elasah.

23. And of the Levites -- Jozabad, and Shemei, and Kelaiah -- he is Kelita, and Pethahiah, and Judah, and Eliezer.

24. And of the singers -- Eliashib. And of the gatekeepers -- Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.

25. And of Israel, of the sons of Parosh -- Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.

26. And of the sons of Elam -- Mattaniah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

27. And of the sons of Zattu -- Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

28. And of the sons of Bebai -- Jehohanan, and Hananiah, and Zabbai, and Athlai.

29. And of the sons of Bani -- Meshullam, and Malluch, and Adaiah, and Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.

30. And of the sons Pahath-moab -- Adna, and Chelal, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Matthaniah, and Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

31. And of the sons of Harim -- Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,

32. Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

33. And of the sons of Hashum -- Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

34. And of the sons of Bani -- Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

35. Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

36. Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

37. Mattaniah, and Mattenai.

38. And so did the sons of Bani and the sons of Shimei,

39. and Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

40. and Machnadebai, and Sharai, and Shashai

41. Azareel, and Shelemiah, and Shemariah,

42. and Shallum, and Amariah, and Joseph.

43. From the sons of Nebo -- Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, Joel, and Benaiah.

44. All these took [2wives 1alien]; and also there are of them [2of the 3wives 4in which 5they engendered 6of 7them 1sons].
