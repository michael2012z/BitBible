# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1.  The Vision against Judea and Jerusalem The vision which [4beheld 1Isaiah 2son 3of Amoz], which he beheld against  Judea, and against Jerusalem, during the kingdom of Uzziah, and Jotham, and Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the ones who reigned over  Judea.

2. Hear, O heaven, and give ear O earth! For the lord spoke, saying, [2sons 1I have engendered], and raised them, but they disregarded me.

3. [2knows 1The ox] the one acquiring it, and the donkey knows the stable  of its master; but Israel [3me 1does not 2know], and  my people perceived not.

4. Woe, [2nation 1O sinful], people full of sins, [2seed 1an evil], [2sons 1lawless]. You abandoned the lord, and provoked to anger the holy one  of Israel; they were separated into the rear.

5. Why still should you be struck, proceeding in lawlessness? The whole head is in misery, and the whole heart is in distress.

6. From feet unto head there is no [2in 3it 1wholeness]. Neither wound, nor stripe, nor [2wound 1inflamed] are healed; there is no dressing to place upon it, nor oil, nor bandages.

7.  Your land is desolate;  your cities scorched;  your place before you -- strangers devoure it, and it is made desolate, being eradicated by [2peoples 1alien].

8. [4shall be abandoned 1The 2daughter 3of Zion] as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse in a cucumber garden, as a city being assaulted.

9. And unless the lord of Hosts left us a seed, [2as 3Sodom 1we would have become], and [2as 3Gomorrah  1likened].

10. Hear the word of the lord, O rulers of Sodom! Take heed to the law of our God, O people of Gomorrah!

11. What are [3to me 1the multitude  2of your sacrifices], says the lord? I am full of whole burnt-offerings of rams, and fat of lambs; and [3blood 4of bulls 5and 6he-goats 1I do not 2want].

12. And neither should you come to appear to me; for who required these from out of  your hands? [3to tread  4my courtyard 1You shall not 2proceed].

13. If you should bring fine flour, it is in vain; incense [2an abomination 3to me 1is];  [3your new moons 4and 5the 6Sabbaths 7and 9day 8the great 1I cannot 2endure].

14. Your fasting, and idleness, and  your new moons, and  your holidays [3detests  2soul 1my]. You became to me as a glut; no longer shall I spare  your sins.

15. Whenever you should stretch out your hands, I shall turn  my eyes from you. And if you should multiply  your supplication, I will not listen to you,  for your hands [2of blood 1are full].

16. Bathe yourself! [2clean 1Become]! Remove the wickednesses from  your souls before  my eyes! Cease from  your wickednesses!

17. Learn [2good 1to do]! Inquire of equity! Rescue the one wronged! Judge for the orphan! and do justice for the widow!

18. And come, we should plead, says the lord. And if [2should be  1your sins] as crimson, [2as 3snow 1I shall whiten]; and if they should be as scarlet, [2as 3wool 1I shall whiten].

19. And if you should want, and if you should listen to me, [2the 3good things 4of the 5earth 1you shall eat].

20. But if you should not want, nor should you listen to me, a sword [2you 1shall devour]. For the mouth of the lord spoke these things. 

21.  Zion the Harlot City O how [4became 5a harlot 2city 1the trustworthy 3Zion], full of judgment; in which righteousness slept in it, but now murderers.

22.  Your silver is debased;  your peddlers mingle the wine with water.

23.  Your rulers resist persuasion, they are partners of thieves, loving bribes, pursuing recompense, [3for orphans 1not 2arbitrating], and [3equity 4of widows 1not 2heeding].

24. On account of this, thus says the master, the lord of Hosts, Woe the ones being strong of Israel, [4will not 5cease 1for 2my  3rage] among the contrary ones, and [2judgment 3on  4my enemies 1I will execute].

25. And I will bring  my hand against you, and I will purify you to cleanness. But the ones resisting persuasion I will destroy, and I will remove all lawless ones from you.

26. And all the proud I will abase; and I will stand  your judges as  formerly, and  your counselors as  at the beginning. And after these things you shall be called, City of Righteousness, [2mother-city 1the trustworthy] Zion.

27. For with judgment [2shall be delivered  1her captivity], and with charity.

28. And [6shall be broken 1the 2lawless ones 3and 4the 5sinners] together; and the ones abandoning the lord shall be finished off entirely.

29. For they shall be ashamed of  their idols, which they preferred; and they shall be ashamed over the gardens which they desired.

30. For they will be as a terebinth tree throwing off  its leaves, and as a park [3water 1not 2having].

31. And [2will be  1their strength] as the stubble of hemp; and  their works as sparks, and [6shall be incinerated 1the 2lawless ones 3and 4the 5sinners] together, and there will not be one extinguishing.  

## Isaiah 2

1.  The Word Concerning the Last Days The word  coming to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning  Judea, and concerning Jerusalem.

2. For it will be in the last days [4will be apparent 1the 2mountain 3of the lord], and the house  of God will be upon the uppermost part of the mountains, and it shall be raised up high above the hills; and [4shall come 5unto 6it 1all 2the 3nations].

3. And [3shall go 2nations 1many] and shall say, Come, for we should ascend unto the mountain of the lord, and unto the house of the God of Jacob; and he will announce to us  his way; and we shall go in it. For from out of Zion shall come forth law, and the word of the lord from out of Jerusalem.

4. And he shall judge in the midst of the nations; and he shall completely refute [2people 1many]. And they shall cut down  their swords into plows, and  their pikes into sickles. And [2shall not 3take 1a nation 5against 6a nation 4a sword], and in no way should they learn yet to wage war. 

5.  The Day of The LORD And now, O house  of Jacob, come and we should go to the light of the lord.

6. For he forsook  his people, the house  of Jacob; for [2was filled up 3as  4from 5the beginning  1their place] of ones prognosticating, as that of the Philistines; and [3children 1many 2Philistine] were born to them.

7. For they filled up  their place with silver and gold, and there was no limit to the number  of their treasures; and they filled up the land with horses, and there was no limit to the number  of their chariots.

8. And they filled up the land with the abominations of the works  of their hands; and they did obeisance to the ones which they made  by their fingers.

9. And [2bowed 1people], and [2was abased 1each man]; and in no way will I spare them.

10. And now, enter to the rock, and hide in the earth from in front of the fear of the lord, and from the glory  of his strength, whenever he should rise up to devastate the earth!

11. For the eyes of the lord are high,  but man is low; and [4shall be abased 1the 2height  3of men], and [3shall be raised up high 1the lord 2alone] in  that day.

12. For the day of the lord of Hosts is upon every one insulting and proud; and upon every one high and elevated -- and they shall be abased;

13. and upon every cedar  of Lebanon, of the ones high and elevated; and upon every [2tree 1acorn] of Bashan;

14. and upon every high mountain; and upon every [2hill 1high];

15. and upon every [2tower 1high]; and upon every [2wall 1high];

16. and upon every boat of the sea; and upon every spectacle of boats of beauty.

17. And [3shall be abased 1every 2man]; and [4shall fall 1the 2haughtiness  3of men]; and [3shall be raised up high 1the lord 2alone] in  that day.

18. And [3the things 4made by hand 2all 1they shall hide],

19. carrying them into the caves, and into the fissures of the rocks, and into the burrows of the earth, from in front of the fear of the lord, and from the glory  of his strength, whenever he should rise up to devastate the earth.

20.  For that day [2will cast out 1a man]  his abominations, the things made of silver and  gold which they made to do obeisance to the vain things, and to the bats,

21.  to enter into the burrows of the solid rock, and the fissures of the rocks, from in front of the fear of the lord, and from the glory  of his strength, whenever he should rise up to devastate the earth.

22. Cease yourself from the man  breathing by his nostril; for by what is he considered?  

## Isaiah 3

1.  Judgment on Judea's Leadership Behold, indeed the master, the lord of Hosts, he shall remove from Jerusalem and from  Judea the prevailing man and prevailing woman; the strength of bread and the strength of water;

2. the giant and the one prevailing, and a man warrior, and magistrate, and prophet, and thinker, and old man,

3. and commander of fifty, and wonderful counselor, and wise architect, and discerning listener.

4. And I will set young men as their rulers; and mockers will lord over them.

5. And [3will be downcast 1the 2people]; man against man, even a man will be against  his neighbor; [3will strike 1the 2boy] against the old man; the one without honor against the important.

6. For [2shall take hold of 1a man]  his brother, or  a member of the family  of his father, saying, [2a garment 1You have], [3chief 1you become 2our]; and  [3food needs  2my 5under 6you 1let 4be]!

7. And answering in  that day, he will say, I will not be your chief, [3no 1for 5in  6my house 2there is 4bread], nor a garment; I will not be a chief  of this people.

8. For Jerusalem is forsaken, and  Judea is cast down, and  their tongues speak with lawlessness the things against the lord, resisting persuasion.

9. Because now [2was abased  1their glory], and the shame  of their face withstood them,  and [2their sin 3as 4Sodom 1they announced], and revealed it. Woe  to their soul, because they consulted [2counsel 1wicked] against themselves;

10. having said, We should bind the just, for [2inconvenient 3to us 1he is]; therefore the produce  of their works they shall eat.

11. Woe to the lawless one; evils according to the works  of his hands shall come to pass against him.

12. O my people,  your exactors glean you, and the ones exacting lord over you; O my people, the ones declaring you blessed mislead you, and [2the 3roads  4of your feet 1they disturb].

13. But now [2will place 3in 4judgment 1the lord], and will stand [2in 3judgment  1his people].

14. The lord himself [2for 3judgment 1shall come] with the elders of the people, and with  his rulers. But you, why did you set on fire  my vineyard, and the seizure of the poor is in  your houses?

15. Why do you wrong  my people, and [2the 3face 4of the 5poor 1disgrace], says the lord, the Lord of the militaries? 

16.  Judgment on the Daughters of Zion Thus says the lord, Because [4are haughty 1the 2daughters 3of Zion], and they go with a high neck, and with the beckon of the eyes, and their goings  with their feet together, dragging their inner garments, and their feet [2together 1playing];

17. therefore [2will abase 1the lord] the ruling daughters of Zion; and the lord will uncover  their condition.

18. In  that day even the lord will remove the glory  of their clothes, and the fringes, and the crescents,

19. and the necklace, and the ornament  of their face,

20. and the array of the ornament  of glory, and the armlets, and the bracelets, and the wreaths, and the rings, and the right armbands,

21. and the ear-rings, and the objects edged with purple, and the purple ornamentations,

22. and the cloths for the house, and the transparencies of Lakonika,

23. and the fine linens, and the ones of blue, and scarlet, and the linen [2with 3gold 4and 5blue 1being interwoven], and the lightweight coverings for divans.

24. And there will be [2instead of 4scent 3an agreeable 1a cloud of dust]; and instead of a belt, [2with a rough cord 1you shall tie around]; and instead of the [2ornament 3for the 4head  1gold], [2baldness 1you shall have] on account of  your works; and instead of the inner garment  of purple ornamentation, you shall gird on sackcloth.

25. And  [3son 1your  2best] whom you love [2by the sword 1shall fall]; and  your strong ones [2by the sword 1shall fall], and they shall be abased.

26. And [4shall mourn 1the 2cases  3of your ornamentation]; and you shall be left behind alone; and into the earth you shall be dashed.  

## Isaiah 4

1.  Renewal of Zion And [3shall take hold of 1seven 2women 5man 4one] in that  day, saying,  [2our own bread 1We will eat] and  [2our own garments 1wear], only  [2your name 1let] be called upon us; remove  our scorn!

2. In  that day [2shall shine forth  1God] in counsel with glory upon the earth  to exalt and to glorify the one left behind  of Israel.

3. And it shall be the one left behind in Zion, and the one left behind in Jerusalem [2holy 1shall be called]; all the ones being written for life in Jerusalem.

4. For [2shall thoroughly wash 1the lord] the filth of the sons and the daughters of Zion; and [2the 3blood 4of Jerusalem 1he shall clear out] from its midst by a spirit of judgment, and a spirit of burning.

5. And he shall come, and it will be that every place  of mount Zion, and all the places surrounding it he shall shadow with a cloud by day, and as smoke and the light of fire burning by night; all the glory shall be sheltered.

6. And it will be for a shade from sweltering heat, and for protection, and for a concealment from the hardness of weather and rain.  

## Isaiah 5

1.  Parable of the Vineyard I will sing indeed to the one being loved of me a song  of my beloved concerning his vineyard. A vineyard became to the one being loved on a horn in [2place 1a plentiful].

2. And [2a barrier 1I put] around it, and I built a palisade, and planted a grapevine, a choice vine; and I built a tower in the midst of it; and [2a wine press 1I dug] in it; and I waited  for it to produce the grape, and it produced thorn-bushes.

3. And now, O ones dwelling in Jerusalem, and O man  of Judah, judge then  [2me 3and 1between]  my vineyard!

4. What shall I do still to my vineyard that I did not do to it? For I waited  for it to produce a grape, but it produced thorn-bushes.

5. Now then I will announce to you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove  its barrier, and it will be for ravaging. And I will demolish  its wall, and it will be for trampling.

6. And I will forsake  my vineyard; for in no way should it be pruned, neither shall it be dug. And [2shall ascend 3into 4it 5as 6in 7an uncultivated land 1the thorn-bush]. And [2to the 3clouds 1I will give charge]  to not rain [2upon 3it 1any rain].

7. For the vineyard of the lord of Hosts [2the house  3of Israel 1is], and the man  of Judah is the newly planted one being loved. I waited  for it to produce equity, but it produced lawlessness; and not righteousness, but a cry.

8. Woe to the ones joining together house to house, and [2field 3to 4field 1nearing], that  [3of their neighbor 1they should remove 2anything]; will you not live alone upon the land?

9. For it was heard in the ears of the lord of Hosts about these things. For even if there should become [2residences 1many] in desolation, and they shall be great and good, but there will not be  ones dwelling in them.

10. For where [4work 1ten 2teams 3of oxen] the land will produce [2clay vessel 1one]; and the one sowing [2large measures 1six] shall produce [2measures 1three]. 

11.  Woe to the Sinner Woe to the ones arising in the morning and  [2liquor 1pursuing]; the ones waiting  late for it; for the wine shall burn with them.

12. For with the harp, and psaltery, and tambourines, and pipes,  [2wine 1they drink]; but the works of the lord they do not look at, and the works  of his hands they do not contemplate.

13. Therefore [3captive  1my people 2became] because of  [2not 3knowing 1their] the lord. And a multitude became dead because of hunger and thirst for water.

14. And [2widened  1Hades]  its breath, and opened wide  its mouth  to not stop. And [3shall go down 1the 2honorable ones], and the great, and the rich, and the one exalting in her.

15. And [2shall be abased 1a people], and [2shall be dishonored 1a man], and the [2eyes  1elevated] shall be abased.

16. And [3shall be raised up high 1the lord 2of Hosts] in judgment; and the [2God  1holy] shall be glorified in righteousness.

17. And [3shall be grazed 1the ones 2tearing in pieces] as bulls; and [3the things 4of the barren places 5of the ones 6being taken away 1lambs 2shall eat].

18. Woe to the ones drawing  sins as with [2rough cord 1a long], and [2as with 3a yoke 4strap 5of a heifer  1lawlessnesses.]

19. The ones saying,  Let him quickly approach to do whatever! that we should see it; and let [6come 1the 2counsel 3of the 4holy one 5of Israel]! that we should know it.

20. Woe to the ones calling  evil good, and  good evil; the ones making the darkness light, and the light darkness; the ones making the bitter sweet, and the sweet bitter.

21. Woe to the ones wise to themselves, and [2before 3themselves 1having knowledge].

22. Woe to your strong ones, the ones drinking  wine, and the mighty ones, the ones mixing  liquor;

23. the ones justifying the impious because of bribes, and [3for the 4just  2justice 1lifting away].

24. On account of this, in which manner [2shall be burnt 1stubble] by a coal of fire, and shall be burnt up by a flame being sent up,  their root [2as 3dust 1will be], and  their flower [2as 3a cloud of dust 1shall ascend]; for they did not want the law of the lord of Hosts; but the oracle of the holy one of Israel they provoked.

25. And [3was enraged 4in anger 1the lord 2of Hosts] against  his people. And he put  a hand against them, and he struck them. And [3were provoked 1the 2mountains], and [2became  1their decaying flesh] as dung in the midst of the way. And in all these [2was not 3turned  1his rage], but still  his hand is high.

26. Accordingly he shall lift up an agreed upon sign among the nations  far off; and he shall whistle at them from the uttermost part of the earth; and behold, quickly nimbly they come.

27. They shall not hunger nor tire, nor shall they slumber nor shall they go to sleep, nor shall they untie  their belts from  their loins, nor shall they tear away the straps  of their sandals;

28. whose  arrows are sharp, and  their bows being stretched tight; the feet  of their horses [2as 3solid 4rock 1are considered]; the wheels  of their chariots as a blast.

29. They advance as lions, and stand beside as [2cubs 1lion]; and he shall take hold and shall yell as a wild beast, and he shall cast them out, and there will not be  one rescuing them.

30. And he shall yell on account of them  in that day, as the sound of the sea swelling up. And they shall look into the heaven upward and below; and behold, [2darkness 1a hard] in  their perplexity.  

## Isaiah 6

1.  The Throne of The LORD And it came to pass the year of which [3died  1king 2Uzziah], I beheld the lord sitting upon [2throne 1a high], and being lifted up; and [3was full 1the 2house]  of his glory.

2. And seraphim stood round about him; six wings to the one, and six wings to the other one. And with the first two they covered up the front; and with the second two they covered up the feet; and with the third two they flew.

3. And they cried out another to  another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the lord of Hosts; [4is full 1all 2the 3earth]  of his glory.

4. And [3lifted up 1the 2lintel] from the sound of which they cried out, and the house was filled up of smoke.

5. And I said, O, I am miserable, for I am vexed, for [2a man 1being] and [2unclean 3lips 1having] in the midst of a people [2unclean 3lips 1having] I live in. And the king, the lord of Hosts, I beheld with my eyes.

6. And [4was sent 5to 6me 1one 2of the 3seraphim]. And in the hand he had a coal, which [5with the 6tong 1he took 2from 3the 4altar].

7. And he touched  my mouth, and he said, Behold, this touched  your lips, and [2it shall remove  1your lawless deeds], and  [2your sins 1it shall purge]. 

8.  Isaiah Sent And I heard the voice of the lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who shall go to  this people? And I said, Behold, I am, send me!

9. And he said, Go! and say  to this people, Hearing, you shall hear, but in no way shall you perceive; and seeing you shall see, but in no way shall you know.

10. [5was thickened 1For 2the 3heart  4of this people]; and  [3with their ears 2heavily 1they heard], and the eyes closed eyelids, lest at any time they should behold with their eyes, and the ears should hear, and the heart should perceive, and they should turn, and I shall heal them.

11. And I said, Until when, O lord? And he said, Until whenever [2should be made desolate 1cities] by  not being dwelt in; and houses by reason of  not being men; and the land shall be left desolate.

12. And after these things [2shall distance  1God] the men; and [6shall be multiplied 1the 2ones being left behind 3upon 4the 5land].

13. But still upon it is the tenth part, and again it will be for plunder. As a terebinth tree, and as an acorn whenever it should fall from out of  its casing -- [2seed 1the holy]  is its pillar.  

## Isaiah 7

1.  War Waged against Jerusalem And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah king of Judah, ascended Rezin king of Aram, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, against Jerusalem to wage war with it, and they were not able to assault it.

2. And it was announced in the house of David, saying, [2joined in harmony 1Aram] to  Ephraim. And it startled  his soul, and the soul  of his people, in which manner [2in 3a grove 1a tree 5by 6a wind 4is shaken].

3. And the lord said to Isaiah, Go forth to meet with Ahaz, you and the one being left behind, Jasub  your son, to the [2pool  1upper] by way of the field of the fuller.

4. And you shall say to him, Guard  to be still, and do not fear! nor  your soul be weak from the two trees  [2firebrands,  1of these smoking]; for whenever the anger  of my rage takes place, again I will heal.

5. And as far as the son  of Aram, and the son  of Remaliah, that they consulted [2counsel 1wicked], saying,

6. We shall ascend unto  Judea, and conversing together with them, we shall turn them to us, and we will give to reign over them the son of Tabeal.

7. Thus says the lord of Hosts, In no way should [2abide  1this counsel], nor will it be so.

8. But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; but yet sixty and five years [4will fail 1the 2kingdom 3of Ephraim] from the people.

9. And the head of Ephraim, is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son  of Remaliah. And if you should not trust, neither should you perceive. 

10.  Immanuel And the lord proceeded to speak  to Ahaz, saying,

11. Ask for yourself a sign by the lord your God, in the depth, or in the height.

12. And Ahaz said, In no way shall I ask, nor shall I test the lord.

13. And he said, Hear indeed, O house of David! Is it a small thing to you [2a struggle 1to furnish] to men, then how [3to the lord 1do you furnish 2a struggle]?

14. On account of this, [3will give 1the lord 2himself] to you a sign; behold, the virgin [2in 3the womb 1will conceive], and shall bear a son, and you shall call  his name Immanuel.

15. Butter and honey he shall eat, before  he knows to prefer wicked or to choose the good.

16. For before  [3knows 1the 2male child] good or evil, in resisting persuasion of wickedness he chooses the good. And [3shall be abandoned 1the 2land] which you fear of in front of the two kings.

17. But [2shall bring 3upon 4you  1God], and upon  your people, and upon the house  of your father, days which [2not yet 1have 3come] from which day Ephraim removed from Judah the king of the Assyrians.

18. And it will be in  that day, the lord will whistle for the flies which shall dominate part of the river of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the place of the Assyrians.

19. And they shall come, and they shall all rest in the ravines of the place, and in the burrows of the rocks, and into the caves, and into every breach, and in every tree.

20. In  that day the lord shall shave with the razor  [5having been intoxicated 6from the other side 7of the 8river 3of the king 4of the Assyrians 1the 2head], even the hairs of the feet, and [2the 3beard 1he will remove].

21. And it will be in  that day, [2shall maintain 1a man] a heifer of the oxen, and two sheep.

22. And it will be from the much drinking of milk [7butter 8and 9honey 6shall eat 1every one  2being left behind 3upon 4the 5land].

23. And it will be in  that day that every place where ever might be a thousand grapevines worth a thousand shekels,  they shall be uncultivated and for the thorn-bush.

24. With arrow and bow they shall enter there; for it is an uncultivated land, and the thorn-bush will be in all the land.

25. And every mountain being plowed shall be plowed; in no way shall [2come upon 3there 1fear]; for it will be from the uncultivated land and thorn-bush a land for pastured sheep and for trampling of the ox.  

## Isaiah 8

1.  Assyria is The LORD's Instrument for Destruction And the lord said to me, Take to yourself [3roll of papyrus 2new 1a great], and write on it with the pen of a man concerning the swiftly [2plunder 1made] of spoils, for it is at hand!

2. And [2witnesses 3for me 1appoint] of trustworthy men --  Uriah the priest, and Zachariah son of Barachiah.

3. And I drew near to the prophetess; and [2in 3the womb 1she conceived], and gave birth to a son. And the lord said to me, Call  his name, Quickly Despoil, Swiftly Plunder.

4. Because before the [2knows  1child] to call his father or mother, one shall take t  he power of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.

5. And the lord proceeded to speak to me again, saying,

6. Because  [2want not  1this people] the water  of Shiloah  going tranquilly, but want to have  Rezin and the son of Remaliah king over them, therefore this --

7. behold, the lord leads against you the [4water 5of the 6river  1strong 2and 3abundant], the king of the Assyrians, and  his glory. And he shall ascend upon all your ravine, and shall walk upon all your wall.

8. And he shall remove from  Judea a man who shall be able [2his head 1to lift] or able to complete anything; and [2will be  1his camp] so as to fill the width  of your place; [2be with 3us  1God].

9. Know, O nations, and be vanquished! Take heed until the latter end of the earth! Being strong be vanquished! For if again you should be strong, again you shall be vanquished.

10. And whom ever you should consult counsel, the lord shall efface it; and [3word 1what 2ever] you should speak, in no way should it adhere to you; for [2is with 3us  1God]. 

11.  Severe Perplexity Thus says the lord, With the strong hand they resist persuasion in the going of the way  of this people, saying,

12. Lest at any time you should say, It is hard. For all what ever [2should say  1this people] is hard. But the fear of him in no way should you be fearful, nor should you be disturbed.

13. The lord of the forces -- sanctify him! and he will be your fear.

14. [3even 4upon 5him 2yielding 1You should be], he will be to you for a sanctuary; and not as a stone of stumbling for you to meet up with, nor as a rock downfall; but the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and in a hollow lying in wait in Jerusalem.

15. On account of this [2shall be powerless 3among 4them 1many], and shall fall, and shall be broken; and they shall approach, and [2shall be captured 1men] being in safety.

16. Then the ones [7apparent 6will be  1setting a seal upon themselves 4the 5law  2to not 3learn].

17. And one shall say, I shall wait  for God, the one turning  his face from the house of Jacob, and I will be yielding upon him.

18. Behold, I and the children which [2gave 3to me  1God], even they will be for signs and miracles in the house of Israel by the lord of Hosts who dwells on  mount Zion.

19. And if they should say to you, Seek the ones who deliver oracles, and the ones from the earth speaking out loud, and the empty words which [2from 3the 4belly 1they speak out loud]; shall not a nation [2to 3its God 1inquire]? Why do they inquire concerning the living of the ones dead?

20. [3the law 1For 4for 5a help 2he gave], that they should speak not as  this saying, concerning of which there are no gifts to give for it.

21. And shall come upon us harshly a famine; and it will be as whenever you should hunger, you shall be fretting, and [2wickedly 1you shall speak] of the ruler and the fathers; and they shall look up into the heaven upward,

22. and [2to 3the 4earth 5below 1they shall look], and behold, darkness, affliction and straits, and darkness so as to not see unto a time.  

## Isaiah 9

1.  Unto Us a Child Is Born [2this 3first 4quickly 1Drink]! Quickly act! O place of Zebulun, the land of Naphtali, and the rest on the coast, and on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!

2. The people  going in darkness beheld [2light 1a great]! The ones dwelling in a place and shadow of death, light shall radiate upon you.

3. The greatest part of the people you led down in gladness, and they shall be glad before you as the ones being glad in a harvest, and in which manner the ones dividing spoils.

4. Because [5was removed 1the 2yoke, the one 4upon them 3being situated], even the rod, the one upon  their neck; for the rod of the extractors he effaced as in the day  against Midian.

5. For every apparel [3assembled 4by treachery 1and 2garment], [2with 3reparation 1they shall pay]; and they shall want to even if it became scorched.

6. For a child was born to us; a son was given to us, of whom the sovereignty became upon  his shoulder; and [2is called  1his name], [2of great 3counsel 1Messenger], wonderful, counselor, [2God 1mighty], potentate, ruler of peace, father of the [2about to be 1eon]. For I will bring peace upon the rulers, and his health.

7. And great is his sovereignty, and  of his peace there is no end upon the throne of David, and  his kingdom to set it up and to take hold in judgment; even with righteousness from the present and into the eon. The zeal of the lord of Hosts shall do these things. 

8.  Judgment on Samaria [3death 2sent 1The lord] upon Jacob, and it came upon Israel.

9. And [5shall know 1all 2the 3people  4of Ephraim], and the ones settling in Samaria, with insolence and a haughty heart, saying,

10. The bricks are fallen, but come, we should dress stones. And we should fell sycamine trees and cedars, and we should build for ourselves a tower.

11. And [2shall dash down  1God] the ones rising against mount Zion, against him; and  [2his enemies 1he shall efface] --

12. Syria from [2of the sun 1the dawn], and the Greeks from [2of the sun 1the descent], the ones devouring  Israel with their whole  mouth. In all these things [3is not 4turned 1the 2rage], but still there is the [2hand 1high].

13. And the people did not turn until they were struck, and the lord of the forces they did not seek.

14. And the lord removed from Israel the head and tail, the great and small, in one day;

15. the old man, and the ones  [2persons 1admiring] -- this is the head; and the prophet teaching lawless things -- this is the tail.

16. And [6shall be 1the ones 2declaring 5blessed  4people 3this] misleading. And they misled so that they should swallow them down.

17. On account of this [5over  6their young men 3shall not 4be gladdened 1the 2 lord]; and upon  their orphans and  their widows he shall not show mercy. For all are lawless ones and wicked ones, and every mouth speaks unjustly. For all these things [2shall not 3turn away  1his rage], but still  his hand is high.

18. And [2shall burn 3as 4fire  1lawlessness]. And as [2wild grass 1dry] it shall be devoured by fire, and shall be burnt in the thickets of the grove, and shall devour together [2the things 3round about 4the 5hills 1all].

19. On account of the rage of the anger of the lord [3burns  2land 1the entire], and [3will be 1the 2people] as ones incinerated by fire. A man  [3his brother 1shall not 2show mercy on].

20. But one shall turn aside to the right hand, for he shall hunger; and he shall eat of the left, and in no way shall [2be filled up 1a man] eating the flesh  of his arm.

21. [3shall eat 1For 2Manasseh]  Ephraim, and Ephraim  Manasseh; for together they shall assault  Judah. For all these things [3shall not 4turn 1the 2rage], but still  his hand is high.  

## Isaiah 10

1.  Judgment against Oppressors Woe to the ones writing wickedness; for the ones writing [2wickedness 1are writing];

2. turning aside equity of the poor, snatching away a judgment of the needy  of my people, so that [2would be to them 1a widow] for ravaging, and an orphan for plunder.

3. And what will they do in the day of the visitation? For the affliction [2to you 3from a distance 1shall come], and to whom shall you take refuge  for help? And where will you leave  your glory,

4.  to not fall into enslavement? For [2underneath 3the ones being done away with 1they shall fall]. And for all these things [2shall not turn  1his anger], but still  his hand is high.

5. Woe to the Assyrians, the rod  of my rage, and anger is in  their hands.

6.  [2my anger 3against 5nation 4a lawless 1I will send], and  [2to my 3people 1I will give orders] to cause spoils and plunder, and to trample the cities, and to make them into dust.

7. But he did not [2thus 1ponder], and the soul did not [2thus 1consider]; but he shall dismiss  his mind even  to utterly destroy nations -- not a few.

8. And if they should say to him, You alone are ruler;

9. then he shall say, Did I not take the place  above Babylon and Chalanes, where the tower was built? and I took Arabia, and Damascus, and Samaria?

10. In which manner I took these, [2all 3the 4sovereignties 1I shall take]. Shriek,  O carvings in Jerusalem, and in Samaria!

11. [2in which 3manner 1For] I did to Samaria, and  its handmade things, so shall I do also  to Jerusalem and to her idols.

12. And it will be whenever the lord should complete all his doings on  mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will strike against the [2mind  1great], against the ruler of the Assyrians, and against the haughtiness of the glory  of his eyes.

13. For he said, [2in  3strength 1I will act]; and in the wisdom  of understanding I will remove boundaries of nations; and  [2their strength 1I will despoil];

14. and I will shake the cities being inhabited; and [3the 5world 4entire 1I will take  2by hand] as a nest; and [2as 4being left behind 3eggs 1I will lift them away]; and there is no one who shall evade me or contradict me, even opening a mouth and chirping.

15. Shall [2be glorified 1the axe] without the one beating with it, no. or shall [2be exalted 1the saw] without the one drawing with it, no. Likewise shall any lift a rod or wood and it shall not be so, no.

16. But [3sends 1the lord 2of Hosts] for  your honor -- dishonor; and for  your glory -- fire; by a burning it shall be burnt.

17. And [4shall be 1the 2light  3of Israel] for a fire; and he shall sanctify her in fire being burned; and it shall devour [3as 4grass 1the 2woods] in that day.

18. [3shall be consumed 1the 2mountains], and the hills, and the forests; and it shall devour from soul unto flesh. And it will be the one fleeing will be as the one fleeing from [2flame 1a burning].

19. And the ones being left behind of them will be a small number, and [2child 1a small] shall be able to write them. 

20.  The Returning Remnant And it will be in  that day, no longer [4proceed 1will the 2one being left behind 3of Israel], and the ones being preserved  of Jacob no longer should be yielding upon the ones wronging them. But they will be yielding upon  God, the holy one  of Israel, in the truth.

21. And [4will be 1the one 2being left behind  3of Jacob] relying upon the God having strength.

22. And if [4should become 1the 2people 3of Israel] as the sand of the sea, the vestige of them shall be preserved.

23. For the matter is being completed and being rendered concise in righteousness, for [3the matter 2is the one rendering 4concise 1the lord]. The lord of forces shall act in the [2world 1entire].

24. On account of this, Thus says the lord of Hosts, Do not fear, my people, O ones dwelling in Zion from the Assyrians! For with a rod he shall strike you, [3a calamity 1For 2he brings] upon you  beholding the way of Egypt.

25. For yet a little time and I will cease the anger,  but my rage is against  their plan.

26. And [5shall arise 6against 7them 1the lord  2God 3of the 4forces] according to the calamity of Midian in Place of Affliction. And  his rage is the way  by the sea into the way  according to Egypt.

27. And it will be in  that day I shall remove  his yoke from  your shoulder, and the fear of him from you; and [3shall be ruined 1the 2yoke] from  your shoulders.

28. For he shall come into the city of Angai, and shall go by to Maggedo, and in Michmash he shall place  his weapons.

29. And he shall go by the ravine, and shall come into Angai; fear shall take hold of Ramah; the city of Saul shall flee.

30. A snorting sound of your voice O daughter of Gallim; [2shall take heed 1Laish]; they shall take heed in Anathoth;

31. and Madmenah is startled, and the ones dwelling in Gebim.

32. Enjoin them today [2in 3the way  1to abide]! Enjoin  the mountain  daughter of Zion, and the hills in Jerusalem!

33. Behold, the master, the lord of Hosts puts in disorder the honorable ones with strength. And the haughty ones with insolence shall be broken, and the haughty ones shall be humbled.

34. And [2shall fall 1the haughty ones] by the sword;  and Lebanon [2with 3the 4haughty ones 1will fall].  

## Isaiah 11

1.  The Root of Jesse And [2shall come forth 1a rod] from out of the root of Jesse; and a flower from out of  his root shall ascend.

2. And [3will be caused to rest 4upon 5him 1spirit 2of the lord]; a spirit of wisdom and understanding; a spirit of counsel and strength; a spirit of knowledge and piety;

3. [4shall fill him up 1a spirit 2of the fear 3of God]. [2not 4according to 5the 6glory of man 1He shall 3judge], nor [2according to 3the 4speech 1shall he reprove].

4. But he shall judge [2of the lowly 1the case], and shall reprove for the lowly of the earth. And he shall strike the earth by the word  of his mouth; and by the breath through his lips he shall do away with the impious.

5. And righteousness will be tied around  his loin; and [2with truth 3being wrapped around  1his sides].

6. And [2shall be fed together 1the wolf] with the lamb; and the leopard shall be refreshed together with the kid; and a young calf and a lion and a bull [2together 1shall graze]; and [2child 1a small] shall lead them.

7. And the ox and bear shall graze together, and [3together 2will be  1their offspring]; and the lion [3as 4an ox 1shall eat 2straw].

8. And a child, an infant at burrows of asps, and at the bed of the progeny of asps,  [2his hand 1will put].

9. And in no way shall they do evil nor be able to destroy any one upon  [2mountain  1my holy]. For [3is filled up 1the 2whole area]  to know the lord, as [2water 1much] to cover up the sea. 

10.  The Gathering of Israel And it will be in  that day the root  of Jesse, and the one rising up to rule nations -- upon him nations shall hope. And [2will be  1his rest] honor.

11. And it will be in that day [3will proceed 1the 2 lord]  to show  his hand  to be jealous for the [4left behind 1vestige 2of the 3people], which ever should be left behind by the Assyrians, and by Egypt, and by Babylon, and by Ethiopia, and by the Elamites, and by [2of the sun 1the dawn], and from out of Arabia.

12. And he shall lift a sign unto the nations. And he will bring together the ones being destroyed of Israel. And [2the ones 3being dispersed 4of Judah 1he will gather] from out of the four wings of the earth.

13. And [4shall be removed 1the 2jealousy 3of Ephraim], and the enemies of Judah shall be destroyed. Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah will not afflict Ephraim.

14. And they shall fly in the boast of the Philistines west; together they shall despoil even the ones from [2of the sun 1the dawn], and Edom; and [3upon 4Moab 5first  2hands 1they shall put]; but the sons of Ammon at first shall obey.

15. And [2shall make 6desolate 1the lord 3the 4sea 5of Egypt]; and he shall put  his hand upon the river [2wind 1by a violent], and he shall strike seven ravines, so as to travel over it in sandals.

16. And there shall be a corridor to the one being left behind of my people, to the one being left behind from the Assyrians. And it will be  to Israel as in the day when they came forth from out of the land of Egypt.  

## Isaiah 12

1.  Songs of Praise And he shall say in  that day, I shall bless you, O lord, because you were provoked to anger against me, and you turned away  your rage, and showed mercy on me.

2. Behold,  my God, my deliverer; I will be yielding upon him, and I will not be fearful. Because  [2is my glory 3and  4my praise 1the lord]; and it became to me for deliverance.

3. Then draw water with gladness from out of the springs  of deliverance!

4. And you shall say in  that day, Sing praise to the lord! Yell out  his name! Announce among the nations  his honorable deeds! Mention that [2was exalted  1his name]!

5. Sing praise to the name of the lord! for [2high things 1he did]. Announce these things in all the earth!

6. Exult and be glad,  O ones dwelling in Zion! for [4is exalted 1the 2holy one  3of Israel] in the midst of her.  

## Isaiah 13

1.  The Vision against Babylon The vision against Babylon which [4beheld 1Isaiah 2son 3of Amoz].

2. [3upon 4a mountain 5plain 1Lift up 2a sign]! Raise up high the voice to them! Do not fear! Call for aid with the hand! Open, O rulers!

3. I order and I lead them; giants come to fill  my rage, rejoicing together and insulting.

4. A voice [2nations 1of many] upon the mountains, like [2nations 1many]; a voice of kings and nations being brought together. The lord of Hosts has given charge to a nation of armed warriors.

5. They come from out of a land at a distance, from the extremity of the foundation of the heaven; the lord and  his armed warriors, to ruin all the world.

6. Shriek! [4is near 1for 2the day 3of the lord], and destruction by God shall come.

7. Because of this every hand shall be loosened, and every soul of man shall be timid.

8. And [3shall be disturbed 1the 2ambassadors], and [2their pangs 1they shall have] as a woman giving birth; and they shall lament together, another to  another; and they shall be startled; and  [2countenance 3as 4a flame 1they shall change].

9. For behold the day of the lord comes; incurable rage and anger to make the world desolate, and [2the 3sinners 1to destroy] from out of it.

10. For the stars of the heaven, and  Orion, and all the cosmos of the heaven  [3of their light 1shall not 2give]; and [4shall be made dark 2of the 3sun 1the rising], and the moon shall not give  her light.

11. And I charge [2to the 4world 3entire 1evils], and to the impious  their sins; and I shall destroy the insolence of lawless ones; and [2the insolence 3of the proud 1I will abase].

12. And [3will be 1the 2ones being left 5rare 4more] than  [2gold  1unfired]; and a man [2more 3rare 1will be] than the stone, the one of Ophir.

13. For the heaven shall be enraged, and the earth shall be shaken from out of  its foundation, because of the rage of the anger of the lord of Hosts in the day which ever [2should come about  1his rage].

14. And [3will be 1the 2ones being left behind] as a young doe fleeing, and as a sheep wandering; and there is no one  gathering so as for a man [2to  3his people 1to return]; and a man [2unto  3his own place 1shall take flight].

15. For who ever should capture shall be vanquished; and the ones who [2being brought together 1are] shall fall by sword.

16. And  [2their children 1they shall dash] before them; and  [2their houses 1they shall despoil]; and  [2their women 1they shall have].

17. Behold, I rouse against you the Medes -- the [2silver 1ones not considering], nor [3of gold 2need 1have].

18. [2the bows 3of young men, 1They shall break], and  [3upon your children 1in no way 2shall they show mercy], nor   [3your children 2spare  1shall their eyes].

19. And Babylon will be (the place which is called honorable by the king of the Chaldeans) in which manner [2eradicated  1God] Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It shall not be dwelt in into the eon, nor shall they enter into it through many generations, nor shall [2go through 3it 1the Arabians], nor shepherds in any way shall rest in it.

21. And [2shall rest 3there 1wild beasts], and they shall fill up the houses with a sound; and [2shall rest 3there 1sirens], and demons will dance there.

22. And satyrs shall dwell there, and [2shall build a nest 1hedgehogs] in  their houses.  

## Isaiah 14

1.  The King of Babylon Quickly it comes, and shall not pass time, and their days in no way shall drag. And the lord shall show mercy on  Jacob, and will choose yet  Israel, and they shall rest upon  their land; and the foreigner shall be added to them, and they shall be added to the house of Jacob.

2. And [2shall take 3them 1nations], and bring them into  their place; and they shall inherit them, and they shall be multiplied upon the land  of God for manservants and maidservants; and [4shall be 5captives 1the 2ones capturing 3them]; and they shall dominate the ones dominating them.

3. And it will be in  that day [2will rest 3you 1the lord] from the grief, and  your rage, and  [3slavery 1your  2hard] of which you slaved for them.

4. And you shall take up  this wailing against the king of Babylon, and you shall say in  that day, O how [3has been rested 1the 2one exacting], and [3has been rested 1the 2taskmaster]!

5. The lord broke the yoke of the sinners, the yoke of the rulers.

6. Having struck a nation in rage [2calamity 1with an incurable]; hitting a nation with a calamity of rage, which he spared not, he rested persuading.

7. All the earth yells with gladness.

8. And the trees  of Lebanon shall be gladdened against you, and the cedar  of Lebanon, saying, From of which time you were laid low, there ascended not  one felling us.

9.  Hades from below was embittered meeting with you; [7were risen up together 8against you 1all 2the 3giants  4ruling 5the 6earth], the ones rising from  their thrones, all the kings of the nations.

10. All shall answer and shall say to you, You also captured as even we; [3among 4us 1and 2are you reckoned]?

11. [2went down 3into 4Hades  1Your glory],  [2great 3gladness 1your]; underneath you they shall make a bed of putrefaction, and  [2shall be your covering 1the worm]. 

12.  The Fallen Morning Star O how [3fell 4from out of 5the 6heaven 1the 2morning star] -- the one [2by morning 1rising]; [7was broken 8unto 9the 10earth 1the one 2sending 3to 4all 5the 6nations].

13. But you said in  your heart, Unto the heaven I shall ascend; [3upon 4the 5stars 6of the 7heaven 1I will put  2my throne]; I shall sit on [2mountain 1a high], upon the [2mountains  1high]  towards the north;

14. I will ascend upon the clouds; I will be likened to the highest.

15. But now [2into 3Hades 1you shall go down], and into the foundations of the earth.

16. The ones beholding you shall wonder over you, and shall say, Is this the man  provoking the earth, the one shaking kings;

17. the one making the inhabitable world desolate, and  [2its cities 1demolished]; the ones in enslavement he did not loose.

18. All the kings of the nations sleep in honor, every man in  his house.

19. But you shall be tossed in the mountains as dead, being abhorred with many having died being stabbed by a sword, going down into Hades.

20. In which manner a garment [2by 3blood 1being befouled] shall not be clean, so not even shall you be clean; because  [2my land 1you destroyed], and  [2my people 1killed]; in no way should you abide into the eon of time -- [2seed 1O evil].

21. Prepare  your children to be slain for the sins  of their father! that they should not rise up and inherit the earth, and should fill up the earth with wars.

22. And I will rise up against them, says the lord of Hosts, and I will destroy their name, and vestige, and seed -- thus says the lord.

23. And I will make the Babylonian region desolate so as for [2to dwell 1hedgehogs]. And it will be for nothing, and I will make it a clay pit for destruction. 

24.  The Plan for the Inhabitable World Thus says the lord of Hosts, In which manner I have said, so it will be; and in which manner I have deliberated, so it shall remain;

25.  even to destroy the Assyrians upon  [2land  1my], and upon  my mountains; and they will be for trampling. And [2shall be removed 3from 4them  1their yoke], and  their dignity [2from  3their shoulders 1shall be removed].

26. This  is the plan which the lord planned for all the inhabitable world. And this is the [2hand  1high] upon all the nations.

27. For what the [2God  1holy] planned, who shall efface? And  [5hand 3his  4high 1who 2shall turn]? 

28.  The Destruction of the Philistines The year in which [3died 2Ahaz  1king], came  this saying.

29. Be not glad  all Philistines, for he broke the yoke of the one hitting you. For from out of the seed of the serpent shall come forth a progeny of asps, and  their progeny shall come forth as [2serpents 1flying].

30. And [2shall be grazed 1the poor] by him; and poor men with peace shall rest; and he shall do away [2with 3hunger  1your seed]; and  your vestige he will do away with.

31. Shriek, O gates of the cities! Cry out, O cities! [4are being disturbed 2the 3Philistines 1All]. For from the north smoke comes, and there is no  being.

32. And what shall [3answer 1the kings 2of the nations]? For the lord laid a foundation in Zion, and through him [3shall be delivered 2peoples 1many].  

## Isaiah 15

1.  The Word against Moab The word against  Moab. [3by night 2shall be destroyed  1The land of Moab]; for by night [5shall be destroyed 1the 2wall 3of the 4land of Moab].

2. Fret for them! for [3shall be destroyed 1even 2Dibon], where  your shrine is. There you shall ascend to weep. Upon Nebo of the land of Moab shriek! Upon every head is baldness, all arms being mutilated.

3. In  their squares gird on sackcloths, and lament upon  her roofs! And in  her squares, and in  her streets all shriek with weeping!

4. For [4have cried out 1Heshbon 2and 3Elealeh]. Unto Jahaz [2was heard  1their sound]. On account of this the loin of the land of Moab yells.  Her soul shall know.

5. The heart of the land of Moab yells in her unto Zoar; [4heifer 1for 2it is as 3a three years old]. But upon the ascent of Luhith [2to 3you 4weeping 1they shall ascend]; by the way of Horonaim she yells, Defeat and quaking.

6. The water  of Nimrim shall be desolate, and  her grass shall fail; [5grass 1for 4green 2there will not 3be].

7. And shall she thus be about to be delivered? For I shall bring [2upon 3the 4ravine 1the Arabians], and they shall take it.

8. [4joined up with 1For 2the 3yelling] the border of the land of Moab  of Eglaim, and her shrieking; [2unto 3the 4well  5of Elim 1her shrieking].

9. For the water  of Dimon shall be filled with blood. For I shall bring upon Dimon the Arabians, and I will lift away the seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama.  

## Isaiah 16

1.  The Destruction of Moab I will send a male lamb lording over the land; [2not 9rock 8a desolate 1is 3the 4mountain 5of the 6daughter 7of Zion]?

2. For you shall be as [2winged creature 3flying about 1a young] being removed, O daughter of Moab; and thereupon, O Arnon.

3. Much counsel, [3make 1and also 4a protection 5for her mourning 2always]; [3at 4midday 2darkness 1they flee]; they are startled; do not celebrate.

4. [4shall sojourn 5with you 1The 2exiles 3of Moab]; they will be a protection for you from the face of the one pursuing; for [2was lifted away  1your alliance in war], and the [2ruler 3perished  1trampling] from the earth.

5. And [2shall be set right 3with 4mercy 1a throne]; and one shall sit upon it with truth in the tent of David, judging and inquiring of equity, and hastening righteousness.

6. We heard the insult of Moab -- insulting exceedingly; the pride and  his insult and  his vehement anger; not so your divination.

7. Moab shall shriek; for in the land of Moab all shall shriek. [2among 3the ones 4dwelling 1But] Seth you shall meditate upon, and you shall not be ashamed.

8. The plains of Heshbon shall mourn the grapevine of Sibmah. Swallowing down the nations, trampling  her grapevines, unto Jazer in no way shall you join together. Wander the wilderness! The ones being sent from her were abandoned, for they passed over the sea.

9. On account of this I shall weep as the one weeping of Jazer for the grapevine of Sibmah;  [5your trees 4cast down 1Heshbon 2and 3Elealeh]; for upon the harvest and upon the gathering of your crops I shall trample, and all shall fall.

10. And [4shall be lifted away 1gladness 2and 3the leap for joy] from the vineyards; and in  your vineyards in no way shall they be glad; and in no way shall they tread wine in the wine-vats; for the vintage has been ceased.

11. On account of this  my belly [4for 5Moab 2as 3a harp 1shall sound], and [2the things 3within me 4as 5a wall 1you renewed].

12. And it shall be for  your feeling of shame (for Moab tired upon the shrines) that he shall enter unto the handmade things of hers so as to pray; and in no way should they be able to rescue her.

13. This is the saying which the lord spoke against Moab.

14. And now the lord spoke, saying, In three years, of the years of a hireling, [4shall be dishonored 1the 2glory 3of Moab] in all the [2richness  1much]; and [2shall be left behind 1very few], and not the important.  

## Isaiah 17

1.  The Word against Damascus The word  against Damascus. Behold, Damascus shall be lifted from cities, and will be for a downfall;

2. being left behind into the eon for a bed, [3for flocks 1and 2a resting], and there will not be  one pursuing.

3. And no longer shall there be a fortified place  to take refuge there  for Ephraim; and no longer a kingdom in Damascus, nor  a remaining of the Syrians. [4no 1For 2you 5better 3are] than the sons of Israel, even  their glory; thus says the lord of Hosts.

4. It shall be in  that day an end of the glory of Jacob; and the plenty  of his glory shall be shaken.

5. And it shall be in which manner as if someone should gather [2harvest 1a standing], and [2the grain 3of corn 1should reap]; and it shall be in which manner if someone should gather corn in [2ravine 1a solid rock];

6. and as if [2should be left behind 3in 4it 1stubble], or as [5stones 4olive 1two 2or 3three] [2at 3the top of the tree 1elevated], or four or five [2upon  3their tender branches 1should be left behind]. Thus says the lord  God of Israel.

7.  In that day [2will be relying  1man] upon the one who made him,  and his eyes [2to 3the 4holy one  5of Israel 1shall look].

8. And in no way should they be relying upon the shrines, nor upon the works  of their hands which they made  with their fingers; and they shall not look to the trees, nor  their abominations.

9.  In that day [2shall be  1your cities] abandoned, in which manner [6left 1the 2Amorites 3and 4the 5Hivites] before the face of the sons of Israel; and they shall be desolate places.

10. Because you forsook the God  your deliverer, even your God you remembered not. On account of this you shall plant [2plant 1an untrustworthy], and [2seed 1an untrustworthy].

11. And in the day whenever you should plant, you shall be misled;  but [3by morning 1if 2you should sow] it shall bloom for a harvest in whatever day of inheritance; and as a father of a man, you shall choose by lot  for your sons.

12. Woe to the multitude [2nations 1of many]; as a sea swelling up, so you shall be disturbed; and the sound [2nations 1of many 4as 5water 3shall sound].

13. As [2water 1much 4nations 3many]; as [2water 1much 4by force 3being brought]; and he shall curse one to be far from them, and at a distance from them he shall pursue, as dust of mountains being winnowed before the wind, and as a cloud of dust [3of the wheel 2of a blast 1being brought].

14. Towards evening there will be mourning; before morning, and he will not be. This is the portion of the ones despoiling us, and the inheritance to the ones having inherited us.  

## Isaiah 18

1.  An Elevated Nation Woe, O land of boats of wings beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.

2. The one sending [5by 6the sea 1treaties 2and 4letters 3Bibline papyrus] upon the water; [4shall go 1for 2messengers 3of light] to [2nation 1an elevated], and a strange people, and ill-tempered. Who is it beyond, a nation unhoped for, and [4being trampled 5now 1the 2rivers  3of all the land]?

3. As a place being inhabited it shall be inhabited;  their place as a signal flag [2from 3a mountain 1should be lifted up]; as [2trumpet 3sound 1an audible].

4. Because thus said the lord to me; Safety will be in  my city, as the light of sweltering heat at midday, and [2as 3a cloud 4of dew 5in the day 6of harvest 1it will be].

5. Before the harvest, whenever [2should be completely formed 1the flower], and the unripe grape should blossom a flower being sour, that he shall remove the [2grape-clusters  1small] with the pruning sickles; and the small vine branches he shall remove and shall cut off.

6. And he shall leave them behind together for the winged creatures of the heaven, and for the wild beasts of the earth. And [5shall be brought together 6upon 7them 1the 2winged creatures 3of the 4heaven]; and all the wild beasts of the earth [2upon 3her 1shall come].

7. In  that time [2shall be offered 1gifts] to the lord of Hosts from a people being afflicted and being plucked, and from a people great from the present and into the eon of time; a nation hoping and being trampled, which is in a part of the river  of his place, to the place where the name of the lord of Hosts is -- in [2mountain 1the holy].  

## Isaiah 19

1.  The Vision of Egypt The vision of Egypt. Behold, the lord sits upon [2cloud 1a nimble], and shall come to Egypt. And [4shall be shaken 1the 2handmade idols 3of Egypt] before his face, and  their heart shall be vanquished in them.

2. And Egyptians shall be roused against Egyptians, and [2shall wage war against 1every man]  his brother, and every man against his neighbor; city against city, and abode against abode.

3. And [5shall be disturbed 1the 2spirit 3of the 4Egyptians] in themselves; and  [2their plan 1I shall efface]. And they shall ask  of their gods, and  of their statues, and the ones [2from out of 3the 4earth 1that speak out loud], and the ones delivering oracles.

4. And I will deliver up the Egyptian into the hands of men [2masters 1being hard]; and [2kings 1hard] shall lord over them. Thus says the lord of Hosts.

5. And [3shall drink 1the 2Egyptians] water  by the sea, for the river shall fail and shall dry up.

6. And [8shall fail 1the 2rivers 3and 4the 5aqueducts 6of the 7river]; and [4shall be dried up 1all 2the gathering 3of water], and in every marsh of reed and papyrus,

7. and  [2the green 1all]  round about the river, and all the thing being sown throughout the river shall be dried, destroyed by the wind.

8. And [3shall moan 1the 2fishermen]; and [8shall moan 1all 2the ones 3throwing 4a hook 5into 6the 7river]; and the ones throwing dragnets and the casting-net fishermen shall mourn.

9. And shame shall take the ones working the [2flax  1shredded], and the ones working the linen.

10. And [4will be 1the 2ones working 3them] in grief; and all the ones making  beer shall be fretful; and the souls shall cause pain.

11. And [4will be morons 1the 2rulers 3of Tanis]; and the wise counselors of the king,  their counsel will be moronish. How shall you say to the king, [2sons 3of discerning men 1We are], sons of kings  from the beginning?

12. Where are they now,  your wise men? and let them announce to you, and say what [3planned 1the lord 2of Hosts] against Egypt.

13. [4failed 1The 2rulers 3of Tanis], and [4are haughty 1the 2rulers 3of Memphis]; and they shall cause Egypt to wander and the tribes.

14. For the lord mixed for them a spirit addicted to a delusion; and they caused Egypt to wander in all  its works, as [3wanders 1the one 2being intoxicated] and the one vomitting together.

15. And there will not be [2for the 3Egyptians 1work], which shall make head or tail, and beginning or end.

16. In that day [3will be 1the 2Egyptians] as women, in fear and in trembling from in front of the hand of the lord of Hosts, which he shall put upon them.

17. And [5will be 1the 2place 3of the 4Jews] to the Egyptians for a fearful thing; any one who might name it to them, they shall fear, because of the plan which the lord of Hosts planned against it. 

18.  Egypt, Assyria, and Israel Blessed In that day there will be five cities in  Egypt speaking the tongue of the Canaanites, and swearing by an oath to the name of the lord of Hosts. [5City 6of Asedek 4shall be called 1The 2one 3city].

19. In that day there will be an altar to the lord in the region of the Egyptians; and there will be a monument at  its border to the lord.

20. And it will be for a sign into the eon to the lord in the place of Egypt; for they shall cry out to the lord because of the ones afflicting them; and he shall send to them a man who will deliver them; by judging he shall deliver them.

21. And [3made known 2will be 1the lord] to the Egyptians; and [3shall know 1the 2Egyptians] the lord in  that day; and they shall make a sacrifice offering and a gift offering; and they shall vow vows to the lord, and shall render them.

22. And the lord shall strike the Egyptians with a calamity, and he shall heal them; and they shall be turned towards the lord; and he shall listen to them, and he shall heal them with healing.

23. In that day there will be a way of Egypt to the Assyrians; and [2shall enter 1the Assyrians] into Egypt, and Egypt will go to the Assyrians, and [3shall serve 1the 2Egyptians] to the Assyrians.

24. In that day Israel will be third with the Egyptians and with the Assyrians, being blessed in the land;

25. which [3blessed 1the lord 2of Hosts], saying, Blessed be  my people, the one in Egypt, and the one among the Assyrians, and  my inheritance Israel.  

## Isaiah 20

1.  Isaiah Goes Barefoot and Naked The year that Tartan entered unto Ashdod, when he was sent by Sargon king of the Assyrians, and he waged war against Ashdod, and overtook it,

2. Then the lord spoke to Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, Go and remove the sackcloth from  your loin, and  [2your sandals 1untie] from  your feet! And he did thus, going naked and barefoot.

3. And the lord said, In which manner [3goes 1Isaiah  2my servant] naked and barefoot -- three years shall be signs and miracles to the Egyptians and Ethiopians;

4. for thus [3shall lead 1the king 2of the Assyrians] the captivity of Egypt and Ethiopia, young men and old men, naked and barefoot, uncovering the shame of Egypt.

5. And they shall be ashamed being vanquished upon the Ethiopians of whom [3were 4relying 1the 2Egyptians], for they were their glory.

6. And [6shall say 1the 2ones dwelling 3in 4the 5island] this in  that day, Behold, we were relying  to flee to them for help, to the ones who were not able to be delivered from the king of the Assyrians; and how shall we be delivered?  

## Isaiah 21

1.  The Vision of the Wilderness The vision of the wilderness. As a blast [2through 3a wilderness 1might go], from out of the wilderness coming from land;

2. so a fearful  [3vision 1and 2hard] was announced to me; the one disregarding disregards; the one acting lawlessly acts lawlessly. [3are upon 4me 1The 2Elamites], and the ambassadors of the Persians [2against 3me 1come]. Now I shall moan and shall comfort myself.

3. Because of this [2was filled  1my loin] with feebleness, and pangs took me as the one giving birth. I transgressed  to not hear, I hurried  to not see.

4.  My heart wanders, and  lawlessness immerses me;  my soul attends to fear.

5. Prepare the table! Eat! Drink! Rising up are the rulers. Pull up shields!

6. For thus said the lord to me, Proceeding, [2yourself 1stand] as watchman, and whatever you should behold announce!

7. And I saw riders -- [2horsemen 1two], a rider of a donkey, and a rider of a camel. Listen [2hearing 1with great]!

8. And call Uriah to the watchtower of the lord! And he said, I stood always by day, and over the camp I stood all the night. 

9.  Babylon is Fallen And behold, he comes -- a rider of a double chariot; and responding he said, Has fallen, has fallen, Babylon and all  her statues; and  her handmade idols were broken unto the ground.

10. Hear! O ones being left behind, and, O ones grieving. Hear what I heard from the lord of Hosts! what the God  of Israel announced to you. 

11.  The Vision of Edom The vision  of Edom. [2to 3me 1He called] from  Seir. Guard the parapets!

12. I guard in the morning, and the night; if you should seek, seek; and [2with 3me 1live]!

13. In the forest by evening you shall bed down in the way of Dedan;

14. for meeting with the one thirsting [2water 1bring]! O ones dwelling in the place of Tema. [2with bread loaves 1Meet] the ones fleeing!

15. because of the multitude of the ones being slain, and because of the multitude of the ones wandering, and because of the multitude of the swords, and because of the multitude of the bows of the ones being extended, and because of the multitude of the ones fallen in the battle.

16. For thus [2said 3to me 1the lord], Yet a year, as the year of a hireling, [4shall fail 1the 2glory 3of Kedar].

17. And the remnant of the [2bowmen  1strong] of the sons of Kedar will be few. For the lord  God of Israel spoke.  

## Isaiah 22

1.  The Ravine of Zion The matter of the ravine of Zion. What happened to you that now you [2ascended 1all] unto the roofs in vain?

2. [3was filled up 1the 2city] of ones yelling.  Your slain are not slain ones by swords, nor  your dead dead ones by war.

3. All  your rulers have fled together from the bow, [2being tied 1they are], and the ones being strong among you [2at a distance 1have fled].

4. On account of this, I said, Let me go! [2bitterly 1I shall weep]. You should not grow strong to comfort me over the destruction of the daughter  of my people.

5. For it is a day of disturbance, and destruction, and trampling, and an addiction to a delusion by the lord of Hosts. [2in 3the ravine 4of Zion 1They wander]. [2from 3small 4unto 5great 1They wander] upon the mountain.

6. But the Elamites took quivers, and [2riders 1men] upon horses, and there was a gathering of a battle array.

7. And [4will be  2choice 3ravines 1your] filled of chariots, and the horsemen shall obstruct  your gates.

8. And they shall uncover the gates of Judah, and they shall look  in that day unto the choice houses of the city.

9. And they shall uncover the hidden places of the houses of the Akra of David. And they saw that [2many more 1there were], and they turned the water of the ancient pool into the city;

10. and that they demolished the houses of Jerusalem for fortification of the walls of the city.

11. And you produced for yourselves water between the two walls inside the [2pool  1ancient], but you did not look to the [3in 4the beginning 1one making 2it]; and the one creating it you did not behold.

12. And [3called 1the lord 2of Hosts 5in  6that day 4for weeping], and beating the breast, and shaving, and girding up sackcloths.

13. But they were making glad and leaping for joy, slaying calves, and sacrificing sheep so as to eat meat and to drink wine, saying, We should eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.

14. And [2being uncovered 1these things are] in the ears of the lord of Hosts, for [3shall not 4be forgiven 5you 1this  2sin] until whenever you should die.

15. Thus says the lord of Hosts, Go into the cubicle, to Somnan the storekeeper, and say to him,

16. Why are you here? and what is there to you here? that you quarried for yourself here a memorial, and made for yourself in a high place a memorial, and depicted to yourself [2in 3the rock 1a dwelling].

17. Behold, indeed, the lord of Hosts shall cast out and shall obliterate such a man, and shall remove  your apparel, and  [3crown 1your  2honorable],

18. and will toss you into [4place 1a great 2and 3unmeasured], and there you shall die; and he will establish  [3chariot 1your  2good] for dishonor, and the house  of your ruler for trampling.

19. And you shall be removed from  your administration, and from  your station.

20. And it will be in  that day, even I will call  my servant Eliakim the son of Helkiah;

21. and I will put on him  your apparel, and  [3your crown 1I will give 2to him]. And  might, and  your administration I will put into  his hands; and he shall be as a father to the ones dwelling Jerusalem, and to the ones dwelling Judah.

22. And I will put to him the key of the house of David upon  his shoulder. And he shall open, and there will not be  one locking. And he shall lock, and there shall not be  one opening. And I will give the glory of David to him. And he will rule, and there will not be  one disputing.

23. And I will establish him as ruler in [2place 1a trustworthy], and he will be for a throne of glory  [2house  1for his father's].

24. And [7will be 8relying 9upon 10him 1every 2honorable one 3in 4the 5house  6of his father], from small unto great; every  [2vessel  1small] from vessels of the cups. And they will be hanging upon him in  that day.

25. Thus says the lord of Hosts, [7shall be moved 1The 2man  3being fixed fast 4in 6place 5a trustworthy]; and [4shall be removed 5and 6shall fall 7and 8shall waste away 1the 2glory  3upon him]; for the lord spoke.  

## Isaiah 23

1.  The Word Concerning Tyre The matter of Tyre. Shriek O boats of Carthage! For she perished, and no longer do they come from out of the land of Chittim; she is led captive.

2. To whom [8likened 1have 7become 2the ones 3dwelling 4in 5the 6island]; traders of Phoenicia passing through the sea;

3. in [2water 1much]; a seed of traders; [5as 6a harvest 7being carried in 1the 2traders 3of the 4nations].

4. Be ashamed, O Sidon, said the sea! Even the strength of the sea said, I travailed not, nor gave birth, nor nourished young ones, nor raised up virgins.

5. But whenever [2audible 1it should become] in Egypt, [2shall overtake them 1grief] concerning Tyre.

6. Go forth to Carthage! Shriek! O ones dwelling in  this island.

7. [3not 2this 1Was]  your insolence, the one from the beginning, before  she was delivered up?

8. Who planned these things against Tyre?  [2she inferior 1Is] or not strong?  Her merchants were the glorious rulers of the earth.

9. The lord of Hosts plans to disable all the insolence of the glorious ones, and to dishonor every glorious thing upon the earth.

10. Work  your land! for even boats no longer come from out of Carthage.

11.  And your hand no longer prevails against the sea, O one provoking kings. The lord of Hosts gave charge concerning Canaan, to destroy her  strength.

12. And they shall say, No longer in any way should you proceed  to insult and to wrong the daughter of Zion; and if you should go forth to Chittim, not even there shall be rest to you.

13. And if you depart unto the land of the Chaldeans, even this was made desolate from the Assyrians, not even there [2to you 1will be rest], for  her wall has fallen.

14. Shriek! boats of Carthage, for [2is destroyed  1your fortress].

15. And it will be in  that day, Tyre shall be forsaken [2years 1for seventy], as the time [2king 1of one], as the time of a man. And after seventy years Tyre will be as the song of a harlot.

16. Take a harp! Stray! [2city 1O harlot] being forgotten. [2well 1Play the harp]! [2much 1Sing]! that the memory of you takes place.

17. And it will be after the seventy years, [3a visit 2will make  1God] to Tyre, and again she shall be restored to  her ancient state; and she shall be a market-place for all the kingdoms of the inhabitable world upon the face of the earth.

18. And [5will be 1her  2trade 3and  4wage] holy  to the lord. [2not 4to them 1It shall 3be brought], but to the ones dwelling before the lord, even all  her trade, to eat and to drink, and be filled, and for a compact memorial before the lord.  

## Isaiah 24

1.  The Desolation of the Inhabitable World Behold, the lord lays waste the [2inhabitable world 1whole], and will make it desolate, and shall uncover  its surface, and disperse the ones dwelling on it.

2. And [3will be 1the 2people] as priests; and the servant as the master; and the female attendant [2as 3the 4lady 1will be]; the one buying as the one selling; the one borrowing as the one lending; and the one owing as the one who is owed.

3. By corruption [3shall be corrupted 1the 2earth]; and by plunder [3shall be plundered 1the 2earth]; for the mouth of the lord spoke these things.

4. [3mourns 1The 2earth], and [3is corrupted 1the 2world]; [5mourn 1the 2lofty ones 3of the 4earth].

5. And the earth acted lawlessly on account of the ones inhabiting her; because they transgressed the law of the lord, and effaced and bartered away the orders -- [2covenant 1the eternal].

6. Therefore this curse shall devour the earth; for [4sinned 1the ones 2dwelling 3on it]; on account of this [6will be poor 1the ones 2dwelling 3on 4the 5earth], and [3will be left behind 2men 1a few].

7. [2shall mourn 1The wine], [2shall mourn 1the grapevine], [5shall moan 1all 2the ones 3being glad  4in soul].

8. [3has ceased 1The gladness 2of tambourines]; [5have ceased 1self-sufficiency 2and 4riches 3impious]; [3has ceased 1the sound 2of the harp].

9. They are ashamed, they did not drink wine; [3bitter 2became  1liquor] to the ones drinking.

10. [3was desolate 1Every 2city]. One shall lock the house  to not enter.

11. Shriek for the wine everywhere! [5has ceased 1All 2gladness 3of the 4earth]; [5departed 1all 2gladness 3of the 4earth];

12. and [3shall be left behind 2cities 1desolate], and houses being abandoned shall be consumed.

13. All these things will be on the earth in the midst of the nations. In which manner as if one should glean an olive tree, thus shall they glean them, even as if [3should cease 1the 2gathering a crop],

14. And these in a voice shall yell out; but the ones being left behind upon the earth shall be glad together in the glory of the lord; [5shall be disturbed 1the 2water 3of the 4sea].

15. On account of this the glory of the lord [2among 3the 4islands 1will be] of the sea; the name of the lord will be honored.

16. O lord  God of Israel, from the wings of the earth [2miracles 1we heard] -- hope to the pious; but they shall say, Woe to the ones annulling -- the ones annulling the law.

17. Fear, and a pit, and a snare is upon you, O ones dwelling upon the earth.

18. And it will be the one fleeing the fear shall fall into the pit; and the one going up from out of the pit shall be captured by the snare; for windows from out of the heaven were opened, and [5shall be shaken 1the 2foundations 3of the 4earth].

19. By disturbance [3shall be disturbed 1the 2earth]; and with perplexity [3shall be perplexed 1the 2earth].

20. It leans and [3shall be shaken 4as 5a storehouse of fruits 1the 2earth]; as the one being intoxicated and dizzy; and it shall fall, and in no way be able to rise up. [3shall grow strong 1For 4upon 5it  2lawlessness].

21. And it will be in  that day [2shall bring  1God 5against 6the 7cosmos 8of the 9heaven 3the 4hand], and against the kings of the earth.

22. And they shall gather its congregation, and shall lock them into a fortress and in a jail; through many generations [3visited 2will be 1they].

23. And [3shall melt away 1the 2brick], and [3shall fall 1the 2wall], and [3shall feel remorse 1the 2moon], and [3shall be ashamed 1the 2sun], for the lord shall reign in Zion, and from out of Jerusalem, and [2before 3the 4elders 1he shall be glorified].  

## Isaiah 25

1.  Praise to The LORD O lord  my God, I will glorify you, I shall sing praise  to your name; for you did wonderful things; [3counsel 2ancient 1true]. May it be.

2. For you made cities into a heap of embankments, cities fortified  to not fall of their  foundations. [2of the 3impious 1The city 6for the 7eon 4in no way 5should be built].

3. On account of this, [4shall bless 5you 1the 3people 2poor], and cities of men being wronged shall bless you.

4. For you became [2to every 4city 3humble 1a helper], and [2to the ones 3depressed 4on account of 5lack 1a protection]; [3from 5men 4wicked 1you shall rescue 2them]; a protection to the ones thirsting, and a fresh wind for men being wronged;

5. as [2men 1faint-hearted] thirsting in Zion, for you shall rescue them from [2men 1impious], to whom [2us 1you delivered].

6. And [3shall make a feast 1the lord 2of Hosts] for all the nations; upon  this mountain they shall drink in gladness, they shall drink wine.

7. They shall anoint with a perfumed liquid on  this mountain. You deliver all these things to the nations,  for this plan is for all the nations.

8. [2swallowed  1Death] prevailing; and again [3removed 1the lord  2God] every tear from every face; [2the 3scorn 4of the 5people 1he removed] from all the earth; for the mouth of the lord spoke.

9. And they shall say  in that day, Behold,  our God upon whom we hoped, even he shall deliver us. This is the lord. We waited for him, and we exulted and were glad over  our deliverance.

10. [3rest 2will give  1God] upon  this mountain, and [3shall be trampled 1the 2land of Moab], in which manner they tread the threshing-floor with wagons.

11. And he shall unfasten  his hands, in which manner even as he humbled  to destroy. And he shall humble  his insolence upon which  [2his hands 1he put].

12. And the height of the refuge  of your house he will lower; and it shall go down unto the ground.  

## Isaiah 26

1.  A Song of Deliverance  In that day they shall sing  this song upon the land  of Judea, Behold, [2city 1a strong]; and [2our deliverance 1he shall establish] for the wall and rampart.

2. Open O gates! Enter! O people guarding righteousness, and guarding truth;

3. taking hold of truth, and guarding peace.

4. For upon you we hoped, O lord unto the eon, the [3God  1great  2eternal];

5. who humbling, he led down the ones dwelling on high. [3cities 2fortified 1You shall throw down], and lead them down unto the ground.

6. And [3will tread 4them 2feet 1gentle] and of humble rostrums.

7. The way of the pious [2straight 1becomes]; and [5is being prepared 1the 2way 3of the 4pious].

8. For the way of the lord is equitable; we hoped upon  your name, and upon the remembrance of you

9. which [2desires  1our soul]. From out of the night [2rises early  1my spirit] to you, O God, because [2are light  1your orders] upon the earth. [2righteousness 1Learn], O ones dwelling upon the earth!

10. [4ceases 1For 2the 3impious]; in no way should he learn righteousness upon the earth; [3truth 1no way 2should he execute]. Lift away the impious! that he should not behold the glory of the lord.

11. O lord, [3is high 1your  2arm], but they did not know; but in knowing they shall be ashamed; zeal shall take hold [2people 1of an uninstructed]; and now fire [2the 3adversaries 1shall devour].

12. O lord  our God, [2peace 1give] to us! for all things you rendered to us.

13. O lord  our God, acquire us! O lord, outside of you there is no other we know.  [2your name 1We named].

14. But the dead [3life 1in no way 2shall see], nor shall physicians in any way raise them up. On account of this you struck, and destroyed; and you lifted away every male of them.

15. Add to them bad things, O lord, add bad things to the glorious ones of the earth!

16. O lord, in affliction we remembered you; in [2affliction 1small]  your instruction is with us.

17. And as a woman travailing approaches  to give birth, and over  her birth pangs she cries out, so we were to your beloved.

18. Because of the fear of you, O lord, [2in 3the womb 1we conceived], and travailed, and birthed the breath of your deliverance, which you did upon the earth. We shall not fall, but [7shall fall 1all 2the ones 3dwelling 4upon 5the 6earth].

19. [3shall rise up 1The 2dead], and [5shall be raised 1the ones 2in 3the 4sepulchres], and [5shall be glad 1the ones 2in 3the 4earth], for the dew  by you [2a cure 3to them 1is]; but the land of the impious shall fall.

20. Proceed, O my people! Enter into  your inner chambers! Lock  your door! Be concealed a little! as much as this, as much as that, until whenever [4should go by 1the 2anger 3of the lord].

21. For behold the lord [3from 4the 5holy place 1brings  2anger] upon the ones dwelling upon the earth; and [3shall uncover 1the 2earth]  her blood, and shall not cover up the ones being done away with any more.  

## Isaiah 27

1.  The Dragon Serpent In  that day [2will bring on  1God] the [8sword  1holy 2and 3the 4great 5and 6the 7strong] against the dragon, [2serpent 1the fleeing] -- against the dragon, [2serpent 1the crooked]. And he will do away with the dragon, the one in the sea.

2.  In that day [2vineyard 1there shall be a good], and a desire to lead a song concerning it.

3. I am [2city 1a fortified], a city being assaulted. In folly I water her, for she shall be captured by night, and by day [2shall fall  1her wall].

4. There is not her who did not take hold of her; therefore because of this the lord did all as much as he ordered. I am incinerated.

5. [6shall yell 1All 2the ones 3dwelling 4in 5her], We should make peace with him, we should make peace.

6. The ones coming are children of Jacob. [2shall burst forth 3and 4shall blossom 1Israel], and [3shall be filled with 1the 2inhabitable world]  its fruit.

7. Is it not as he struck others, even he himself so shall be struck? And as he did away with, also he himself thus shall be done away with?

8. [2doing combat 3and 4berating 1He shall send them out]. [3not 2you 1Were] the one meditating with  [2spirit  1a harsh], to do away with them in a spirit of rage?

9. On account of this [3shall be removed 1the 2lawlessness] from Jacob; and this is  his blessing; whenever I should remove [3from him 1the 2sin]; whenever they should furnish all the stones of the shrines for being cut in pieces as [2powder 1fine]; and in no way should [2remain  1their trees], and  their idols shall be in the state of being cut down as a forest far off.

10. The [2dwelling there 1flock 4spared 3will be] as a flock being left behind; and there will be much time for pasture, and there they shall rest.

11. And after much time there will not be in it any green thing on account of  drying out. O women coming from a spectacle, come. [5no 1for 3a people 2it is 4having] understanding. On account of this in no way should [4pity 1the one 2making 3them], nor the one shaping them in any way show mercy.

12. And it will be in  that day the lord will shut up together from the aqueduct of the river unto Rhinocora. But you gather together the sons of Israel, according to one by one!

13. And it will be in  that day they shall trump the [2trumpet  1great], and [8shall come 1the ones 2being lost 3in 4the 5place 6of the 7Assyrians], and the ones being lost in Egypt. And they shall do obeisance to the lord upon the [2mountain  1holy] in Jerusalem.  

## Isaiah 28

1.  Woe to the Hirelings of Ephraim Woe to the crown  of insolence, the hirelings of Ephraim, the flower, the one having fallen of the glory upon the top of the [2mountain  1thick branched], the ones being intoxicated without wine.

2. Behold, strong and hard is the rage of the lord; as hail being carried down not having protection, with force being carried down; as [3water 2of much 1a multitude] dragging a place along. In the land he shall cause rest to the hands.

3. And by the feet [4shall be trampled 1the 2crown  3of insolence], the hirelings  of Ephraim.

4. And [3shall be 1the 2flower] (the one having fallen off of the hope of the glory) upon the tip of the [2mountain  1high] as a forerunner of a fig. The one beholding it, before [2into  3his hand 1taking it], will want to swallow it down.

5.  In that day [3will be 1the lord 2of Hosts] the crown  of hope, the plaited crown  of glory to the one being left behind of my people.

6. And they shall be left behind in spirit of equity for judgment, and for the strength restraining doing away with. 

7.  The Offending Priests and Prophets For these [3in wine 2wandering 1are]; wandering because of the liquor; the priest and prophet are startled because of the liquor; they are swallowed down because of the wine; they are shaken from the intoxication of the liquor; they wandered; this is a visible manifestation.

8. A curse shall devour this  plan, for this  plan is because of the desire for wealth.

9. To whom did we announce evils? and to whom did we announce a message? even to the ones being weaned from milk, and the ones being drawn away from the breast.

10. Affliction upon affliction; favorably receive hope upon hope; still a little, still a little,

11. because of disparagement of the lips; [3by 5tongue 4another 1for 2they shall speak]  to this people,

12. saying to it, This is the rest to the one hungering, and this is the destruction; and they did not want to hear.

13. And [4will be 5to them 1the 2oracle  3of God], affliction upon affliction, hope upon hope, still a little, still a little; that they should go and should fall to the rear, and shall be exposed to danger, and shall be broken, and shall be captured.

14. On account of this hear the word of the lord, O men being afflicted, and  rulers  of this people  in Jerusalem!

15. For you said, We made a covenant with  Hades, and [2with  3death 1treaties]. [2a gale 3being brought 1If] should go by, in no way should it come to us. We made the lie  our hope, and by the lie we shall be sheltered. 

16.  The Cornerstone in Zion On account of this, thus says the lord, Behold, I shall put for the foundations of Zion [4stone 1a very costly 2chosen 3cornering] of value for  its foundations; and the one trusting upon it in no way should be disgraced.

17. And I shall place judgment for hope,  and my charity by weights. And the ones relying vainly in a lie that in no way should [2go by 3you 1the gale];

18. even [4should not have removed 1your  2covenant  3of death]; and  your hope, the one in  Hades in no way should adhere. [2the blast 3being brought 1If] should come, you will be [3by it 1for 2trampling].

19. Whenever it should go by, it shall take you. Morning by morning it shall go by you, and in the night it will be [2hope 1an evil]. Learn to hear!

20. O ones having been restricted, in no way are we able to do combat; but we are ourselves weakened  for you to gather.

21. As if a mountain of impious men the lord shall rise up; and it shall be in the ravine of Gibeon; with rage he shall execute  his works -- [2of bitterness 1a work];  but his rage [2strangely 1he shall treat], and  his rottenness in strangeness.

22. And you, may you not be glad, nor [3strengthen 4in you 1the 2bonds]; because [3being completed 4and 5being rendered concise 2the things 1I heard] by the lord of Host, which he will do upon all the earth.

23. Give ear and hearken  to my voice! Take heed and hear  my words!

24. Shall not [5the entire  6day 3be about 1the 2one plowing 4to plow]? or the one sowing, will he not prepare beforehand to work the ground?

25. Does he not whenever he should level the face of it, then sow the small pepperwort or cummin, and again sow wheat, and barley, and spelt, in  your boundaries?

26. And you shall be corrected in the equity of your God, and shall be glad.

27. For not with hardness [2cleansed  1is the pepperwort], nor [2the wheel 3of a wagon 1shall] lead about upon the cummin; but [4by a rod 3is shaken off 1the 2pepperwort].

28. But the cummin [2with 3bread 1shall be eaten], [3not 1for 6into 7the 8eon 2I am 4provoked to anger 5against you], nor shall the voice  of my bitterness trample you.

29. And these [3by 4the lord 5of Hosts 2came forth  1miracles]. Take counsel, exalt vain comfort!  

## Isaiah 29

1.  Woe O City of Ariel Woe city of Ariel, which David waged war. Gather together produce year by year! for you shall eat with Moab.

2. For I will squeeze Ariel, and [5will be 1her  2strength 3and  4riches] mine.

3. And I will encircle as David upon you, and I will throw up [2around 3you 1a siege mound], and I will build, and I will set [2around 3you 1towers].

4. And [2shall be abased  1your words] unto the ground. And unto the ground  your words shall go down. And [2will be 3as 4the ones 5speaking out loud 6from out of 7the 8earth  1your voice]; and to the ground  your voice shall weaken.

5. And [5will be 6as 7a cloud of dust 8from 9a wheel 1the 2riches 3of the 4impious]; and [6will be as 7dust 8being borne about 1the 2multitude 3of the ones 4afflicting 5you]; and it will be [2as 3a moment 1immediate],

6. by the lord of Hosts; [3a visitation 1for 2there will be] with thunder, and earthquake, and [2sound 1a great], a blast being borne about, and a flame of fire devouring.

7. And [6will be 7as 8ones dreaming 9in 10sleep 1the 2riches 3of all 4the 5nations], as many as march against Ariel, and all the ones soldiering against Jerusalem, and all the ones gathering together against her, and the ones afflicting her.

8. And it shall be as the ones in sleep drinking and eating and rising up. [4is vain 3of them 1the 2dream], and in which manner [5shall dream 1the one 2thirsting 3and 4drinking], and rising up they still thirst,  and his soul [2in 3vain 1hoped], so will be the riches of all the nations, as many as marched against  mount Zion. 

9.  Spirit of Vexation Be loosened! Be amazed and be dizzy! Not from liquor nor from wine.

10. For [2has given you to drink 1the lord] a spirit of vexation. And he will close the eyelids  of their eyes, and  their prophets, and  their rulers, the ones seeing the hidden things.

11. And [4shall be 5to you 1all  3sayings 2these] as the words  [2scroll  3having a seal set upon it 1of this]; which if they should give it to a man having knowledge of letters, saying, Read these things! Then he shall say, I am not able to read, for it is sealed.

12. And [3will be given  2scroll 1this] into the hands of a man not having knowledge of letters. And one shall say to him, Read this! And he shall say, I do not have knowledge of letters.

13. And the lord said, [2approach 3unto me  1this people] with  their mouth, and by  their lips they esteem me,  but their heart is far off at a distance from me; and in vain they worship me, teaching the precepts [3of men 1and 2instructions].

14. On account of this, behold, I shall proceed  to transpose  this people; and I will transpose them, and I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and [2the 3understanding 4of the 5discerning 1I will hide].

15. Woe to the ones deeply [2plans 1making], and not according to the lord. Woe to the ones [3in 4secret 2plans 1making]. And [2shall be 3in 4darkness  1their works], and they shall say, Who has seen us, and who shall know us or what we do?

16. [2not 4as 5clay 6for the 7potter 1Shall you 3be considered]? Shall [3say 1the 2thing shaped] to the one shaping, You did not shape me. Or the thing made by the one making it, [2not 3expertly 1You did] make me? 

17.  The Deaf-mutes Shall Hear No longer a little while and [2shall be transposed  1Lebanon] as the mountain  of fruitful field; and the mountain of fruitful field [2as 3a forest 1shall be considered].

18. And [4shall hear 1in  2that day 3deaf-mutes] the words of the scroll; and the ones in  darkness, and the ones in  fog -- the eyes of the blind will see,

19. and [2shall exult 1the poor] because of the lord with gladness, and the ones despairing  of men shall be filled up with gladness.

20. [2failed 1The lawless one], and [2is destroyed 1the proud one], and [5shall be utterly destroyed 1the ones 2acting lawlessly 3concerning 4evil],

21. even the ones causing [2to sin 1men] by a word. [3all 1And 4the ones 5reproving 6at 7the gates 8to be considered for stumbling 2men shall make], for they bent away [2by 3unjust acts 1the just one].

22. On account of this, thus says the lord concerning the house of Jacob, whom he separated from Abraham, [3not 4now 2shall 5be ashamed 1Jacob], nor now  [2countenance 1shall Israel change].

23. But whenever [2shall behold  1their children]  my works, because of me they shall sanctify  my name, and they shall sanctify the holy one of Jacob, and [2the 3God  4of Israel 1they shall fear].

24. And [5shall know 1the ones 2wandering 3in the 4spirit] understanding, and the ones grumbling shall learn to obey, and the [2tongues  1stuttering] shall learn to speak peace.  

## Isaiah 30

1.  Woe on Relying upon Egypt Woe, O children of defectors! Thus says the lord, You made counsel, but not through me; and treaties not by  my spirit, to add sins upon sins.

2. The ones going went down into Egypt (but of me they did not ask)  to be helped by Pharaoh, and sheltered by the Egyptians.

3. [5will be 1For 6to you 2the 3protection 4by Pharaoh] for shame, and the ones relying upon Egypt for scorn.

4. For [4are 2in 3Tanis 1chiefs 6messengers 5evil].

5. In folly they labor over a people who shall not benefit them, neither for help, nor for benefit, but for shame, and scorn. 

6.  The Vision of the Four-footed The vision of the four-footed, of the ones in the wilderness. In the affliction and in the straits are the lion and [2cub 1lion's]; from there also asps and the progeny [2asps 1of flying]; the ones who brought upon donkeys and camels  of their riches to a nation who shall not benefit them for help, but for shame and scorn.

7. The Egyptians [3in vain 4and 5with emptiness 1shall benefit 2you]. Report to them that, [4is vain  2comfort 3of yours 1This]! 

8.  The Calamitous Downfall Now then while sitting, write [2upon 3a writing-tablet 1these things], and upon a scroll, for [2shall be 3for 4times 5of days 1these things], and even into the eon.

9. For a people are resisting persuasion; [2sons 1lying] who were not willing to hear the law  of God.

10. The ones saying to the prophets, Do not announce to us! and to the ones [2the 3visions 1that see], Do not speak to us, but speak to us, and announce to us another addicting delusion,

11. and turn us from  this way! Remove from us  this road, and remove from us the oracle  of Israel!

12. On account of this, thus says the lord, the holy one  of Israel, Because you resisted persuasion  to these words, and hoped upon a lie, and that you grumbled, and [2relying 1became] upon  this word.

13. Therefore this will be to you --  this sin will be as a wall [3falling 4immediately 2city 1of a fortified] being captured, of which immediately is at hand the calamitous downfall.

14. And the calamitous downfall of it will be as the breaking of a receptacle of earthenware of [2clay vessel 1a thin], so that there should not be found among them even a potsherd in which [2coals of fire 1to lift], and with which to whistle up [2water 1a little].

15. Thus says the Lord, the lord, the holy one  of Israel, Whenever turning you should moan, then shall you be delivered. And you shall know where you were when you relied upon the vanities; [3vain  1your strength 2became], and you did not want to hear.

16. But you said, Upon horses we shall flee. On account of this you shall flee and say, [2upon 3light 4riders 1we will be]; on account of this [5nimble 4will be 1the ones 2pursuing 3you].

17. On account of [2voice 1one 4shall flee 3thousands]; and because of the voice of five [2shall flee 1many] until whenever you should be left behind as a mast upon a mountain, and as a flag borne upon a hill. 

18.  God is Merciful And again [2will wait  1God]  so as to pity you. And on account of this he shall be raised up high  to show mercy on you, because [4judge 1the lord  2your God 3is]. Blessed are all the ones adhering in him.

19. For [2people 1the holy 4in 5Zion 3shall live]. And Jerusalem in weeping wept, saying, Show mercy on me! He shall show mercy on you. [3the 4sound  5of your cry 1When 2he perceived] he heeded you.

20. The lord shall give to you bread of affliction, and [2water 1scant]. And [4no longer 5shall 6approach 7to you 1the ones 2misleading 3you]. For  your eyes shall discover the ones misleading you,

21. and  your ears shall hearken to the words of the ones following after you, misleading you. The ones saying, This is the way, we should go by it, whether right or whether left.

22. And you shall remove the idols  being silver plated; and the ones being gilded [2fine dust 1you shall make into]; and you shall winnow as the water of a woman sitting apart, and [3as 4dung 1you shall thrust 2them away].

23. Then there will be  rain for the seed  of your land; and the bread from the produce  of your land will be plenteous and lustrous; and [3shall graze 1your  2cattle] in  that day in a place fertile and broad-spaced.

24.  Your bulls and  oxen  working the ground shall eat straw being prepared from barley being winnowed.

25. And there shall be upon every [2mountain 1high], and upon every [2hill 1elevated], water traveling over in  that day, whenever [2should be destroyed 1many], and whenever [2shall fall 1towers].

26. And [5shall be 1the 2light 3of the 4moon] as the light of the sun; and the light of the sun will be seven-fold in the day whenever the lord should heal the breaking up  of his people, and [2the 3grief  4of your calamity 1shall heal]. 

27.  Burning Rage Behold, the name the lord comes after [2time 1a long], burning rage with glory. The oracle  of his lips is an oracle [2of anger 1full], and the anger  of his rage [2as 3fire 1shall devour].

28. And  his breath, as water [2in 3a ravine 1being dragged along], shall come unto the neck, and be divided. He shall disturb nations for [2addiction to a delusion 1a vain], and [2shall pursue 3them 1an addiction to a delusion], and it shall take them according to their face.

29.  [3always 1Must 2you] be glad and enter into  my holy places always, as the ones solemnizing a holiday? and as ones being glad to enter with a pipe, into the mountain of the lord, to the God  of Israel?

30. And [3audible 2will make 1the lord] the glory  of his voice; and the rage  of his arm he will show with rage and anger. And as a flame devouring he shall strike with a thunderbolt violently; even as water and hail being carried together by force.

31. For by the voice of the lord the Assyrians shall be vanquished, even by the calamity in which he should strike them.

32. And it will be to him round about, from where was to him  hope  for help, upon whom he relied upon; they with tambourines and harps shall wage war on him from out of revolt.

33. For you [2before 3some days 1shall be exacted]; not also for you was it prepared to reign? [2ravine 1a deep], wood being situated near a fire, and [2wood 1much]; the rage of the lord as a ravine [2under 3sulphur 1burning].  

## Isaiah 31

1.  The Vanity of Relying upon Egypt Woe to the ones going down into Egypt for help; the ones [2upon 3horses 1relying], and upon chariots, for they are many; and relying upon [3horses 2many 1exceedingly]. And they did not hearken relying upon the holy one  of Israel, and  [3God 1they did not 2seek].

2. And he wisely brought upon them bad things, and  his word in no way shall be annulled. And he shall rise up against the houses [2men 1of wicked], and against  [3hope 1their  2vain] --

3. an Egyptian man, and not God. Their horses are flesh and not help; but the lord shall bring  his hand against them, and [3shall tire 1the ones 2helping], and together all will perish.

4. For thus said the lord to me, In which manner whenever [6should yell out 1the 2lion 3or 4the 5cub] over the game which he took, and shall cry out over it, until whenever [3should be filled up 1the 2mountains]  of his voice, and the prey are vanquished, and by the magnitude  of rage they are scared; so [3shall go down 1the lord 2of Hosts] to march upon  mount Zion, upon  her mountains.

5. As birds flying, so shall [3shield 1the lord 2of Hosts] above Jerusalem; and he shall rescue and shall protect and shall deliver.

6. Turn! O ones  [2deep 5counsel 1consulting 3and 4lawless], O sons of Israel.

7. For  in that day [2shall totally reject  1men] the idols made by their hands -- the things made of silver, and the things of gold, which [2made  1their hands]. 

8.  The Fall of Assyria And Assyria shall fall; not by the sword of man, nor [2the sword 3of man 1shall] devour him; and he will not flee from in front of the sword; but the young men shall be for vanquishing;

9. for as a rock, they shall be taken hold of as for a siege mound, and shall be vanquished; but the one fleeing shall be captured; thus says the lord, Blessed is the one who has [2in 3Zion 1a seed], and members of a family in Jerusalem.  

## Isaiah 32

1.  The Just King For behold [2king 1a just] shall reign, and rulers with judgment shall rule.

2. And [3shall be 1the 2man] hiding  his words, and they shall be hid as of water being brought; and it shall be shone forth in Zion as a river being brought along, glorious in [2land 1a thirsting].

3. And no longer will they be relying upon men, but the ears they shall give to hear.

4. And  the heart of the ones being weak shall take heed  to hear; and the tongues stuttering, quickly they shall learn to speak peace.

5. And no longer shall they tell the moron to rule; and no longer shall [2say  1your officers], You be quiet!

6. For the moron [2moronish 1shall speak], and  his heart [2vanities 1shall purpose],  to complete lawless deeds, and to speak [2against 3the lord 1a delusion],  to scatter [2souls 1hungering], and [3for the 5souls  4thirsting 2vain things 1causing].

7. For the counsel of the wicked [2lawless deeds 1shall plan] to corrupt the lowly by [2words 1unjust], and to efface the words of the lowly in a case.

8. But the pious [2the discerning 1consult], and this  counsel shall abide. 

9.  Works of Righteousness Shall Be Peace [3women 2rich 1Rise up], and hear  my voice! [3O daughters 4in 5hope 1Listen to 2my words]!

10. [3for the days 4of a year 2mention 1Make] in grief, yet with hope! [2has been consumed  1The gathering of crops], [3has ceased 1the 2sowing], and no longer should it come.

11. Be amazed! Let [3fret 1the ones 2persuading]! Strip! [2naked 1Become]! Gird the loins!

12. and [2upon 3the 4breasts 1beat]! because of [2field 1the desirable], and [2of the grapevine 1the produce].

13. The land  of my people is a thorn-bush; and grass shall ascend, and from out of every house gladness shall be lifted away.

14. The houses are being abandoned; [2the riches 3of the city 1they shall leave] and [2houses 1desirable]. And [3will be 1the 2towns] caves unto the eon, a gladness [2donkeys 1for wild], pastures for shepherds;

15. until whenever [4should come 5upon 6you 1spirit 2from 3on high]; and [3shall be 4wilderness 1the 2fruitful field], and the fruitful field [2as 3a forest 1shall be considered].

16. And [2shall rest 3in 4the 5wilderness 1judgment], and righteousness [2in  3Carmel 1shall dwell].

17. And [4shall be 1the 2works  3of righteousness] peace; and [2shall reach  1righteousness] rest, and the ones relying shall be unto the eon.

18. And [2shall dwell  1his people] in a city of peace, and shall dwell in it being yielded up; and they shall rest with riches.

19.  And if hail should come down, [2not 4upon 5you 1it will 3come]. And [6will be 1the ones 2dwelling 3in 4the 5forests] yielding as the ones in the plain.

20. Blessed are the ones sowing by every water where the ox and donkey tread.  

## Isaiah 33

1.  After Affliction Comes Deliverance Woe to the ones causing misery, [4you 1but 2no one 3makes] miserable; and the one disrespecting you, does not disrespect; [3shall be captured 1the ones 2disrespecting], and they shall be delivered up; and as a moth upon a cloak, so they shall be vanquished.

2. O lord, show mercy on us! [3upon 4you 1for 2we rely]. [5became 1The 2seed 3of the ones 4resisting persuasion] for destruction;  but our deliverance is in time of affliction.

3. On account of the sound  of the fear of you [2were amazed 1peoples]. [5because of 6the 7fear 8of you 1and 4were dispersed 2the 3nations].

4. But now [2shall be gathered  1your spoils], small and great; in which manner as if one should gather locusts, so they shall mock you.

5. Holy is the God  dwelling in heavens. Zion shall be filled up with equity and righteousness.

6. [2to 3the law 1They shall be delivered up]. [2is in 3treasuries  1Our deliverance]. Located there are wisdom and higher knowledge and piety to the lord; these are treasuries of righteousness.

7. Behold indeed, in the fear of you these shall be fearful. Whom you feared shall yell out because of you; for messengers shall be sent enjoining for peace, bitterly weeping.

8. [5shall be made desolate 1For 2the 4of these 3ways]. [5has been made to cease 1Your 2fear 3of the 4nations], and the covenant is lifted away, and in no way shall you consider them men.

9. [3mourned 1The 2land]. Lebanon is ashamed. [3marshes 2became  1Sharon]. [3of distinction 2will be  1Galilee], and  Carmel.

10. Now I shall rise up, says the lord. Now I shall be glorified, now I shall be exalted,

11. now you shall see, now you shall perceive, [5in vain 4shall be 1the 2strength  3of your spirit]; fire shall devour you.

12. And [2shall be 1the nations] for incinerating as a thorn-bush in a field being tossed and being incinerated.

13. [3shall hear 1The ones 2at a distance] what I did; and [3shall know 1the ones 2approaching]  my strength.

14. [5departed 1The 3in 4Zion 2lawless ones]. [2shall take 1Trembling] the impious. Who shall announce to you that a fire is being burned? Who shall announce to you the [2place  1eternal]?

15. The one going in righteousness, speaking the straight way, detesting lawlessness and injustice, and [3with the 4hands 1shaking off  2bribes], weighing down the ears that he should not hear a judgment of blood, closing the eyelids of the eyes that he should not behold injustice.

16. This one shall live in a high cave [2rocks 1of strong]; bread shall be given to him, and  his water is trustworthy. 

17.  Future Zion [2a king 3with 4glory 1You shall see], and  your eyes shall see a land at a distance.

18.  Your soul shall meditate upon fear. Where are the academics? Where are the ones advising? Where is the one counting the ones being maintained?

19. A small and great people which did not take advice, nor had beheld a deep voice, so that [3should not 4hear 1a people 2being treated as worthless], and there is no [2to the one 3hearing 1understanding].

20. Behold, Zion the city,  our deliverance.  Your eyes shall see Jerusalem, [2city 1a rich], tents which in no way shall be shaken, nor shall [4be moved 1the 2stanchions  3of her tent] into the eon of time, nor  [3her rough cords 1in any way 2shall] be torn up.

21. For the name of the lord [2great 3to you 1will be]; with rivers and [4aqueducts 1spacious 2and 3broad]. You shall not go this  way, nor shall [3go 1a boat 2being rowed].

22.  For my God is great; [2shall not 3pass me by 1the lord]; the lord our judge; the lord our ruler; the lord our king; the lord himself shall deliver us.

23. [2were torn  1Your rough cords], for [2does not 3have strength 1your mast], it leans, it shall not let down the shrouds, it shall not lift a signal flag until of which time it should be delivered up for plunder; therefore many lame men [2plunder 1shall cause].

24. And in no way shall [6say 7I am tired 1the 2people  3dwelling 4in 5her], [3shall be forgiven 1for 4to them  2sin].  

## Isaiah 34

1.  Judgment on the Nations Lead forward, O nations, and hearken, O rulers! Hear, O earth and the ones [2in 3it 1living]; O world, and the people  in it!

2. Because the rage of the lord is upon all the nations, and his anger is upon  their number,  to destroy them and to deliver them up unto slaughter.

3. And the slain ones of theirs shall be tossed forth, and the dead ones. And [3of them shall ascend 1the 2scent], and [3shall be rained upon 1the 2mountains] by  their blood.

4. And [6shall melt away 1all 2the 3powers 4of the 5heavens]. And [3shall coil up 1the 2heaven] as a scroll, and all the stars shall fall as leaves fall from a grapevine, and as [2fall 1leaves] from a fig-tree.

5. For [2was intoxicated  1my sword] in the heaven. Behold, [2upon  3Edom 1it shall go down], and upon the people of the destruction with judgment.

6. The sword of the lord was filled of blood thickened from the fat of lambs, and from the fat of he-goats and rams; for a sacrifice  to God is in Bosor, and [2slaughter 1a great] in  Edom.

7. And [3shall be cast down 1the 2stout men] with them, and the rams and the bulls. And [3will be intoxicated 1the 2earth] from the blood, even  their embankment; and [2of  3their fat 1they shall be filled up]. 

8.  Day of Judgment For it is a day of judgment of the lord, and the year of recompense of judgment of Zion.

9. And [2shall be turned  1her ravines] into pitch; and  her land into sulphur; and [2will be  1her land 3in 5pitch 4burning]

10. night and day; and it shall not be extinguished into the eon of time. And [2shall ascend  1her smoke] upward; unto her generations she shall be made desolate, and for [2time 1a long] she shall be made desolate.

11. Birds, and hedgehogs, and ibises, and crows shall dwell in her; and [4shall be put 5upon 6her 2cord 1a surveying 3of desolation]; and satyrs shall live in her.

12.  Her rulers will not be;  for her kings and  her great men will be for destruction.

13. And [3shall grow up 4in  5their cities 1thorny 2woods], and also in  her fortresses; and they will be properties of sirens, and a courtyard of ostriches.

14. And [2shall meet with 1demons] satyrs; and they shall yell another to the other; [3there 2shall rest 1satyrs], for they found for themselves a place of rest.

15. [3there 2shall nest 1The hedgehog], and [3preserved 1the 2earth]  her children with safety; there stags meet together, and beheld the faces of one another.

16. [2in number 1They go by], and [2one 3of them 1not] perished; the other [3the 4other 1did not 2seek]; for the lord gave charge to them, and  his spirit gathered them.

17. And he shall cast lots for them, and  his hand divided out parts to them to graze. Into the eon of time you shall inherit; for generations of generations shall rest upon it.  

## Isaiah 35

1.  The Lord Himself shall Come Be glad, [2wilderness 1O thirsting]! Exult, O wilderness, and bloom as a lily!

2. And [5shall blossom 6and 7exult 1the 2desolate places 3of the 4Jordan]. The glory  of Lebanon was given to it, and the honor  of Carmel. And  my people shall see the glory of the lord, and the stature  of God.

3. Be strong! O hands being forsaken, and knees being disabled.

4. Take comfort! O faint-hearted in mind. Be strong! Do not fear! Behold,  our God [2judgment 1recompenses], and he will recompense. He himself shall come, and he shall deliver us.

5. Then shall [3be opened 1the eyes 2of the blind], and the ears of the deaf shall hear.

6. Then [3shall leap 4as 5a stag 1the 2lame], and [3will be plain 1the tongue 2of the stammering]; for [2was torn forth 3in 4the 5wilderness 1water], and a ravine in [2land 1a thirsting].

7. And [3will be 1the 2waterless place] turned into marshes, and [4into 1the 2thirsting 3land] a spring of water. There will be there a gladness of birds, properties of reed and marshes.

8. There will be there [2way 1a pure], and [3way 2a holy 1it shall be called]; and in no way shall [2pass by 3there 1anything unclean]; nor shall there be there [2way 1an unclean]. But the ones having been scattered shall go upon it, and in no way shall they wander.

9. And there will not be [2there 1a lion]. Nor the ferocious wild beasts in any way shall ascend unto it, nor even should be found there. But [2shall go 3in 4it 1the ones being ransomed],

10. even ones being gathered together by the lord. And they shall return, and shall come to Zion with gladness; even [2gladness 1eternal] is upon their head. For upon  their head is praise and a leap for joy. And gladness shall overtake them; [6ran away 1grief 2and 3distress 4and 5moaning].  

## Isaiah 36

1.  Sennacherib Ascends to Judah And it came to pass the fourteenth year of the reigning of Hezekiah, [4ascended 1Sennacherib 2king 3of the Assyrians] upon the [2cities  3of Judea  1fortified], and took them.

2. And [3sent 1the king 2of the Assyrians]  Rabshakeh from Lachish unto Jerusalem to  king Hezekiah with [2force 1a great]. And he stood by the aqueduct of the [2pool  1upper] in the way of the field of the fuller.

3. And there came forth to him, Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah the manager, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.

4. And [2said 3to them 1Rabshakeh], Speak  to Hezekiah! Thus says the [2king  1great], the king of the Assyrians. What are you relying on?

5. Does [3by 4a plan 5with the 6words 7of the lips 1the battle 2take place]? And now, upon whom are you relying that you resist my persuasion?

6. Behold, you are relying upon  [2rod  3of reed  1this fractured] -- upon Egypt; which if [2should stay his weight 1a man] upon it, it shall enter into  his hand, and shall puncture it. Thus is Pharaoh king of Egypt, and all the ones relying upon him.

7. And if you should say, Upon the lord  our God we rely on. [2not 1Is he] whom Hezekiah removed  his high places, and  his altars, and told  Judah and  Jerusalem, In front  of this altar do obesiance now!

8. But mix in with  my master the king of the Assyrians, and I will give to you two thousand horses, if you are able to put riders upon them.

9. And how are you all able to turn to the face of the toparchs? [10our servants 9are 1The ones 2relying 3upon 4the Egyptians 5for 6a horse 7and 8rider].

10. And now, have [2without 3the lord 1we ascended] upon  this place to wage war with it? The lord said to me, Ascend upon  this land, and utterly destroy it!

11. And [6said 7to 8him 1Eliakim 2and 3Shebna 4and 5Joah], to Rabshakeh, Speak indeed to  your servants in Syriac! for we hear ourselves; and do not speak to us in Jewish! For why do you speak unto the ears of the men  standing upon the wall?

12. And [2said 3to 4them 1Rabshakeh], Is it to  your master, or to you [2sent 3me  1my master] to speak  these words? Is it not to the men, the ones sitting upon the wall, that they should eat  their dung and drink  their urine with you together?

13. And Rabshakeh stood and yelled out [2voice 1with a great] in Jewish, and said, Hearken to indeed the words of the [2king  1great], the king of the Assyrians!

14. Thus says the king, Do not let [2deceive 3you 1Hezekiah] with words! in no way shall he be able to rescue you.

15. And do not let [2say 3to you 1Hezekiah] that, [2shall rescue 3you  1God], and in no way shall [2be delivered  1this city] into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.

16. Do not hearken to Hezekiah! Thus says the king of the Assyrians, If you want to be blessed, come forth to me! and you shall [2eat 1each]  of his own grapevine and  fig-trees, and shall drink water from out of  his own well;

17. until whenever I should come and should take you into a land as  your land; a land of grain, and wine, and bread loaves, and vineyards.

18. Let not [2deceive 3you 1Hezekiah]! saying,  God shall rescue us. Have [6rescued 1the 2gods 3of the 4nations 5each]  his own place from out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?

19. Where is the god of Hamath and Arpad? And where is the god of the city of Sepharvaim? Have they been able to rescue  Samaria from out of my hand?

20. Which of the gods of all  these nations is the one who was rescued  of his land from out of my hand, that [2shall rescue 1the lord] Jerusalem from out of my hand?

21. And they kept silent, and no one answered him a word by the assignment of the king, saying, No one is to answer.

22. And [7entered 1Eliakim 2the 3son of 4Helkiah 5the 6manager], and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah, having split their inner garments. And they announced to him the words of Rabshakeh.  

## Isaiah 37

1.  Hezekiah Inquires of The LORD And it came to pass in  [3hearing  1king 2Hezekiah], that he split  his garments, and put on sackcloth, and ascended unto the house of the lord.

2. And he sent  Eliakim the manager, and Shebna the scribe (with the elders of the priests putting on sackcloths) to Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet.

3. And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, A day of affliction, and scorning, and rebuke, and anger  is today's day. For [4come 1the 2pangs  3of giving birth], [4strength 1but 2she does not 3have]  to give birth.

4. If by any means [3may listen to 1the lord  2your God] the words of Rabshakeh, whom [4sent 2the king 3of the Assyrians  1his master] to berate [2God 1the living], and to berate by the words which [3heard 1the lord  2your God], therefore you shall make beseechment to the lord  your God concerning  these being left.

5. And [5came 1the 2servants  3of king 4Hezekiah] to Isaiah.

6. And [2said 3to them 1Isaiah], Thus you shall say to  your master, Thus says the lord, You should not be fearful of the words which you heard, which [5berated 6me 1the 2ambassadors 3of the king 4of the Assyrians].

7. Behold, I shall put upon him a spirit, and hearing a message he shall return unto  his place, and he shall fall by the sword in  his land.

8. And Rabshakeh returned, and overtook the king of the Assyrians while assaulting Libna, for he heard that he departed from Lachish.

9. And there came forth Tirhakah king of the Ethiopians  to assault him; and hearing he returned and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king  of Judea, Let not [2deceive 3you  1your God]! upon whom you rely upon him, saying, In no way shall Jerusalem be delivered up into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.

11. Behold, have you not heard what [3did 1the kings 2of the Assyrians], [3the whole  4earth 1how 2they destroyed]? and shall you be rescued?

12. Have [5rescued 6them 1the 2gods 3of the 4nations] whom [2destroyed  1my fathers],  both Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, which are in the place of Telassar?

13. Where are the kings of Hamath? and where is Arphad? and where is the city Sepharvaim, Henah and Ivah? 

14.  The Prayer of Hezekiah And Hezekiah took the scroll from the messengers, and read it. And he ascended into the house of the lord, and opened it before the lord.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to the lord, saying,

16. O lord of Hosts,  God of Israel, the one sitting upon the cherubim. You are  God alone of every kingdom of the world. You made the heaven and the earth.

17. Lean, O lord,  your ear! Hearken, O lord! Open, O lord,  your eyes! Look in, O lord, and know and hear all the words of Sennacherib! which he sent to berate [2God 1the living].

18. [2in 3truth 1For], O lord, [3made desolate 1the kings 2of the Assyrians] the [2inhabitable world 1entire], and  their region.

19. And they raised  their idols unto the fire, [3not 1for 4gods 2they were], but works of the hands of men, wood and stones -- and they destroyed them.

20. But now, O lord  our God, deliver us from out of his hand! that [5should know 1every 2kingdom 3of the 4earth] that you are  God alone.

21. And [4was sent 1Isaiah 2son 3of Amoz] to Hezekiah. And he said to him, Thus says the lord  God of Israel, I heard what you prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of the Assyrians.

22. This is the word which [2spoke 3concerning 4him  1God]; [4treated you as worthless 5and 6sneered at 7you 1The virgin 2daughter 3of Zion]; [5against 6you 4her head 3shook 1the daughter 2of Jerusalem].

23. Whom did you berate and provoke? or, to whom did you raise up high  your voice and lift [2unto 3the height  1your eyes] against the holy one  of Israel?

24. For through messengers you berated the lord. For you said, With the multitude  of chariots I shall ascend unto the height of mountains, and into the ends  of Lebanon; and I felled the height of its cedar, and the beauty of the cypress; and I entered unto the height of the portion of the forest;

25. and I made a dam, and made desolate the waters and every gathering of water.

26. Have you not heard these things [4earlier 1which 2I 3did]? From [2days 1ancient] I ordered it. But now I displayed to make [4desolate 1nations 2in 3fortified places], and the ones living in [2cities 1fortified].

27. I weakened the hands, and they were dried up; and they became as [2grass 1dry] upon the roofs, and as wild grass.

28. But now  [3your rest 4and  5your exit 6and  7your entrance 1I 2know],

29.  and your rage which you were enraged. And  your bitterness ascended to me. And I will put a rein into  your nose, and a bit into  your lips, and I will return you in the way in which you came by it.

30. And this [3to you 1is the 2sign], Eat this  year what you have sown; and the [2year  1second] the vestige left; and the third year, sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat  of their fruit!

31. And they shall be the ones being left behind in  Judea. They shall germinate a root below, and they shall produce grain upward.

32. For from out of Jerusalem shall come forth the ones surviving, and the ones being preserved from out of mount Zion. The zeal of the lord of Hosts shall do these things. 

33.  The Angel Slays the Assyrians Therefore thus says the lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, In no way shall he enter into  this city, nor throw [2against 3it 1an arrow], nor shall he put [2against 3it 1a shield], nor shall he encircle [2against 3it 1a siege mound].

34. But in the way in which he came by it, he shall return; and [3into  4this city 1in no way 2shall he enter]. Thus says the lord.

35. I will shield over  this city  to deliver it, because of myself and because of David  my servant.

36. And [3came forth 1an angel 2of the lord], and he did away with the camp of the Assyrians -- a hundred eighty-five thousand. And rising up in the morning he found all the [2bodies 1dead].

37. And he went forth returning. And [4returned 1Sennacherib 2king 3of the Assyrians], and lived in Nineveh.

38. And while  he did obeisance in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer  his sons struck him with swords; and they came through safe into Armenia. And [3took reign 1Esar-haddon  2his son] instead of him.  

## Isaiah 38

1.  The Infirmity of Hezekiah And it came to pass in  that time Hezekiah was infirm unto death. And there came to him Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet; and he said to him, Thus says the lord, Give orders concerning  your house! [3die 1for 2you], and shall not live.

2. And Hezekiah turned  his face to the wall, and prayed to the lord,

3. saying, Remember, O lord, as I was gone before you with truth, in [2heart 1a true], and the things pleasing before you I did. And Hezekiah wept [2weeping 1with great].

4. And [3came 1the word 2of the lord] to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the lord, the God of David  your father; I heard  your prayer, and beheld  your tears. Behold, I add to  your time fifteen years.

6. And from out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians I shall rescue you, and  this city; and I shall shield over  this city.

7. And this [3to you 1is the 2sign] from the lord, that [2will do  1God]  this thing which he said.

8. Behold, I shall turn the shadow of the stairs which [3went down 4the 5ten 6stairs 7of the 8house  9of your father 1the 2sun]. I will return the sun the ten stairs which [3went down 1the 2shadow]. 

9.  Prayer of Hezekiah The prayer of Hezekiah king  of Judea when he was infirm and he rose up from  his infirmity.

10. I said in the height  of my days, I shall go to the gates of Hades; I shall forsake the years  remaining.

11. I said, No longer in any way shall I behold the deliverance  of God upon the land of the living. No longer in any way shall I behold a man with ones inhabiting.

12. I failed my kin; I forsook the rest  of my life; it departed and went forth from me as the one resting up [2a tent 1pitching].  My spirit in me became as the web of one working in wool approaching to cut it off.

13. In  that day I was delivered over until morning. As a lion so he broke all  my bones. For from the day until the night I was delivered over.

14. As a swallow, so shall I call out, and as a dove, so shall I meditate. [4failed 1For 2my  3eyes]  to see into the height of the heaven, to the lord who rescued me.

15. And he removed [3of my 1the 2grief]  soul, and he acted.

16. O lord, [2concerning 3this 1for] it was announced to you, and you awakened my  breath, and being comforted I live.

17. Behold, being in peace was bitter for me. For you took up my  soul, that it should not perish; and you threw away [3behind 4me 1all  2my sins].

18. [6not 1For 2the ones 3in 4Hades 5shall] praise you; nor the ones dying shall bless you; nor shall [4hope 1the ones 2in 3Hades]  on your charity.

19. The living shall bless you in which manner as I; for from  today [2children 1I shall produce] who shall announce  your righteousness,

20. O lord  of my deliverance; even I will not cease blessing you with the psaltery all the days  of my life, before the house  of God.

21. And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Take a dried cluster of figs, and grind them, and plaster with it, and [2in health 1you will be].

22. And Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I shall ascend into the house  of God.  

## Isaiah 39

1.  Hezekiah Reveals the Treasures In  that time [9sent 1Merodach 2Baladan 3the 4son  5of Baladan 6the 7king  8of Babylonia] letters, and ambassadors, and gifts to Hezekiah; for he heard that he was infirm unto death, and was raised up.

2. And [2rejoiced 3over 4them 1Hezekiah 6joy 5with a great]. And he showed to them the house of the spices, and of the silver, and of the gold, and of the balsam, and of the incenses, and of the perfumed liquid, and all the houses of the items of the treasury, and all as much as was in  his treasuries. And there was not one thing which [2did not 3show 4to them 1Hezekiah] in  his house.

3. And [4came 1Isaiah 2the 3prophet] to  king Hezekiah, and he said to him, What did [2say  1these men]? And from what place have they come to you? And Hezekiah said, From a land at a distance -- they have come to me from Babylon.

4. And Isaiah said, What did they see in  your house? And Hezekiah said, All the things in  my house they beheld; and there is not anything in  my house which they did not behold; but even the things in  my treasuries.

5. And Isaiah said to him, Hear the word of the lord of Hosts!

6. Behold, days come, and they shall take all the things in  your house; even as much as [2brought together  1your fathers] until  this day -- [2unto 3Babylon 1it shall come], and not one thing in any way shall be left behind. [3said 1and  2God],

7. that, Also of  your children whom you engendered they shall take; and they shall be made castrati in the house of the king of the Babylonians.

8. And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, [4is good 1the 2word 3of the lord] which you spoke; let there be indeed peace and righteousness in  my days!  

## Isaiah 40

1.  A Voice Yelling in the Wilderness Take comfort! take comfort! my people, says  your God.

2. O priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem! Comfort her! for [2was filled up  1her humiliation]; [3is untied 1her  2sin]; for she received from the hand of the lord double  her sins.

3. A voice yelling in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the lord! [2straight 1Make] the roads  of our God!

4. Every ravine shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be lowered; and [4shall be 1all 2the 3crooked paths] for straight, and the rough into [2plains 1smooth].

5. And [4shall be seen 1the 2glory 3of the lord]; and [3shall see 1all 2flesh] the deliverance  of God, for the lord said it.

6. A voice saying, Yell! And I said, What shall I yell? All flesh is as grass, and all glory of man is as the flower of grass.

7. [3is dried 1The 2grass], and the flower fell off, for breath of God breathed in it. Truly the grass is the people.

8. [3is dried 1The 2grass], the flower fell off, but the word  of our God abides into the eon.

9. [2upon 4mountain 3the high 1Ascend]! O one announcing good news of Zion. Raise up high in the strength  of your voice! O one announcing good news of Jerusalem. Raise it up high! Do not fear! Say to the cities of Judah! Behold,  your God.

10. Behold, the Lord. The lord [2with 3strength 1comes], even the arm with dominion. Behold,  his wage is with him, and the work before him.

11. As a shepherd, he shall tend  his flock; and  his arm shall gather the lambs, and [3one in 4the womb 2the one having 1he shall comfort]. 

12.  Israel's Incomparable God Who measured [3with the 4hand 1the 2water], and the heaven with a span, and all the earth in a handful? Who established the mountains weight, and the groves in a yoke balance scale?

13. Who knew the mind of the lord? and who [2his 3counselor 1became]? Who shall instruct him?

14. Or whom did he take up advice with, and instructed him? Or who showed to him equity? Or [4a way 5of understanding 1who 2showed 3to him]?

15. Since all the nations [2as 3a drop 4from 5a pail 6and 7as 8the crux 9of a yoke balance scale 1were considered]; and [2as 3saliva 1they are considered].

16.  And Lebanon is not fit for burning, and all the four-footed are not fit for a whole offering;

17. and all the nations [2as 3nothing 1are], and [2as 3nothing 1were considered] to him.

18. To whom did you liken the lord, and to what representation did you liken him?

19. Has not [3an image 2made 1the fabricator]? or the goldsmith having cast gold, gilt it over, [3for a representation 1and carefully prepared 2it]?

20. [5wood 1For 4incorruptible 3chooses 2the fabricator], and wisely seeks how to station his image, that it should not be shaken.

21. Will you not know? Will you not hear? Was it not announced from the beginning to you? Did you not know the foundations of the earth?

22. He is the one controlling the curve of the earth, and the ones dwelling in it are as locusts; He is the one establishing [3as 4a vault 1the 2heaven], and extending it out as a tent to dwell in;

23. the one establishing rulers [2as 3nothing 1to rule]; [3the 1and 4earth 5as 6nothing 2he made].

24. For in no way shall they plant, nor shall they sow, nor shall they be rooted in the earth  of their root. He breathed upon them, and they were dried up; and a blast [3as 4sticks 1shall take 2them away].

25. Now then, to whom did you liken me that I shall be exalted, said the holy one?

26. Look up into the height  with your eyes, and behold! Who introduced all these things? The one bringing forth [2by 3number  1his cosmos] [2all things 3by 4name 1shall call] by great glory, and by the might of strength. Nothing of which you are unaware.

27. [3not 1For 2you should] say, O Jacob, and why did you speak, O Israel, saying, [2was concealed  1My way] from  God, and  my God  [2judgment 1removed], and departed.

28. And now, did you not know? Have you not heard? [2God 1the eternal], the God  carefully preparing the tips of the earth, he shall not hunger nor tire, nor is there a finding out  of his intelligence;

29. giving [2to the ones 3hungering 1strength], and [2to the ones 3not 4grieving 1distress].

30. [3shall hunger 1For 2younger men], and [2shall tire 1the young], and the chosen men [2without strength 1will be].

31. But the ones waiting upon  God shall change in strength; they shall grow wings as eagles; they shall run and shall not tire; they shall proceed and shall not hunger.  

## Isaiah 41

1.  The LORD Strengthens Israel Dedicate a feast to me, O islands, for the rulers shall change strength. Let them approach and speak together, then [2judgment 1let them announce]!

2. Who awakened [2from 3the east 1righteousness], called it by his feet, and it shall go? He shall appoint against nations, and [2kings 1he shall recede], and he shall put [2into 3the earth  1their swords], and [2as 3sticks 4being pushed out  1their bows].

3. And he shall pursue them; [4shall go through 5in 6peace 1the 2way  3of his feet].

4. Who exerted energy and did these things? He called her -- the one calling her from [2of generations 1the beginning]; I  God, the first and into the coming, I am.

5. [2beheld 1Nations] and they feared; the tips of the earth are startled; they approached and came together,

6. judging each for the neighbor, and [2for the 3brother 1helping]; and shall say,

7. [2was strong 1The man] -- the fabricator, and the brazier beating with a hammer [2together 1forging]; how long then shall he say, The coupling is good, they strengthened them with nails; they shall establish them, and it shall not be moved.

8. But you, O Israel my servant, Jacob whom I chose, seed of Abraham whom I loved;

9. whom I took hold of from the uttermost parts of the earth; and from out of  its heights I called you; and I said to you, [2servant 1You are my]; I chose you, and I did not abandon you.

10. Do not fear! [3with 4you 1for 2I am]. Do not wander! for I am  your God; the one strengthening you, and I will give help to you, and safeguard you  [2right hand  1by my just].

11. Behold, [3shall be ashamed 4and 5shall be respectful 1all  2your adversaries], for they will be as not existing; and [3shall perish 1all  2your opponents].

12. You shall seek them, and in no way shall you find the men who shall insult while drunk with wine against you; for they shall be as ones not being; and [4shall not 5be 1the ones 2waging war against 3you].

13. For I am  your God, the one holding  your right hand, the one saying to you,

14. Do not fear, O Jacob, O Israel, very few in number! I gave help to you, says  your God, the one ransoming you, O Israel.

15. Behold, I made you as wheels of a wagon threshing -- new, toothed; and you shall thresh the mountains, and shall thin out the hills, and [2as 3dust 1make them].

16. And you shall winnow them, and a wind shall take them, and the gale shall scatter them. But you shall be glad among the holy ones of Israel.

17. And [6will exult 1the 2poor 3and 4the ones 5lacking]; for they shall seek water and none will be;  their tongue [2from 3the 4thirst 1was dried up]. I the lord shall heed, the God of Israel, and I will not abandon them.

18. But I will open [2upon 3the 4mountains 1rivers], and [2in 3the midst 4of plains 1springs]; I will make the wilderness into marshes of waters, and the thirsting ground in aqueducts.

19. I will put into the waterless earth the cedar and boxwood, and myrtle, and cypress, and white poplar;

20. that they should behold, and should know, and should reflect on, and should have knowledge of together that the hand of the lord did these things, and the holy one  of Israel introduced them.

21. [2approaches  1Your judgment], says the lord  God; [2approached  1your counsels], says the king of Jacob.

22. Let them approach and announce to you! what shall come to pass, or the things prior to what it was you said. And we will attend  our mind, and we shall know what the last things and the ones coming are.

23. Tell to us! announce the things coming at the latter end! and we shall know that you are gods. [2good 1Do] and do evil! and we shall wonder, and we shall see at the same time;

24. for from what place you are, and from what place  your work is from; [4out of 5the earth 3an abomination 1they chose 2you].

25. But I raised up the one from the north, and the one from the sun eastward; they shall be called  by my name; let [2come 1the rulers]! and as clay of a potter, and as a potter trampling down the clay, so you shall be trampled.

26. For who shall announce the things from the beginning, that we should know also the things happening before, and we shall say that they are true? There is not the one speaking beforehand, nor one hearing your  words.

27. [2sovereignty 3to Zion 1I will give], and I will comfort Jerusalem in the way.

28. For from the nations, behold, there was no one; and from  their idols there was not  one announcing. And if I should ask them, From what place are you? in no way should they answer me.

29. For they are the ones making you, so you say, and in folly ones misleading you.  

## Isaiah 42

1.  The Servant of The LORD Jacob,  my child, I shall take hold of him. Israel,  my chosen, [2favorably received 3him  1my soul]. I have put  my spirit upon him, [2judgment 3to the 4nations 1he shall bring forth].

2. He shall not cry out, nor shall he send up his voice, nor shall [2be heard 3outside  1his voice].

3. A reed being crushed he will not break, and [2flax 1smoking] he will not extinguish; but to validity he will bring forth judgment.

4. He shall illuminate, and shall not be devastated until whenever he should set [2upon 3the 4earth 1judgment]. And upon  his name nations shall hope.

5. Thus says the lord  God, the one making the heaven, and pitching it; solidifying the earth, and the things in it; and giving breath to the people  upon it, and spirit to the ones treading it.

6. I the lord  God called you in righteousness, and I shall hold  your hand, and I will strengthen you; and I gave you for a covenant of a race, for a light of nations;

7. to open the eyes of the blind, to lead out of bonds ones being tied; from out of the house of prison also ones sitting in darkness.

8. I am the lord  God; this is my  name;  [3my glory 4to another 1I will not 2give], nor  my virtues to the carvings.

9. The things from the beginning, behold, they have come, and the new things which I shall announce, even before the announcing, it was made manifest to you. 

10.  A Song of Praise Sing to the lord [2hymn 1a new]! Glorify  his name from the uttermost part of the earth! O ones going down into the sea, and sailing it; the islands, and the ones dwelling in them.

11. Be glad, O wilderness and  her towns, properties, and the ones dwelling in Kedar! [4shall be glad 1The ones 2dwelling in 3the rock]. From the tip of the mountains they shall yell.

12. They shall give  [2to God 1glory];  [2his virtues 3in 4the 5islands 1they shall report].

13. The lord  God of the forces shall go forth, and shall break war. He shall rouse zeal, and shall yell against  his enemies with strength.

14. I kept silent from the eon; shall I also continually keep silent and endure? As the woman giving birth perseveres, I will now amaze and dry out at the same time.

15. I will make [4desolate 1mountains 2and 3hills], and [2all  3their grass 1will dry out]. And I will make rivers into islands, and marshes to dry land.

16. And I will lead the blind in the way which they knew not, and [4roads 5which 6they had not 7seen 3to tread 1I will cause 2them]. I will make for them darkness into light, and crooked into straight. These are the things I will do to them, and I shall not abandon them.

17. But they were turned into the rear. You should be ashamed with shame, O ones relying upon the carvings, O ones saying to the molten images, You are our gods. 

18.  The Blindness of Israel O deaf-mutes, hear! and O blind, look up to behold!

19. And who is blind, but  my servants? And who are deaf-mutes, but the ones dominating them? Who is blind as the one receiving? even [4were blinded 1the 2servants  3of God].

20. You beheld many times, and watched not; opening the ears, and heard not.

21. The lord  God willed that he should be justified, and should magnify praise.

22. And I beheld, and it came to pass the people were being despoiled and plundered; for the snare is in the storerooms everywhere, and in the houses together where they hid them; they became for plunder, and there was not the one rescuing one seized; and there was not the one saying, Give back!

23. Who among you shall give ear to these things which shall be heard for the things coming about?

24. Who gave [2for 3ravaging 1Jacob], and Israel to the ones plundering? Was it not  God to whom they sinned? And they did not want [2in  3his ways 1to go], nor to hear  his law.

25. And he brought upon them the anger of his rage; and [2strengthened 3against them 1the war] and the ones burning them round about; and [3did not 4know 1each 2of them], nor put it unto their soul.  

## Isaiah 43

1.  People Repopulated And now, thus says the lord  God, the one making you, O Jacob, and the one shaping you, O Israel, Do not fear! for I ransomed you, I called you  by your name, [3mine 2are 1you].

2. And if you should pass over through water, [2with 3you 1I am]; and rivers shall not engulf you. And if you go through fire, in no way should you be incinerated; a flame shall not incinerate you.

3. For I am the lord  your God, the holy one of Israel, the one delivering you. I made a barter for you -- Egypt, and Ethiopia, and Seba for you.

4. From which time [2valuable 1you were esteemed] before me, you were glorified, and I loved you. And I will give men for you, and rulers for  your head.

5. Do not fear, for [2with 3you 1I am]! From the east I will lead  your seed, and from the west I will bring you together.

6. I will say to the north, Bring! and to the south, Do not restrain! Bring  my sons from a land at a distance, and  my daughters from uttermost parts of the earth,

7. even all, as many as have been called upon to my name. For in  my glory I carefully prepared him, and I shaped him, and I made him.

8. And I brought out [2people 1a blind], and the eyes are likewise blind; and deaf ones [2the 3ears 1having].

9. All the nations were brought together, and [4shall be brought together 1rulers 2from 3them]. Who will announce these things? Or the things from the beginning, who will announce? Let them bring forth  their witnesses, and let them be justified, and let them hear, and let them speak truth!

10. Be witnesses to me! and I witness, says the lord  God, and  my servant whom I chose. That you should know, and should trust, and should perceive that I am. Before me [3did not 4exist 1another 2God], and after me it will not be.

11. I am God, and [3there is no 1besides 2me] one delivering.

12. I announced it, and I delivered. I berated, and there was not among you an alien god. You are to me witnesses, and I am the lord  God,

13. even from the beginning; and there is not one [2from  3my hands 1taking]. I will do, and who shall turn it?

14. Thus says the lord  God, the one ransoming you, the holy one  of Israel. Because of you I will send unto Babylon, and I will rouse [2the ones fleeing 1all], and the Chaldeans [2in 3boats 1shall be tied].

15. I am the lord  God,  your holy one, the one introducing for Israel your king.

16. For thus says the lord, the one making [2in 3the sea 1a way], and [2in 4water 3strong 1a path];

17. the one leading chariots and horse, and [2multitude 1a mighty]; but they were gone to sleep, and they shall not rise up; they were extinguished as a flax being extinguished.

18. Do not remember the first things, and the ancient things do not reckon together!

19. Behold, I do new things which now shall arise, and you all shall know them. And I will make [2in 3the 4wilderness 1a way], and [2in 3the 4waterless place 1rivers].

20. [5shall bless 6me 1The 2wild beasts 3of the 4field], sirens and daughters of ostriches; for I established [2in 3the 4wilderness 1water], and rivers in the waterless place, to give to drink to  [3race 1my  2chosen],

21. my people whom I procured; the ones [2my virtues 1to describe]. 

22.  I Am He Not now I called you, O Jacob, nor [2to tire 3you 1acted], O Israel.

23. You did not bring to me of your sheep, of the one of your whole offering; nor in  your sacrifices you glorified me. You were not enslaved in sacrifices, nor [3weary 1did 2you] with frankincense.

24. Nor you acquired for me a sacrifice of silver, nor the fat  of your sacrifices I desired. But in  your sins you stood in front of me, and in  your iniquities.

25. I am, I am he, the one wiping away  your lawless deeds because of me, and  your sins in no way shall I remember.

26. But you, remember! And let us plead together! You tell  of your lawless deeds first! that you should be justified.

27.  Your fathers first sinned, and  your rulers acted lawlessly against me.

28. And [3defiled 1the 2rulers]  my holy things; and I gave Jacob up to be destroyed, and Israel for scorning.  

## Isaiah 44

1.  The LORD Is One God But now hear! O Jacob  my child, and O Israel, whom I chose.

2. Thus says the lord  God, the one creating you, and shaping you from the belly. You shall still be helped. Do not fear! [2my servant 1O Jacob], and the one being loved, Israel whom I chose.

3. For I will give water for thirst to the ones going in a waterless place. I will place  my spirit upon  your seed, and  my blessings upon  your children.

4. And they shall rise up as [2in the midst 3of water 1grass], and as willows upon [2flowing by 1water].

5. This one shall say  I am of God. And this one shall call himself by the name of Jacob. And another shall inscribe with his hand,  I am of God. And [2by 3the 4name 5Israel 1he shall call himself].

6. Thus says  God, the king of Israel, and the one rescuing him -- the God of Hosts. I am first, and I am after these things; besides me there is no God.

7. Who is as I? Let him stand, and call, and announce, and prepare for me from which time I made man into the eon! And the things coming before  their coming to pass let them announce to you!

8. Do not cover up yourselves, nor wander! Have you not from the beginning given ear, and I reported it to you? [3witnesses 1You 2are] if there is a God besides me. 

9.  Vain Idols Profit Nothing And they were not hearkening then, the ones shaping and  carving all the vain idols, doing  their wishes which do not benefit them. But [2their own witnesses 1they are]. They shall not see, and they shall not know, that they should be ashamed -- he who shapes mighty and a carved molten casting for unprofitable things. Behold, all the ones partaking with him shall be ashamed --

10. the ones shaping a god, and all the ones carving unprofitable things.

11. And all from where they came from were dried up. Yes, [3the deaf-mutes 4of 5men 1let 6be brought together 2all], and let them stand together, and let them feel remorse, and let them be ashamed together!

12. For [2sharpens 1the fabricator] the iron tool. With a hammer he works it in coals, and with a drill he sets it. And he works it with the arm  of his strength. And he shall hunger and be weak, and in no way shall he drink water.

13. [2having chosen 1The fabricator] a piece of wood sets it with a measure, and forms it with a scraper. He made it with a carpenter's square, and with glue he composes it. And he made it as the appearance of a man, and as the beauty of man he sets it in a niche;

14. in which he fells [2for himself 1cedars], and he takes the holm oak and the oak; and he strengthened for himself the tree from the grove which the lord planted -- a pine; and the rain lengthened it,

15. that it might be for men to burn. And taking of it he warms himself, and in burning they bake bread loaves upon it; and with the remaining he works out gods, and does obeisance to them. He made it a carved idol, and he bends to them;

16. of which the half of it he incinerates in fire, and upon the half of it [2meat 1he ate] -- roasting he roasted a roast, and he was filled up. And heating himself he said, It is agreeable to me, for I was heated, and I beheld a fire.

17. And the rest he makes into [2god 1a carved]; he bends to it and does obeisance, and prays to it, saying, Deliver me, for [2my god 1your are]!

18. They do not know to think, for they were blurred  to see  with their eyes, and  to comprehend with their heart.

19. And he considered not  in his soul, nor knew  in intellect that the half of it he incinerated by fire, and baked [2upon  3its coals 1bread loaves], and [2roasting 3meat 1ate]; and the rest of it [2into 3an abomination 1he made]. And they do obeisance to it.

20. Know that [2is ashes  1their heart]! and they err, and no one is able to rescue  his soul. Behold! you shall not say that, Is there a lie in  my right hand?

21. Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel! for [3my servant 2are 1you]; I shaped you to be my servant. And you, O Israel, do not forget me!

22. Behold, I wiped away [2as 3a cloud  1your lawless deeds], and [2as 3dimness  1your sin]. Turn to me! and I shall ransom you.

23. Be glad, O heavens! for [4showed mercy 1the 2God  3of Israel]. Trump, O foundations of the earth! Yell out, O mountains in gladness, O hills, and all the trees  in them! for [2ransomed 1the lord]  Jacob, and Israel shall be glorified.

24. Thus says the lord, the one ransoming you, and the one shaping you from the belly, I am the lord, the one completing all things. I stretched out the heaven alone, and solidified the earth.

25. Who other shall efface the signs of the ones who deliver oracles, and divinations from the heart; to turn the intelligent ones unto the rear, and  their counsel being moronish;

26. and establishing the discourse of his servant, and [2the 3counsel  4of his messengers 1verifying]; the one saying  to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities  of Judea, You shall be built, and  her desolate places I shall raise up.

27. The one saying to the deep, You shall be made desolate, and  [2your rivers 1I will dry up].

28. The one telling Cyrus, Think, and all  my wants he will do; the one saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built, and  [3house  2of my holy 1I shall lay the foundation].  

## Isaiah 45

1.  Cyrus The LORD's Anointed Thus says the lord  God to my anointed Cyrus, whose [2I held  1right hand], [2to heed 3before 4him 1for nations]; and the strength of kings I will tear up; I will open [2before 3him 1doors], and gates shall not be closed up.

2. I [2before 3you 1will go], and [2mountains 1I shall level]. [2the doors 3of brass 1I shall break], and bars of iron I break in pieces.

3. And I shall give to you treasures -- obscure, concealed, unseen. I will open to you that you should know that I am the lord  your God, the one calling  your name, the God of Israel.

4. Because of  my servant Jacob, and Israel  my chosen, I shall call you by your name, and favorably receive you; though you did not know me.

5. For I am the lord  God, and there is not yet besides me -- there is not a god. I strengthened you, and you did not know me;

6. that [9should know 1the ones 2from 3the east 4sun 5and 6the ones 7from 8the west] that there is not one besides me. I am the lord  God, and there is not any more.

7. I am the one carefully preparing light, and I made darkness; the one making peace, and the one creating bad things. I am the lord  God, the one doing all these things.

8. Let [4be glad 1the 2heaven 3above], and [2the 3clouds 1let] sprinkle righteousness! Let [3arise 1the 2earth], and burst forth mercy! And let righteousness burst forth together! I am the lord, the one creating you.

9. What made better mortar of a potter? Will the one plowing plow the earth the entire  day? Will [3say 1the 2mortar] to the potter, What do you do that you do not work, nor have hands?

10. Woe the one saying to the father, Why shall you engender me? and to the mother, Why shall you travail?

11. For thus says the lord  God, the holy one of Israel, the one making the coming things, Ask me concerning  my sons. And concerning the works  of my hands, shall you give charge to me!

12. I made the earth, and man upon it. I [4by 5my hand 1solidified 2the 3heaven]. I [2to all 3the 4stars 1gave charge].

13. I raised him with righteousness as king, and all  his ways are straight. He shall build  my city, and the captivity  of my people he shall return. Not by ransoms, nor by gifts, said the lord of Hosts.

14. Thus says the lord of Hosts, Egypt tired for you, and the trade of the Ethiopians and the Sabeans, [2men 1haughty 4over 5you 3shall pass], and they will be your servants; and [2after 3you 1they shall follow] being tied in manacles, and they shall pass over to you, and shall do obeisance to you, and [2to 3you 1they shall pray], for [3among 4you  1God 2is], and there is no God besides you.

15. For you are God, and we did not know -- God  of Israel, the deliverer.

16. [5shall be ashamed 6and 7shall feel remorse 1all 2the ones 3being an adversary 4to him]; and they shall go in shame. Be dedicated to me, O islands.

17. Israel is delivered by the lord [2deliverance 1with an eternal]; they shall not be ashamed, nor should they feel remorse unto the eon still.

18. For thus says the lord, the one making the heaven, this  God, the one introducing the earth and making it; he separated it, [2not  5empty 1he did 3make 4it], but [3to dwell in 1he shaped 2it]; I am the lord, and there is none beside.

19. [2not 4in 5secret 1I have 3spoken], nor in a place of the earth that is dark. I did not tell to the seed of Jacob, [2a vain thing 1Seek]! I am the lord, the one speaking righteousness, and announcing truth. 

20.  False Gods Gather together and come! Consult together! O ones being delivered from the nations. They are not knowing, the ones lifting  [2wood 3carving 1their], and  praying to a god which does not deliver.

21. The ones that shall announce, let them approach that they should know together, who audibly did these things. From the beginning from then it was announced to you. Am I not the lord  God? There is no other besides me -- just and a deliverer. There is none besides me.

22. Turn unto me! and you shall be delivered, O ones from the end of the earth. I am  God, and there is no other.

23. According to myself I swear by an oath, that [2shall come forth 3from out of  4my mouth 1righteousness];  my words shall not be perverted. For [3shall bend to me 1every 2knee], and [3shall swear by an oath 1every 2tongue] by God,

24. saying, Righteousness and glory [2to 3him 1shall come]; and [6shall be ashamed 1all 2the ones 3of them being separated 4from 5the lord].

25. They shall be justified, and in  God they shall be glorified -- all the seed of the sons of Israel.  

## Isaiah 46

1.  The Idols are Fallen Bel fell, Dagon was broken. [2became  1Their carved images] for the wild beasts; and cattle lift them being bound for a load, tiring, fainting,

2. and hungering, not being able together; the ones who are not able to be delivered from war; but they themselves [2as captives 1are led away].

3. Hear me, O house  of Jacob, and all the rest  of Israel! O ones being lifted from the belly, and being corrected from childhood

4. until old age; I am, and until whenever you should become aged, I am. I endure you. I made, and I shall spare. I shall take up and I shall deliver you.

5. To whom do you liken me? Behold cunningly contrive, O misleading ones!

6. And the ones uniting in gold from a money bag, and silver in a yoke balance scale shall establish by weight; and ones hiring a goldsmith made handmade idols, and bowing they do obeisance to it.

7. They lift it upon the shoulder, and they go. And if they put it upon  its place, it remains. In no way shall it move, and who ever should yell to it, in no way shall it listen; [4from 5hurt 1in no way 2shall it deliver 3him]. 

8.  God's Counsel Will Stand Remember these things and moan! Change your mind, O ones being misled! Turn  in heart!

9. Remember the things prior from the eon! For I am  God, and there is no other besides me;

10. announcing formerly the last things before their taking place, and are completed. And I said, All  my counsel will stand, and all as much as I have planned I will do;

11. calling [2from 3the east 1the winged creature], and from a land at a distance, for the things which I have planned. And indeed I spoke, and indeed I led. I created and I did. I led him, and I prospered  his way.

12. Hear me, O ones destroying the heart! O ones far from  righteousness.

13. I brought near  my righteousness, in no way is it at a distance, and the deliverance the one by me, I will not be slow about; I have appointed in Zion deliverance to Israel for glory.  

## Isaiah 47

1.  The Shame of Babylon Go down, sit upon the ground, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground! There is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For no longer shall you be added to be called tender and delicate.

2. Take a millstone! Grind flour! Uncover  your face covering! Expose the gray hairs! Uncover the legs! Be passed over the rivers!

3. [2shall be uncovered  1Your shame]; [2shall be shone forth  1your scornings]; [2the 3just one 4from 5you 1I will take]; no longer shall I deliver up to men.

4. The one rescuing you -- the lord of Hosts is his name, the holy one of Israel.

5. Sit being vexed! Enter into the darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans! No longer should you be called, the strength of a kingdom.

6. I was provoked by  my people. You defiled  my inheritance. I gave them into  your hand, but you did not grant [2to them 1mercy]. [2the 3old man 1You oppressed] by the yoke exceedingly.

7. And you said, [3into 4the 5eon 1I will be 2ruling]. You comprehended not these things in  your heart, nor remembered the latter end.

8. But now hear these things! O delicate one, O one sitting down,  O one yielding. O one saying in  her heart, I am, and there is not another; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know bereavement. 

9.  Destruction of Babylon But now [2shall come 3upon 4you  1these two things] suddenly in [2day 1one]; childlessness and widowhood shall come suddenly upon you in  your sorcery, in the strength  of your enchantments -- exceedingly.

10. In the hope  of your wickedness, for you said, I am, and there is not another. Know that the understanding of these things and  your harlotry [3to you 1will be 2shame]! For you said in  your heart, I am, and there is not another.

11. And [2shall come 3upon 4you 1destruction]. And in no way shall you know a cesspool is there, and you shall fall into it. And [2shall come 3upon 4you 1misery], and in no way shall you be able [2clean 1to be]. And [2shall come 3upon 4you 5suddenly 1destruction], and in no way shall you know.

12. Stand now! with  your enchantments, and in the abundance of your sorcery! which you learned from your youth -- if you shall be able to derive benefit.

13. You are tired in  your counsels. Let [5stand 6indeed 7and 8deliver 9you 1the 2astrologers 3of the 4heaven]! [2the ones 3seeing 4the 5stars 1let] announce to you what is about to come upon you!

14. Behold, all are as sticks upon a fire, they shall be incinerated, and in no way shall they rescue  their soul from out of the flame. For you shall have coals of fire to sit by them;

15. these shall be your help. You tired in the revolt from  your youth. A man [2by 3himself 1wanders], but to you there will be no deliverance.  

## Isaiah 48

1.  Israel Is Hardened Hear these things, O house of Jacob! the ones being called by the name Israel, and [2from 3waters 4of Judah 1coming forth], the ones swearing by an oath to the name of the lord God of Israel, ones remembering not with truth, nor with righteousness,

2. and ones holding to the name of the [2city  1holy], and [2upon 3the 4God 5of Israel 1taking support]; the lord of Hosts is his name.

3. The former things again I announced, and from out of  my mouth it came forth, and audibly it happened. Suddenly I did, and it came about.

4. I know that you are hardened, and [2is a nerve 3of iron  1your neck], and  your forehead is as brass.

5. And I announced to you earlier what would happen before it came upon you. Audibly to you I did it, lest at some time or other you should say that,  My idols did. And you should say that, The carvings and the molten images gave charge to me!

6. You heard all, and you knew not. But even audibly [2to you 1I committed] the new things from the present which are about to take place, and you spoke not.

7. Now it takes place, and not earlier; and not in former days, and [3not 1you heard 2them]. Lest you should say, Yes, I know them.

8. Neither you knew, nor were knowing of, nor from the beginning when  your ears; for I knew that in disregarding you shall disregard, and [2lawless 3even 4from out of 5the belly 1you would be called].

9. Because of  my name I will show to you  my rage, and  [2my noble deeds 1I will bring] upon you, that I should not utterly destroy you. 

10.  The LORD Loves Israel Behold, I have bartered you, not for silver; and I rescued you from out of the furnace of poorness.

11. Because of myself I will do, for  my name is being profaned; and  my glory [3to another 1I will not 2give].

12. Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call! I am first, and I am into the eon.

13. And  my hand laid the foundation for the earth, and  my right hand solidified the heaven. I will call them, and they shall stand together.

14. And all shall be brought together, and they shall hear. Who announced to them these things? In loving you, I did  your will against Babylon, to lift away the seed of the Chaldeans.

15. I spoke, and I called. I brought him, and I prospered  his way.

16. Lead forward to me, and hear these things! [2not 4from 5the beginning 6in 7secret 1I have 3spoken]. When it took place, [2there 1I was]. And now the Lord, the lord, he sent me and  his spirit.

17. Thus says the lord, the one rescuing you, the holy one of Israel, I am the lord  your God. I have shown to you  how to find the way in which you shall go by it.

18. And if you hearkened to  my commandments, [2would have been 3as 4a river  1your peace], and  your righteousness as a wave of the sea;

19. and [2would have become 3even 4as 5sand  1your seed], and the progeny  of your belly as dust of the earth; nor now in any way shall you be utterly destroyed, nor shall [2be destroyed  1your name] before me.

20. Come forth from out of Babylon, O one fleeing from the Chaldeans! With a voice of gladness announce it, and audibly let this be made known! Report unto the end of the earth! Say! The lord rescued  his servant Jacob.

21. And if they should thirst, [3through 4the wilderness 1he will lead 2them]; [2water 3from 4the rock 1he shall bring forth] to them; [2shall be split 1the rock] and shall flow water, and [2shall drink  1my people].

22. There is no rejoicing, says the lord, to the impious.  

## Isaiah 49

1.  My Servant Hear, O islands! and take heed, O nations! Through [2time 1a long] it shall be established, says the lord. From out of the belly of my mother he called  my name.

2. And he made  my mouth as [2sword 1a sharp], and under the protection  of his hand he hid me. He made me as [2arrow 1a chosen]; and in  his quiver he hid me.

3. And he said to me, [2my servant 1You are], O Israel, and in you I shall be glorified.

4. And I said, Uselessly I tired in vain, and for nothing I gave  my strength. On account of this  my judgment is from the lord, and  my toil before  my God.

5. And now, thus says the lord, the one shaping me from out of the belly, [2servant 1to be his own],  to gather  Jacob to him, And Israel I shall have gathered, and I shall be glorified before the lord, and  my God will be my strength.

6. And he said, [2a great thing 3for you 1It is]  to be called my servant;  to establish the tribes of Jacob, and [2the 3dispersion  4of Israel 1to return]. Behold, I have given you for a covenant of a race, for a light of nations,  for you to be for deliverance unto the end of the earth.

7. Thus says the lord, the one rescuing you, the God of Israel, Sanctify the one treating [2as worthless  1his life], the one being abhorred by the nations of the servant of the rulers. Kings shall see him, and [2shall rise up 1rulers], and they shall do obeisance to him because of the lord; for [4is trustworthy 1the 2holy one 3of Israel], and I chose you.

8. Thus says the lord, [2time 1In the accepted] I heeded you, and in the day of deliverance I helped you, and I shaped you, and I gave you for a covenant of nations,  to establish the earth, and to inherit [2inheritances 1desolate].

9. Saying to the ones in bonds, Come forth! and to the ones in the darkness to be uncovered. In all the ways they shall be grazing, even in all the roads  of their pasture.

10. They shall not hunger nor thirst, nor shall [2strike 3them 1a burning wind], nor sun. But the one who shows mercy on them shall comfort them, and by springs of waters he shall lead them.

11. And I will establish every mountain for a way, and every road for a pasture to them.

12. Behold, these [2from a distance 1shall come]; these from north, and west, and others from out of the land of the Persians.

13. Be glad, O heavens, and exult, O earth! Break asunder, O mountains, with gladness! for [2showed mercy on  1God]  his people, and the humble  of his people he comforted. 

14.  The LORD will Not Forget Zion Zion said, [2abandoned 3me 1The lord], and,  [2Lord 3forgot 1My].

15. Shall [2forget 1a woman]  her child, or to not show mercy on on the progeny  of her belly? But even if [3these things 2might forget 1a woman],  I will not forget you, says the lord.

16. Behold, upon  my hands I portrayed your  walls; and [3before 4me 1you are 2always].

17. And quickly you shall be built by whom you were demolished; and the ones making you desolate shall go forth from out of you.

18. Lift up round about  your eyes, and perceive all! Behold, they were brought together, and they come to you. As I live, says the lord, that, [2them all 3as 4an ornament 1You shall clothe yourself with], and you shall put them on as an ornament of a bride.

19. For  your desolate places, and the places utterly destroyed, and the places having fallen down, that now they shall be confining because of the ones dwelling, and [3will be far 4from 5you 1the ones 2swallowing you down].

20. [5shall say 1For 6in  7your ears  2your sons 3whom 4you have lost], [3is too narrow 4for me 1The 2place], make for me a place that I shall dwell!

21. And you shall say in  your heart, Who engendered to me these? For I am childless and a widow, a sojourner and excluded. But these, who nourished for me? For I was left alone. But these [3to me 1from where 2were these]?

22. Thus says the Lord, the lord, Behold, I lift [2unto 3the 4nations  1my hand], and unto the islands I shall lift my agreed upon sign. And they shall lead  your sons in their bosom;  and [2your daughters 3upon 4their shoulders 1they shall lift].

23. And [2shall be 1kings] your wet-nurses;  and their ruling women your nurses. [3upon 4the face 5of the 6earth 1They shall do obeisance 2to you], and the dust  of your feet they shall lick. And you shall know that I am the lord, and [4shall not 5be ashamed 1the ones 2waiting 3for me].

24. Will anyone take [2from 3a giant 1spoils]? and if [2should be captured 1anyone] unjustly, shall he be delivered?

25. For thus says the lord, If any should capture a giant, he shall take the spoils. And the one taking from the one being strong, shall be delivered. But I  [2your case 1will plead], and I  [2your sons 1will rescue].

26. And [4shall eat 1the ones 2afflicting 3you]  their own flesh; and they shall drink [2as 4wine 3new  1their own blood], and shall be intoxicated. And [3shall perceive 1all 2flesh] that I am the lord, the one rescuing you, and assisting the strength of Jacob.  

## Isaiah 50

1.  The Sins of Israel Thus says the lord, Of what kind is this scroll of the certificate of divorce  of your mother, by which I sent her away? or to which debtor of the ones exacting me have I sold you to him? Behold,  for your sins you were sold; and  for your lawless deeds I sent away  your mother.

2. Why is it that I came, and there was no man? I called and there was none  hearkening. Is not [2strong  1my hand]  to rescue? or am I not able  to rescue? Behold,  by my rebuke I shall make quite desolate the sea, and I shall make rivers desolate places; and [2shall be dried up  1their fishes] from  there not being water; and they shall die for thirst.

3. I shall clothe the heaven with darkness, and [3as 4sackcloth 1I shall make  2its wrap-around garment].

4. The Lord, the lord gives to me a tongue of instruction  to know when it is necessary to speak a word. He stood me morning by morning. He added an ear for me to hear.

5. And the instruction of the lord opens my  ears, and I do not resist persuasion, nor do I dispute.

6.  My back I have given to whips,  and my jaws for slaps,  and my face I did not turn from the shame of ones spitting.

7. And the Lord, the lord [2a helper to me 1was]. On account of this I was not ashamed, but I set  my face as a solid rock; and I knew that in no way should I be ashamed.

8. For [4approaches 1the one 2justifying 3me]. Who is the one judging me? Let him oppose me at the same time! Yes, who is the one judging me? Let him approach to me!

9. Behold, the lord shall help me. Who shall inflict evil on me? Behold, [2all 1you 4as 5a cloak 3shall become old], and as a moth you shall be devoured.

10. Who among you is the one fearing the lord? let him obey the voice  of his servant! Let the ones going in darkness, and there is no light for them, yield upon the name of the lord, and support yourselves upon  God!

11. Behold, you all [2a fire 1kindle], and you strengthen the flame; you go to the light  of your fire, and the flame which you kindled. On account of me [2came to pass 1these things] to you; [2in 3distress 1you shall remain the night].  

## Isaiah 51

1.  The LORD Promises Deliverance and Justice Hearken to me! O ones pursuing the just thing, and seeking the lord. Look unto the solid rock! which you quarried, and into the pit of the well which you dug.

2. Look unto Abraham  your father! and unto Sarah the one travailing you. For he was one person, and I called him, and blessed him, and loved him, and multiplied him.

3. And [3you 1now 2I will comfort], O Zion. And I comforted all  her desolate places; and I will make  her desolate places as a park; and   her western places as a park of the lord. [2gladness 3and 4a leap for joy 1They shall find] in her -- acknowledgment and a voice of praise.

4. Hear me! Hear me O my people! and O kings [2to 3me 1give ear]! For a law [2from 3me 1shall go forth], and  my judgment for a light of nations.

5. [2approaches 3quickly  1My righteousness], and [2shall go forth 3as 4light  1my deliverance], and on  my arm they shall hope. [3for me 1Islands 2shall wait], and on  my arm they shall hope.

6. Lift up [2unto 3the 4heaven  1your eyes], and look unto the earth below! For the heaven is as smoke having been solidified. And the earth as a cloak shall be old, and the ones inhabiting [2as 3these 1shall die]. But the deliverance of mine [2into 3the 4eon 1shall be], and the righteousness of mine in no way shall fail.

7. Hear me, O ones knowing equity! a people of whom  my law is in  their heart. Do not fear the scorning of men, and  [2their disparagement 3not 1let] vanquish you!

8. For as a garment will be eaten upon time, and as wool shall be eaten by a moth; but the righteousness of mine [2into 3the 4eon 1will be]; and the deliverance of mine for generations of generations.

9. Awaken! Awaken! O Jerusalem, and put on the strength  of your arm! Awaken as in the beginning of days, as a generation of an eon! [2not 3you 1Are] her being quarried in width, being torn up by the dragon?

10. [3not 2you 1Are] her making desolate the sea, [3water 2of the deep 1the abundance], the one putting the depths of the sea for a way of a ford to the ones being rescued,

11. and the ones being ransomed? For by the lord they shall be returned, and shall come unto Zion with gladness, and [2leap for joy 1an everlasting]. [2upon 4head 1For 3their] praise and gladness shall overtake them. [6ran away 1Grief 2and 3distress 4and 5moaning]. 

12.  The LORD Promises Comfort I am, I am he, the one comforting you. Know who is being! that you should be fearful from [2man 1mortal], and from a son of man -- the ones who as grass were dried up.

13. And you forgot God, the one making you, the one making the heaven, and laying the foundation for the earth. And fear continually all the days  in front of the rage of the one afflicting you! in which manner he planned  to carry you away. And now where is the rage of the one afflicting you?

14. For in  your being delivered, he shall not stop nor pass time. And he shall not kill for hurt, and in no way shall he lack  his bread.

15. For I am  your God, the one disturbing the sea, and resounding  its waves. The lord of Hosts is my name.

16. I will put  my words into  your mouth. And under the shadow of my hand I will shelter you, in which I established the heaven, and founded the earth. And he shall say to Zion, [2my people 1You are].

17. Awaken! Awaken! Rise up, O Jerusalem! the one drinking from the hand of the lord the cup  of his rage. [2the 3cup 1For] of the blow, the drinking cup  of rage you drank and emptied out.

18. And there was no one  comforting you from all  your children whom you gave birth. And there was none  taking hold of  your hand, nor of all  your sons whom you raised.

19. Therefore these things are adverse to you. Who will grieve with you? A calamitous downfall, and defeat, hunger, and sword; who will comfort you?

20.  Your sons, the ones being perplexed, the ones sleeping upon the top of all the streets, as [2beet 1a half-boiled]; the ones full of the rage of the lord, fainting from the lord  God.

21. On account of this, hear! O one being humbled, and O one being intoxicated not from wine.

22. Thus says the lord  God, the one judging  his people, Behold, I took from out of  your hand the cup of the blow, the drinking cup  of my rage; and you shall not proceed to drink it any longer.

23. And I give it into the hand of the ones wronging you, and of the ones humbling you; the ones who said to your soul, Bow! that we should go by. And you put [3equal 4to the 5ground 1the things 2in your midst] outside to the ones coming near.  

## Isaiah 52

1.  The LORD Restores Jerusalem Awaken! Awaken, O Zion! Put on  your strength, O Zion! And you, put on  your glory, O Jerusalem, [3city 1the 2holy]! No longer shall there proceed to go through you uncircumcised and unclean.

2. Shake off the dust and rise up! Sit, O Jerusalem! Take off the bond  from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion!

3. For thus says the lord, [2without charge 1You were sold], and [2not 4with 5silver 1you shall 3be ransomed].

4. For thus says the Lord the lord. To Egypt [2went down  1My people]  formerly to sojourn there, and [2into 3Assyria 4by force 1they were led].

5. And now, why shall you be here? Thus says the lord, Because [2were taken  1my people] without charge, wonder and shriek! Thus says the lord, On account of you, [2always  1my name] is being blasphemed among the nations.

6. On account of this, [2shall know  1my people]  my name. On account of this in  that day, for I am he, the one speaking; I am at hand.

7. As an hour upon the mountains, as feet announcing good news, the hearing of peace, as of announcing good news -- good things; for audibly I will produce  your deliverance, saying, Zion, [2shall reign  1Your God].

8. The voice of the ones guarding you is exalted, and with the voice together they shall be glad. For eyes to eyes shall see when ever the lord should show mercy on  Zion. 

9.  The LORD Will Show Mercy Let [4break asunder 5with gladness 6together 1the 2desolate places 3of Jerusalem]! for the lord showed mercy on her, and rescued Jerusalem.

10. And the lord shall uncover  [2arm  1his holy] in the presence of all the nations. And [6shall see 1all 2the 3uttermost parts 4of the 5earth] the deliverance  by  our God.

11. Leave! Leave! Go forth from there, and the unclean thing do not touch! Go forth from out of the midst of it! Separate yourselves, O ones bearing the vessels of the lord!

12. For [2not 4with 5disturbance 1you shall 3come forth], nor [2in flight into exile 1shall you go forth]. [3shall go before 1For 4prior 5of you 2the lord]; and the one assembling you is the God of Israel.

13. Behold, [2shall perceive  1my servant], and he shall be exalted, and he shall be glorified, and he shall be raised up on high exceedingly.

14. In which manner [2shall be amazed 3by 4you 1many], so [4shall be despised 5by  6men 1the 2sight 3of your appearance], and  your glory by the sons of men.

15. Thus [3shall wonder 2nations 1many] over him; and [2shall hold 1kings]  their mouth. For to whom it was not announced concerning him, they shall see; and the ones who heard not shall perceive.  

## Isaiah 53

1.  The Sinless Lamb O lord, who trusted  our report? And the arm of the lord, to whom was it uncovered?

2. We announced as of a male child before him, as a root in a land thirsting. There is no appearance to him, nor glory; and we beheld him, and he does not have appearance nor beauty.

3. But  his appearance was without honor, and wanting by sons  of men. A man [2for 3calamity 1being], and knowing how to bear infirmity. For he turned  his face; he was dishonored and was not considered.

4. This one  [2our sins 1bore], and on account of us he was grieved. And we considered him to be for misery, and for calamity by God, and for ill treatment.

5. But he was wounded because of  our sins, and he was made infirm on account of  our lawless deeds. The discipline for our peace was upon him; by his stripe we were healed.

6. [2all 4as 5sheep 1We were 3wandered]. A man  [2in his way 1was wandered], and the lord delivered him up  for our sins.

7. And he on account of  being inflicted by evil opened not  his mouth. [2as 3a sheep 4unto 5slaughter 1He was led], and as a lamb before the one shearing is voiceless, so he did not open  his mouth.

8. In the humiliation, in his equity, he was lifted away.  [3his generation 1Who 2shall describe]? For [2was lifted away 3from 4the 5earth  1his life]. Because of the lawless deeds  of my people he was led unto death.

9. And I shall give the wicked for  his burial, and the rich for  his death. For [3lawlessness 1he did not 2commit], nor was treachery in  his mouth.

10. And the lord willed to cleanse him of the beating. If you should offer for a sin offering the thing for your life, he shall see [2seed 1a long-lived].

11. And the lord willed by his hand to remove misery  of his soul, to show to him light, and to shape in the understanding; to justify the just one, the good one serving many, and  [3their sins 1he 2shall bear].

12. On account of this he shall inherit many; and of the strong ones he will portion out spoils, because [2was delivered up 3unto 4death  1his soul]; and [2among 3the 4lawless ones 1he was considered]; and he himself [2the sins 3of many 1bore], and because of  their lawless deeds he was delivered up.  

## Isaiah 54

1.  The Inheritance of The LORD Be glad! O sterile, the one not giving birth. Break forth and yell! O one not travailing. For many are the children of the barren, rather than the one having the husband. For thus spoke the lord.

2. Widen the place  of your tent, and [2the 3hide coverings  4of your curtains 1pitch]! You should spare not. Distance out  your measured lands, and  [2tent pegs 1strengthen your]!

3. [2yet 3unto 4the 5right 6and 7the 8left 1Spread forth]! For  your seed [2nations 1shall inherit], and [2cities 3having been made desolate 1you shall dwell in].

4. You should not fear that you were disgraced, nor should you feel ashamed that you were berated. For [3shame 2everlasting 1you shall forget]; and the scorn  of your widowhood in no way shall you remember any longer.

5. For the lord, the one making you, the lord of Hosts is his name; and the one rescuing you, he is the God of Israel. [2God 3of all 4the 5earth 1He shall be called].

6. Not as [4woman 1a forsaken 2and 3faint-hearted] has [3called 4you 1the 2 lord]; nor as a woman [2from 3youth 1being detested], said  your God.

7. [2time 1A little] I left you behind; and with [2mercy 1great] I will show mercy on you.

8. In [2rage 1a little] I turned  my face from you; and in [2mercy 1eternal] I will show mercy on you, said the one rescuing you, the lord.

9. From the water  upon Noah, this is my plan, in so far as I swore by an oath to him in  that time to the earth, to not be enraged against you any longer; nor by your intimidation.

10. [2the 3mountains 1Shall] change over, nor  your hills be moved about; so not even  [2shown by 3me 4to you 1mercy] shall fail, nor the covenant  for your peace in any way shall change; [3spoke 1for 4kindness 5to you 2the lord].

11. Humble and confused, you were not comforted. Behold, I prepare for you carbuncle  for your stone, and for  your foundations sapphire.

12. And I will make the parapets jasper, and  your gates stones of crystal, and  your enclosure [2stones 1of choice];

13. and all  your sons instructed of God, and much peace to your children.

14. And [2in 3righteousness 1you shall be built] at a distance from the unjust. And you shall not be fearful, and trembling shall not approach to you.

15. Behold, converts shall come forward to you because of me, and they shall sojourn with you, and unto you they shall take refuge.

16. Behold, I created you, not as a brazier blowing in a fire of coals, and bringing forth a utensil for work; but I created you, not for destruction to corrupt.

17. Every weapon concocted against you shall not be prosperous; and every voice that shall rise up against you for judgment, all of them you shall vanquish. And the ones liable of you shall be in her; it is the inheritance to the ones attending the lord, and you shall be righteous to me, says the lord.  

## Isaiah 55

1.  Invitation to Life Woe the ones thirsting. Go unto water! And as many as do not have money, proceeding, buy and eat! And go and buy without money! even valuable wine and fatling.

2. What do you value for money not in bread loaves, and  your effort not unto fullness? Hearken to me! and you shall eat good things, and shall revel in good things to your soul.

3. Take heed with your ears, and follow after  my ways! Listen to me! and you shall live with good things  for your soul. And I shall ordain with you [2covenant 1an eternal] -- the sacred things of David, the trustworthy ones.

4. Behold, [3a testimony 4to nations 1I made 2him], a ruler and one assigning to nations.

5. Behold, nations which do not know you shall call upon you, and peoples which have no knowledge of you [2upon 3you 1shall take refuge], because of the lord  your God, even the holy one of Israel -- for he glorified you.

6. Seek the lord! and in the finding [2him 1call upon]! whenever he should approach to you.

7. Let [3leave 1the 2impious one]  his ways, and [2man 1the lawless]  his plans! And let him return unto the lord! and he shall be shown mercy, even from  our God, for [3unto 4much 1he will forgive  2your sins].

8. [5not 1For 4are  3plans 2my] as  your plans; nor as  your ways are my ways, says the lord.

9. But as the distance the heaven is from the earth, so [2is at a distance  1my way] from  your ways, and  your considerations from  my mind.

10. For as whenever [5should come down 1the 2rain 3or 4snow] from  heaven, and in no way shall it return until whenever it should saturate the earth, and the earth should bring forth, and should sprout, and should give seed to the one sowing, and bread for food;

11. so shall it be with my word, which ever shall come forth from out of  my mouth -- in no way shall it return to me empty until whenever it should finish as much as I wanted; and I will prosper  your ways and  my precepts.

12. For with gladness you shall go forth, and in joy you shall be led. For the mountains and the hills shall leap out favorably receiving you in joy, and all the trees of the field shall clap with their tender branches.

13. And instead of a pile, [2shall ascend 1the cypress]. And instead of the briar [2shall ascend 1the myrtle]. And the lord will be for a name and for [2sign 1an eternal], and it shall not cease.  

## Isaiah 56

1.  Deliverance to the Nations Thus says the lord, Guard equity, and do righteousness! [3is near 1for  2my deliverance] to come, and  my mercy to be uncovered.

2. Blessed is the man  doing these things, and the man  holding to them, and guarding  Sabbaths, so as to not profane them, and observing  his hands so as to not do unjustly.

3. [2not 1Let 5say 3the 4foreigner]! the one joining to the lord, saying, By separation [3will separate 4me 2surely 1The lord] from  his people. And [2not 1let 5say 3the 4eunuch] that, I am [2tree 1a dry]!

4. For thus says the lord to the eunuchs, As many as should keep  my Sabbaths, and should choose what I want, and should hold to  my covenant,

5. I will give to them in  my house, and in  my wall [2place 1a famous], better than sons and daughters. [4name 3an eternal 1I will give 2to them], and it shall not cease.

6. And I will give it to the foreigners  joining to the lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the lord,  to be to him for manservants and maidservants, and all the ones keeping  my Sabbaths, to not profane, and the ones holding to  my covenant.

7. I will bring them unto  [2mountain  1my holy], and I will gladden them in  [2house  3of prayer 1my].  Their whole-burnt offerings and  their sacrifices will be accepted upon  my altar.  For my house [2a house 3of prayer 1shall be called] for all the nations,

8. said the lord, the one gathering the ones having been dispersed of Israel. For I will gather unto him a congregation.

9. All  [2beasts  1wild], come! Let [6eat 1all 2the 3wild beasts 4of the 5forest]!

10. See how they all have been blinded! they knew not. All [2dogs 1are dumb], they shall not be able to bark; ones dreaming of a bed, being fond of slumber.

11. Yes, the [2dogs 1impudent 6in the 7soul 3not 4knowing 5fullness]; and they are wicked, not knowing understanding; all  [2their own ways 1followed after]; each according to  his own advantage from his uttermost, saying,

12. Come we should take wine and be drunk with wine to intoxication, and [2shall be 3such as this 4day 1tomorrow] -- great, rather exceedingly.  

## Isaiah 57

1.  The Idolatry of Israel Behold! how the just one perishes, and no one looks out for the heart; and [2men 1just] are lifted away, and no one contemplates. For from the face of injustice [3has been lifted away 1the 2just one].

2. [2will be 3in 4peace  1His burial], he has been lifted from out of the midst.

3. But you lead forward here, [2sons 1O lawless], seed of adulterers, and of a harlot!

4. In what have you reveled in? And against whom have you opened  your mouth? And against whom have you slackened  your tongue? [2not 1Are you] children of destruction? a seed without honor?

5. ones calling for aid upon the idols under [2trees 1bushy]? slaying  their children in the ravines between the rocks?

6. That is your  portion, this is your  lot. To those you poured out libations, and to these you offered sacrifices; over these things then shall I not be provoked to anger?

7. Upon [4mountain 1the high 2and 3elevated], there is your  bed, and there you hauled to sacrifice your sacrifices.

8. And behind the doorposts  of your door you placed your memorials. Did you think that if you should separate from me [3more 2anything 1you would have]. You loved the ones going to bed with you;

9. and you multiplied  your harlotry with them, and [2many 1you made] of them far from you. And you sent ambassadors over  your borders, and you were abased unto Hades.

10. [2in 3your many ways 1You tired]. and You said not, I shall cease growing in strength. For you practiced these things. On account of this [2did not 3earnestly beseech 4of me 1you].

11. In venerating whom were you afraid of, that you lied against me, and did not remember me, nor took me into  your consideration, nor into  your heart? And I beholding you will overlook, yet [3me 1you did not 2fear].

12. And I will report  of your righteousness; and  your evils shall not benefit you.

13. Whenever you should yell out, then let them rescue you in  your affliction! [3these things 1For 2all] the wind shall take, and [2shall carry away 1the gale]. But the ones holding on in me shall acquire the earth, and they shall inherit  [2mountain  1my holy].

14. And they shall say, Clear [2from 3in front 4of him 1the ways], and lift the impediments from the way  of my people!

15. Thus says the highest, the one in the highest, dwelling the eon. Holy in the holies; the name to him -- the lord; [2highest 3in 4the holies 1the one resting]; and to the faint-hearted giving long-suffering, and giving life to the ones being broken  in heart.

16. [2not 5into 6the 7eon 1I shall 3punish 4you], nor [3always 1shall I be provoked to anger 2with you]; for a spirit from me shall go forth, and [4breath 3all 1I 2made].

17. On account of sin a little in anything I grieved him, and I struck him, and I turned  my face from him; and I was grieved, and he went gloomy in  his ways.

18.  [2his ways 1I have seen], and I healed him, and comforted him, and gave to him [2comfort 1true].

19. Peace upon peace to the ones far off, and to the ones being near. And the lord said, I will heal them.

20. But the unjust thus shall swell as waves, and [3to rest 1will not 2be able].

21. There is no rejoicing to the impious, said  God.  

## Isaiah 58

1.  The LORD's Chosen Fast Yell out in strength! and you should not spare. As a trumpet, raise up high  your voice, and announce to my people  their sins, and to the house of Jacob  their lawless deeds!

2. [2me 3day 4by 5day 1They seek], and [2to know 3my  4ways 1they desire], as a people [2righteousness 1executing], and [3judgment 4of their God 1not 2abandoning]. They ask me now [2judgment 1for a just], and [2to approach 3to God 1they desire],

3. saying, Why is it that we fasted, and you did not look? Why did we humble  our souls, and you did not know? For in the days  of your fasts you find the things of your wants, and all the ones under your hands you goad.

4. [2for 3litigations 4and 5fights 1You fast], and you beat [2with your fists 1the humble]. Why [2to me 1do you fast] as you do today? [2to be heard 3in 4a cry  1is it for your voice]?

5. [2not 4this  5fast 1I did 3choose], nor a day [2to humble 1for a man]  his soul; nor even should you bend [2as 3a hook  1your neck], nor [2sackcloth 3and 4ashes 1should you spread under you], nor thus shall you call [2fast 1an acceptable].

6. [3not 5such 2I 1Did 4choose] a fast, says the lord. But untie every bond of injustice! Part [2perverseness 1violent] of exchanges! Send out [3the ones having been devastated 1by 2a free release], and [2every 4writ 3unjust 1tear apart]!

7. Break [2with ones hungering  1your bread], and [3poor 2the homeless 1bring] into  your house! If you behold one naked, clothe him! And concerning the members of your family  of your seed, you shall not disdain them.

8. Then [2shall be torn through 3the 4morning  1your light], and the things for your cures quickly shall arise; and [2shall go before 3in front of 4you  1your righteousness], and the glory  of God shall screen you.

9. Then you shall yell, and the lord shall hearken to you. Yet while you are speaking he shall say, Behold, I am at hand. If you remove from yourself conspiracy, and stretching forth of the hands, and [2discourse 1grumbling];

10. and should give to ones hungering the bread from your soul, and [2the soul 3being humble 1should fill up], then [2shall rise 3in 4the 5darkness  1your light], and  your darkness shall be as midday.

11. And [2will be  1your God] with you always, and you shall be filled up just as [2desires  1your soul]. And  your bones shall be fattened, and will be as [2garden 1a saturated], and as a spring which [2failed not 1water].

12. And [4shall be built 5to you 1the 3desolate places 2everlasting], and [4will be  3foundations 1your 2everlasting] in generations of generations; and you shall be called a builder of barriers. And the stones, the ones between  your roads shall cease.

13. If you should turn  your foot from the Sabbaths,  so as to not do  your wants on the [2day  1holy], and shall call the Sabbaths delightful, holy to your God; if you shall not lift  your foot to work, nor shall you speak a word in anger from out of  your mouth,

14. then shall you be relying upon the lord, and he will bring [3upon your 1the 2good things]  land, and he will feed you the inheritance of Jacob  your father. For the mouth  of the lord spoke these things.  

## Isaiah 59

1.  The Sin of a Nation Is not [4strong 1the 2hand 3of the lord]  to deliver? or [2weighed down  1his ear] to not listen?

2. But  your sins make a part between you and  God; and on account of  your sins he turned  his face from you,  to not show mercy.

3.  For your hands are tainted with blood, and  your fingers with sins;  and your lips spoke lawlessness, and  your tongue [2injustice 1meditated upon].

4. No one speaks just things, nor is there [2equity 1true]. They rely upon vanities, and they speak empty things; for they sire misery and give birth to lawlessness.

5. [2eggs 3of asps 1They hatch], and [3a web 2of a spider 1weave]. And the one about  [2their eggs 1to eat], breaking a rotten egg found also in it a cobra.

6.  Their web shall not be made into a garment, nor shall they clothe themselves from  their works,  for their works are works of lawlessness.

7.  And their feet [2unto 3wickedness 1run], quick to pour out blood, and  their thoughts are thoughts of murder. Destruction and misery are in  their ways.

8. And the way of peace they do not know, and there is no equity in  their ways.  For their roads [3are perverted 1which 2they travel through], and they do not know peace.

9. On account of this [2left  1equity] from them, and in no way shall [2overtake 3them 1righteousness]. In their waiting light, [2came 3to them 1darkness]; waiting for daylight, [2in 3midnight 1they walked].

10. They shall grope as blind men for a wall, and [2as 3ones not 4possessing 5eyes 1they shall grope]. They shall fall in midday as at midnight; [2as 3ones dying 1they shall moan].

11. As a bear and as a dove together they shall go. We awaited judgment, and there is no deliverance; [2far 1it is removed] from us.

12. [4is great 1For 2our  3lawlessness] before you, and  our sins withstood us.  For our lawless deeds are in us, and  our offences we knew.

13. We were impious, and lied, and departed from  our God. We spoke unjustly, and we resisted persuasion. We sired, and meditated [3from 4our heart 2words 1unjust].

14. And we left behind  equity, and  righteousness [2far off 1removed]. For [3was consumed 4in  5their ways 1the 2truth], and [3by 4a straight way 1they were not able 2to go].

15. And the truth was lifted away, and they changed  their thought of the perceiving. And the lord beheld, and it did not please him, for there was no equity. 

16.  The Defender And he beheld, and there was no man. And he contemplated, and there was no one  assisting. And he defended them with his arm, and  [2with his charity 1he supported them].

17. And he clothed himself with righteousness as a chest plate; and he put a helmet of deliverance upon his head. and he put around himself a cloak of vengeance -- even  a wrap-around garment,

18. as one recompensing a reward of scorn to the adversaries.

19. And [4shall fear 1the ones 2from 3the west] the name of the lord; and the ones from the east sun shall fear the [2name  1honorable]. [6shall come 1For 7as 9river 8a violent 2the 3anger 4of 5the lord]; it shall come with rage.

20. And [3shall come 4from 5Zion 1the one 2rescuing], and he shall turn impiety from Jacob.

21. And this [2to them  3is by me 1covenant], said the lord. The spirit --  mine, which is upon you, and  my words which I put in  your mouth, in no way shall fail from  your mouth, nor from out of the mouth  of your seed; said the lord, from the present and unto the eon.  

## Isaiah 60

1.  The Glory of The LORD upon Jerusalem Be enlightened! Be enlightened, O Jerusalem! [4is come 1for 2your  3light], and the glory of the lord [2upon 3you 1has risen].

2. Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and a dimness upon nations; [4upon 1but 5you 3shall appear 2the lord], and  his glory [2upon 3you 1shall be seen].

3. And [2shall go 1nations] by your light, and kings in your brightness.

4. Lift [2round about  1your eyes], and behold [3gathering together 1all  2your children]! [3come 1All  2your sons] from far off, and  your daughters [2upon 3shoulders 1shall be carried].

5. Then you shall see, and shall be fearful, and shall be startled in the heart; for [3shall turn 4unto 5you 1the riches 2of the sea], and of nations, and of peoples; and they shall come to you.

6. Herds of camels, and [5shall cover 6you 1camels 2of Midian 3and 4Ephah]; [2all 4from out of 5Sheba 1they 3come] bringing gold and frankincense; and [2the 3deliverance 4of the lord 1they shall announce as good news].

7. And all the sheep of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, and rams of Nebaioth shall come to you; and [2shall be offered 1acceptable sacrifices] upon  my altar, and the house  of my prayer shall be glorified.

8. Who thus as clouds fly, even as doves with young?

9. [3for me 1Islands 2waited], and boats of Tarshish are among the first to lead  your children from far off, and  [2silver 3and  4gold 1their] is with them, on account of the [2name 3of the lord  1holy], and on account of the holy one  of Israel to be glorious.

10. And [2shall build 1foreigners]  your walls, and  their kings shall stand beside you. For on account of my anger I struck you, and on account of mercy I loved you.

11. And [2shall be open  1your gates] continually; day and night they shall not be locked; to bring in to you the force of nations, and their kings leading.

12. For the nations and the kings which will not serve to you shall perish; and the nations [3unto desolation 1shall be made desolate].

13. And the glory  of Lebanon [2to 3you 1shall come] with cypress and pine and cedar together, to glorify  [2place  1my holy]. And the place of their feet I will glorify.

14. And they shall go to you being in awe -- sons of the ones humbling you. And [5shall do obeisance at 6the 7soles  8of your feet 1all 2the ones who 3provoked 4you]. And you shall be called, City of the lord, Zion of Holy Israel.

15. Because  you became abandoned and detested, and there was no one helping, even I will make you [2leap for joy 1an everlasting], a gladness to generations of generations.

16. And you shall nurse milk of nations, and [2wealth 3of kings 1you shall eat]. And you shall know that I am the lord, the one delivering you, and rescuing you -- the God of Jacob.

17. And instead of brass, I shall bring to you gold; and instead of iron, I shall bring to you silver; and instead of wood, I shall bring to you brass; and instead of stones -- iron; and I shall appoint  your rulers for peace, and  your overseers for righteousness.

18. And [2shall not 4be heard 3any longer 1injustice] in  your land, nor destruction, nor misery within  your borders. And [2shall be called 3Deliverance  1your walls], and  your gates, Carving.

19. And [3will not be 4to you 5any longer 1the 2sun] for the light of day, nor the rising moon shall give light to you  at night. But [2will be 3to you 1the lord 5light 4an eternal], even the God of your glory.

20. [4shall not 1For 5go down 2the 3sun] to you, and the moon [3to you 1shall not 2subside]. [3will be 1For 4to you 2the lord 6light 5an eternal]. And [4shall be fulfilled 1the 2days  3of your mourning].

21. And  your people are all righteous, and [4through 5the eon 1they shall inherit 2the 3earth], keeping the thing planted, even the works of their hands for glory.

22. The very few will be for thousands, and the least for [2nation 1a great]. I the lord in due time shall gather them.  

## Isaiah 61

1.  The Anointed One Spirit of the lord is upon me,  because he anointed me to announce good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the ones being broken in the heart; to proclaim [2to captives 1a release], and [2to the blind 1recovery of sight];

2. to call [2year 3of the lord 1the acceptable], and day of recompense; to comfort all the ones mourning;

3. to give to the ones mourning for Zion glory instead of ashes; an anointing of gladness to them that mourn; according to an apparel of glory instead of a spirit of indifference. And they shall be called generations of righteousness, a thing planted of the lord for glory.

4. And they shall build up [2wildernesses 1everlasting] being made quite desolate prior. They shall rise up and shall revive cities of wildernesses having been made quite desolate for generations.

5. And [2shall come 1foreigners] tending  your sheep, and Philistines as plowmen and vine dressers.

6. And you [2priests 3of the lord 1shall be called]. Ministers of our God -- it shall be said to you. [2strength 3of nations 1You shall devour], and in  their riches you shall be admired.

7. Thus of a second time they shall inherit the land, and [2gladness 1everlasting] is above their head.

8. For I am the lord, the one loving righteousness, and detesting seizures by injustice. And I will give  their effort to the just ones, and [3covenant 2an eternal 1I shall ordain] with them.

9. And [2shall be known 3among 4the 5nations  1their seed], and  their progeny in the midst of the peoples. All seeing them will recognize them, for these are a seed being blessed by God.

10. And in gladness they shall be glad over the lord. Let [2exult  1my soul] over the lord! For he clothed me with a cloak of deliverance, and an inner garment of gladness. As a groom, he put on me a mitre; and as a bride, he adorned me with an ornament.

11. And as the earth growing  its flower, and as a garden  [2its seeds 1sprouts forth], so [3will raise up 1the Lord 2the lord] righteousness and a leap for joy before all the nations.  

## Isaiah 62

1.  The LORD Appoints a New Name On account of Zion I will not keep silent; and on account of Jerusalem I will not spare, until whenever [2comes forth 3as 4light  1my righteousness],  and my deliverance [2as 3a lamp 1shall be burned].

2. And [2shall see 1nations]  your righteousness, and all kings  your glory. And he shall call you  [3name 1by your  2new] which the mouth of the lord shall name it.

3. And you will be a crown of beauty in the hand of the lord, and a diadem of the kingdom in the hand of your God.

4. And no longer shall you be called -- One Being Forsaken. And  your land shall not be called -- Desolation. For you shall be called -- My will; and  your land -- Being Lived In. For the lord took pleasure in you, and  your land shall be lived in together.

5. And as [2living with 1a young man] a virgin, so shall [2dwell  1your sons] with you. And it will be in which manner [2shall be glad 1a groom] over a bride, so the lord will be glad over you.

6. And upon  your walls, O Jerusalem, I placed keepers for the entire  day and the entire  night; ones who through the end shall not keep silent making mention of the lord.

7. [3not 2there is 1For 5to you 4one likened], whenever he should set things right, and should make Jerusalem prancing upon the earth.

8. [2swore by an oath 1The lord] according to  his right hand, and according to the strength  of his arm, I shall not give  your grain, and  your foods to your enemies; and neither shall [3drink 2sons 1alien]  your wine, for which you troubled to make.

9. But the ones gathering shall eat them, and they shall praise the lord; and the ones gathering shall drink them in  [3properties  2holy 1my].

10. Go through  my gates, and open a way for my people! And the stones of the ones from the way scatter away! Lift the agreed upon sign unto the nations!

11. For behold, the lord made it audible unto the end of the earth. Say to the daughter of Zion! Behold, the deliverer [2to you 1is come], having  his own wage with him, and  his work before his face.

12. And he shall call them, [2People 1Holy] being ransomed by the lord. But you shall be called [2Being Anxiously Sought After 1A City], and not Being Abandoned.  

## Isaiah 63

1.  A Day of Recompense and Ransoming Who is this, the one coming from out of Edom, with [2dyed red 1garments] from out of Bozrah? This one beautiful in his apparel, [3force 1with 2a mighty]? I reason righteousness and the case of deliverance.

2. Why are your [2red  1clothes], and  your garments as from a trampled wine vat,

3. full of that being trampled? And of the nations there is not a man with me. And I trampled them in my rage, and I broke them in pieces as ground, and led  their blood unto the ground. And all  my garments are defiled.

4. For a day of recompense came upon them, and a year of ransoming is at hand.

5. And I looked, and there was no helper. And I paid attention, and no one assisted. And [3rescued 4them  2arm 1my], and  my rage attended to it.

6. And I trampled them in my anger, and I led down  their blood unto the ground.

7. [2the 3mercy 4of the lord 1I remembered]; the virtues of the lord in all which he recompenses to us. The lord -- [2judge 1a good] to the house of Israel; he brings upon us according to  his mercy, and according to the magnitude  of his righteousness.

8. And he said,  [4my people 1Children 2in no way 3will disrespect]. And he became to them for deliverance,

9. from out of all their affliction. Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but he, the lord delivered them, because of  loving them. And he spared them -- he ransomed them, and he took them, and raised them all the days of the eon.

10. But they resisted persuasion, and provoked  [2spirit  1his holy]. And [2turned 3against them 1the lord] for enmity; he waged war against them.

11. And he remembered [2days 1everlasting]; the bringing up from the land the shepherd of the sheep. Where is the one putting [4in 5them 1the 3spirit  2holy]?

12. the one leading [2by the 3right hand 1Moses], the one being the arm  of his glory? He prevailed over water in front of him; he made for himself [2name 1an everlasting].

13. He led them through the deep as a horse through a wilderness, and they tired not.

14. And as cattle led through a plain, [4descended 1spirit 2of 3the lord], and guided them. Thus you led  your people to make for yourself [2name 1a glorious].

15. Turn from  heaven, and look from  [2house  1your holy], and from your glory! Where is  your zeal and  your strength? Where is the abundance  of your mercy and your compassions, that you withheld from us?

16. For you are our father. For Abraham did not know us, and Israel did not recognize us. But you, O lord our father, rescue us! From the beginning  your name [2upon 3us 1is].

17. Why did you wander us, O lord, from  your way? You hardened  our hearts  to not fear you? Return on account of  your servants! on account of the tribes  of your inheritance.

18. that [2a little 1we should inherit  4mountain  3of your holy].  Our adversaries trampled  your sanctuary.

19. We became as  from the beginning when you did not rule us, nor was [2called  1your name] upon us.  

## Isaiah 64

1.  Israel Acknowledges Its Sin If you should open the heaven, [2trembling 3will take hold 4from 5you 1mountains], and they shall melt away;

2. as beeswax from fire shall melt away. And [2shall incinerate 1fire] the adversaries, and [3for distinction 2will be  1your name] among the adversaries. From in front of you nations shall be disturbed.

3. Whenever you should do the honorable things trembling shall take hold of mountains.

4. From the eon we heard not, nor  our eyes beheld a God besides you, and  your works which you shall do to the ones waiting for mercy.

5. For he shall meet with the ones doing  justice, and  your ways shall be remembered. Behold, you have been provoked to anger, and we sinned; on account of this we were wandered.

6. And [3became 4as 5unclean 2all 1we]. [3is as 4a menstrual rag 5sitting apart 1All  2our righteousness]. And we flowed away as leaves on account of  our lawless deeds; thus the wind shall bear us away.

7. And there is no one  calling upon  your name, nor  one remembering to take hold of you. For you turned  your face from us, and you delivered us up because of  our sins.

8. And now, O lord, [2our father 1you are]; and we are mortar, [3works  4of your hands 2are all 1we].

9. You should not be provoked to anger with us very much, and [2should not 4for 5a long time 3be remembered 1our sins]. And now, look upon us, O lord, for [3your people 2all 1we are]!

10. The city  of your holiness became desolate. Zion [2as 3desolate 1became]. Jerusalem for a curse.

11. The house  our holy place, and the glory which [2blessed  1our fathers], became scorched, and all  our honorable things are cast down.

12. And over all these things you endured, O lord, and kept silent, and humbled us very much.  

## Isaiah 65

1.  Judgment and Deliverance [2apparent 1I became] to the ones [3for me 1not 2seeking]. I was found by the ones [3for me 1not 2asking]. I said, Behold, I am -- to the nation, the ones who did not call of me by name.

2. I spread forth  my hands the entire  day to a people resisting persuasion and speaking contrary; the ones not having gone [2way 1the good], but after  their sins.

3.  This people, the one provoking me, [2before 3me 1is always]. They sacrifice in the gardens, and they burn incense upon the bricks to the demons which are not.

4. And in the tombs in the caves they sleep for the sake of dreams; the ones eating meat of a pig, and the broth of sacrifices. [3are tainted 1All  2their vessels].

5. The ones saying, Be at a distance from me, you should not approach me, for I am clean. This is the smoke  of my rage; a fire burns with it all the days.

6. Behold, it is written in my presence, I shall not keep silent until whenever I recompense. And I will recompense unto  their bosom

7.  their sins, and the ones of their fathers, says the lord, the ones that burnt incense upon the mountains, and [3upon 4the 5hills 1berated 2me]. I will recompense  their works into  their bosom.

8. Thus says the lord, In which manner [3shall be found 1the 2grape-stone] in the cluster of grapes, and they shall say, You should not lay it waste, for there is a blessing in it; so I will do because of the ones serving me -- [2this one 1because of] in no way shall I destroy all.

9. And I shall lead out the one of [2of Jacob 1the seed], and the one of Judah. And he shall inherit  [3mountain  2holy 1my], and [4shall inherit it  1my chosen 2and  3my servants], and they shall dwell there.

10. And there shall be in the grove folds of flocks; and the ravine of Achor shall be for a resting place of herds for my people, the ones who sought me.

11. But you are the ones having abandoned me, and having forgotten  [2mountain  1my holy], and are preparing [2to the 3demon 1a table], and filling  [2to good luck 1a mixture].

12. I will deliver you unto the sword. [2all 4by 5slaughter 1You shall 3fall], for I called you and you hearkened not; I spoke, and you disregarded, and you did the wicked thing before me, and what I did not want you chose.

13. On account of this, Thus says the lord, Behold, the ones serving to me shall eat, but you shall hunger. Behold,  my servants shall drink, but you shall thirst. Behold, the ones serving me shall be glad, but you shall be ashamed.

14. Behold, the ones serving me shall exult in gladness, but you shall cry out because of the misery  of your heart; and from the destruction of your spirit you shall shriek.

15. For you shall leave behind  your name for a glut to my chosen, [4you 1and 3shall do away with 2the lord]. But to the ones that serve to me, they shall be called [2name 1by a new],

16. which shall be blessed upon the earth. For they shall bless the [2God  1true]. And the ones swearing by an oath upon the earth shall swear by an oath on the [2God  1true]. For they shall forget  [3affliction 1their  2first], and it shall not ascend unto  their heart. 

17.  A New Heaven and Earth For there will be the [2heaven 1new], and the [2earth 1new]. And in no way shall they remember the former things, nor in any way shall it come upon  their heart.

18. But [4gladness 5and 6a leap for joy 1they shall find 2in 3her]. For behold, I make Jerusalem a leap for joy, and over  my people for gladness.

19. And I shall exult over Jerusalem, and shall be glad over  my people. And no longer shall there be heard in her a voice of weeping, nor a voice of crying;

20. nor in any way shall there be yet an untimely miscarriage, nor an old man who shall not fill up  his time. [4will be 1For 2the 3young man] a hundred years old, and the [4dying 1sinner 5at a hundred 6years old  3accursed 2will be].

21. And they shall build residences, and they shall dwell in them. And they shall plant vineyards, and they shall eat  their produce, and [2the 3wine 1shall drink].

22. In no way shall they build and another dwell therein. And in no way shall they plant and another eat of it. For according to the days of the [2of a tree  1life] will be the days  of my people, for the works  of their hands shall grow old.

23.  And my chosen shall not tire in empty things, nor shall they produce children for a curse; for [2a seed 3being blessed 4by 5God 1it is], and  their progeny with them.

24. And it will be before  their crying out, I will hearken unto them; yet during their speaking I will say, What is it?

25. Then wolves and lambs shall graze together; and the lion [3as 4an ox 1shall eat 2straw]; and the serpent shall eat of the earth as bread; they shall not do wrong nor lay waste upon  [2mountain  1my holy], says the lord.  

## Isaiah 66

1.  Judgment and Hope Thus says the lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool  for my feet. What kind of house shall you build to me? and what kind of place  for my rest?

2. For all these things I made  by my hand, and [3are 4mine 1all 2these], says the lord. And upon whom shall I look upon, but only upon the humble and unassuming, and the one trembling at  my words?

3. But the lawless one, the one sacrificing a calf to me is as the one striking a man; and the one sacrificing of the flock is as the one killing a dog; and the one offering fine flour is as the one offering the blood of a pig; the one offering frankincense for a memorial is as blasphemous. And they chose  their ways, and  their abominations which  their soul wanted.

4. And I will choose  their mockeries, and  [2their sins 1I will recompense] against them. For I called them, and they did not hearken to me; I spoke and they heard not; and they acted  wickedly before me, and [2that which 3I did not 4want 1chose].

5. Hear the word of the lord! O ones trembling at  his word. Let [2speak 1your brethren] to the ones detesting you, and abhorring you, that the name of the lord should be glorified, and should be seen in  their gladness, but those shall be ashamed.

6. A voice of a cry from out of the city; a voice from out of the temple; the voice of the lord recompensing a recompense to the adversaries.

7. Before  her travailing to give birth, before the coming of the misery of the pangs, she fled and gave birth to a male.

8. Who heard such? and who has seen thus? Has [2travailed 1the earth] in one day? or even [2given birth 1a nation] at once, that [2travailed 3and 4gave birth to 1Zion]  her children?

9. But I gave  this expectation, and you did not remember me, said the lord. And behold, I [2the one bearing 3and 4the one sterile 1made], said  your God.

10. Be glad, O Jerusalem, and let [5assemble for a festival 6in 7her 1all 2the ones 3loving 4her]! And the ones dwelling her rejoice in joy, all as many as mourn for her!

11. that you should nurse and be filled up from the breast of her comfort; that sucking out you should indulge at the introduction of her glory.

12. For thus says the lord, Behold, I turn aside to them as a river of peace, and as a rushing stream inundating the glory of the nations.  Their children [2upon 3shoulders 1shall be carried], and [2upon 3knees 1shall be comforted].

13. As if any mother shall comfort, so also I shall comfort you; and in Jerusalem you shall be comforted.

14. And you shall see, and [2shall rejoice  1your heart], and  your bones [2as 3pasturage 1shall rise up]; and [4shall be known 1the 2hand 3of the lord] to the ones fearing him, and he shall threaten the ones resisting persuasion.

15. For behold the lord [2as 3a fire 1shall come], even as a blast by his chariots, to recompense [2in 3rage 1punishment], and being contemptuously rejected in a flame of fire.

16. For by the fire of the lord [4shall be judged 1all 2the 3earth], and by  his broadsword all flesh. Many shall be slain by the lord.

17. The ones purifying themselves and cleansing themselves in the gardens, and [10in 11the 12thresholds 1the ones eating 2the meat 3of a pig 4and 5the 6abominations 7and 8the 9mouse], together shall be consumed, said the lord.

18. And I  [2their works 3and  4their device 1know]. And I come to bring together all the nations, and the tongues. And they shall come and shall see  my glory.

19. And I will leave upon them a sign. And I will send out from them ones having been delivered unto the nations -- unto Tarshish, and Pul, and Lud, and Meshach, and Tubal, and unto  Greece, and unto the islands -- the ones at a distance, the ones who have not heard of my  name, nor have seen  my glory. And they shall announce  my glory among the nations.

20. And they shall lead  your brethren from out of all the nations, as a gift to the lord, with horses, and chariots, in royal chariots drawn by mules with awnings, into the holy city Jerusalem. And the lord said, As  [4may offer 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  their sacrifices to me with psalms in the house of the lord,

21. that from them I will take priests and Levites, said the lord.

22. [2in which 3manner 1For] the [2heaven 1new] and the [2earth 1new] which I make wait before me, says the lord, so I shall establish  your seed, and  your name.

23. And it will be month by month, and Sabbath by Sabbath, [3shall come 1all 2flesh]  to do obeisance before me in Jerusalem, said the lord.

24. And they shall go forth, and shall see the carcasses  of men, the ones violating against me.  For their worm shall not come to an end, and  their fire shall not be extinguished. And they will be for a sight to all flesh.
