14. and there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy, and he should be jealous  of his wife, and she be defiled; or there should come upon him a spirit of jealousy and he should be jealous  of his wife, and she should not be defiled;

15. then [3shall lead 1the 2man]  his wife to the priest, and he shall bring the gift for her, the tenth of the ephah of flour of barley; he shall not pour upon it olive oil, nor shall he place upon it frankincense; for it is a sacrifice for jealousy, a sacrifice of memorial, calling to mind sin.

16. And [3shall bring 4her 1the 2priest], and stand her before the lord.

17. And [3shall take 1the 2priest 6water 4clean 5living] in [2receptacle 1an earthenware], and some of the earth  being upon the floor of the tent of the testimony; and taking it, the priest shall put it into the water.

18. And [3shall stand 1the 2priest] the woman before the lord, and he shall uncover the head of the woman, and he shall give unto  her hands the sacrifice  of memorial, the sacrifice  of jealousy; but in the hand of the priest will be the water  of rebuke, the one accursing this.

19. And [3shall adjure 4her 1the 2priest], and he shall say to the woman, If no one has gone to bed with you, if you have not violated to be defiled being under  [2husband  1your own], be innocent from [2by the 3water  4of rebuke  1this accursing]!

20. But if [2you 3violated 1being married], or were defiled, and any gave  of his marriage-bed with you, besides  your husband;

21. then [3shall bind 1the 2priest] the woman by the oaths  of this imprecation. And [3shall say 1the 2priest] to the woman, May [2appoint 3you 1the lord] to a curse and solemn affirmation in the midst  of your people, in the lord giving  of your thigh to miscarry, and  your belly to bloat;

22. and [3shall enter  2water  1this accursing] into  your belly to bloat pregnant and to miscarry by your thigh. And [3shall say 1the 2woman], May it be. May it be.

23. And [3shall write 1the 2priest]  these imprecations on a scroll, and shall wipe them away in the water of the rebuke of the accursing.

24. And he shall give to drink to the woman the water of the rebuke of the accursing; and shall enter into her the water of the rebuke of the accursing.

25. And [3shall take 1the 2priest] from out of the hand of the woman the sacrifice  of jealousy, and shall place the sacrifice before the lord. And he shall bring her unto the altar.

26. And [3shall grab 1the 2priest] from the sacrifice  as a memorial of it, and he shall offer it upon the altar; and after these things he will cause [3to drink 1the 2woman] the water.

27. And it shall be if she should be defiled, and in forgetfulness [2should be unaware  1her husband], then shall enter into her the water  of rebuke  of accursing, and [3shall bloat 1the 2belly], and [2shall miscarry  1her thigh]. And [3will be 1the 2woman] for a curse  to her people.

28. But if [3should not 4be defiled 1the 2woman], and should be clean, then she will be innocent, and shall produce offspring of semen.

29. This is the law of the jealousy in which ever [3should violate  1a woman 2being married] and should be defiled;

30. or a man who ever should have [3come 4upon 5him 1a spirit 2of jealousy], and should be jealous  of his wife, and should stand  his wife before the lord, then [3shall do 4to her 1the 2priest] all  this law.

31. And [3will be innocent 1the 2man] from sin. And that woman shall take the sin on herself.

14. and shall lead  his gift to the lord -- [3he-lamb 4of a year old 2unblemished 1one] for a whole burnt-offering, and [3ewe-lamb 4of a year old 1one 2unblemished] for a sin offering, and [3ram 1one 2unblemished] for a deliverance offering;

21. This is the law of the one making a vow; who ever should make a vow to the lord of his gift to the lord, concerning the vow, separate from what ever [2should find  1his hand] according to ability  of his vow, of what ever he should have vowed according to the law of his purity.

22. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Speak to Aaron and  his sons! saying, Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel, saying to them,

24. May [2bless 3you 1The lord], and keep you.

25. May the lord shine  his face upon you, and show mercy on you.

1.  Purification of the Levites And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak  to Aaron! And you shall say to him, Whenever you should place the lamps by rank, [5in 6front 7of the 8lamp-stand 4shall give light 1the 2seven 3lamps].

3. And [2did 3so 1Aaron]; in front of the lamp-stand he lit up  its lamps as the lord gave orders  to Moses.

4. And this is the apparatus of the lamp-stand; [2is solid 3gold,  1its stem], and  its lilies are solid entirely, according to the form which the lord showed  Moses -- thus he made the lamp-stand.

5. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and you shall purify them.

7. And thus you shall do to them  for their purification -- you shall sprinkle about them water of purification, and [2shall come 1a razor] upon the whole  of their body. And you shall wash  their garments, and they shall be clean.

8. And they shall take [2calf 1one] from the oxen, and of this a sacrifice offering of fine flour being prepared in olive oil. And a calf of a year old from the oxen you shall take for a sin offering.

9. And you shall lead forward the Levites before the tent of the testimony. And you shall bring together all the congregation of the sons of Israel.

10. And you shall lead forward the Levites before the lord, and [4shall place 1the 2sons 3of Israel]  their hands upon the Levites.

11. And Aaron shall separate the Levites for a gift before the lord from the sons of Israel. And they shall be so as to work the works of the lord.

12. And the Levites shall place the hands upon the heads of the calves. And you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the one for a whole burnt-offering to the lord to atone for them.

13. And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron, and before  his sons; and you shall give them back as a gift to the lord.

14. And you shall draw apart the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and they shall be mine.

15. And after these things [3shall enter 1the 2Levites] to work the works of the tent of the testimony. And you shall cleanse them, and render them before the lord.

16. For as a gift these are being given back to me; they are from out of the midst of the sons of Israel, in place of the ones opening wide every womb of all first-born of the sons of Israel; I have taken them to myself.

17. For [7is mine 1every 2first-born 3among 4the 5sons 6of Israel], from man unto beast; in which day I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself.

18. And I took the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel.

19. And I gave back the Levites as a gift, recompensing Aaron and to his sons from out of the midst of the sons of Israel, to work the works of the sons of Israel in the tent of the testimony, and to atone for the sons of Israel; and that [2shall not be 3among 4the 5sons 6of Israel 1a calamity] whenever drawing near to the holy things.

23. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

24. This is the thing for the Levites from five and twenty years and up. They shall enter to minister a ministration in works in the tent of the testimony.

25. And from fifty years old he shall leave from the ministration, and shall not work any longer.

26. And he shall officiate with his brethren in the tent of the testimony, to guard the watches; [4the works 1but 2he shall not 3work] -- so shall you do to the Levites in  their watches.

5. commencing on the fourteenth day of the month in the wilderness  of Sinai. As the lord gave orders  to Moses, thus [4did 1the 2sons 3of Israel].

6. And [2came  1men], the ones who were unclean by reason of touching a dead soul of a man, and they were not able to observe the passover in  that day. And they came forward before Moses and Aaron on that  day.

7. And [2said  1those men] to them, We are unclean by reason of the dead soul of a man. Are we then lacking so as to bring the gift to the lord according to its time in the midst of the sons of Israel?

8. And [2said 3to 4them 1Moses], Stand there and I will hear what the lord gives charge concerning you.

9. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel! saying, A man, a man who ever becomes unclean by reason of a dead soul of a man, or on a journey far from you, even among  your generations, he shall observe the passover to the lord.

11. In the [2month  1second], on the fourteenth day towards evening, they shall prepare it; upon unleavened breads and bitter herbs they shall eat it.

12. They shall not leave behind any of it into the morning, and [3a bone 1they shall not 2break] of it. According to the law of the passover they shall observe it.

13. And the man who ever might be clean, and [2on 3a journey 4far away 1is not], and should lack to observe the passovers, [2shall be utterly destroyed  1that soul] from  its people, because the gift to the lord he did not offer according to  its time; [3his sin 2shall take  1that man].

14. But if [2should come forward 3to 4you 1a foreigner] in  your land, and would observe the passover to the lord, then according to the law of the passover, and according to  its arrangement, thus he shall observe it. [3law 2one 1There will be] to you, both to the foreigner, and to the native born of the land. 

15.  The Cloud and the Fire And in the day which [3was set up 1the 2tent] [3covered 1the 2cloud] the tent -- the house of the testimony. And in the evening there was upon the tent as a form of fire until morning.

16. So it was always. The cloud covered it by day, and the form of fire by the night.

17. And when [3ascended 1the 2cloud] from the tent, then after this [4departed 1the 2sons 3of Israel]. And in the place where ever [3stopped 1the 2cloud], there [4camped 1the 2sons 3of Israel].

18. By order of the lord [4shall camp 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and by order of the lord they shall depart. All the days in which [3shadowed 1the 2cloud] over the tent, [4shall camp 1the 2sons 3of Israel].

19. And whenever [3should be dragged 1the 2cloud] upon the tent [2days 1for many], that [4shall guard 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the watch of the lord, and in no way shall they lift away.

20. And it shall be whenever [3should become 1the 2cloud 5of days 4a number] upon the tent; by the voice of the lord they shall camp, and by order of the lord they shall depart.

21. And it shall be whenever [3should be present 1the 2cloud] from evening until morning, and [3should ascend 1the 2cloud] in the morning, then they shall depart by day or night,

22. or [2a month 3of days 1when being more than] of the cloud shadowing upon it, [4shall camp 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and in no way shall they depart.

23. For by order of the lord they shall depart. [2the 3watch 4of the lord 1They guarded] by order of the lord by the hand of Moses.  

## Numbers 10

1.  The Signal of the Trumpets And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Make for yourself two trumpets of silver! A hammered work you shall make them, and they will be for you to call the congregation, and to lift away the camps.

3. And you shall trump with them, and bring together all the congregation unto the door of the tent of the testimony.

4. But if [2with 3one sound 1they should trump], then shall come forward to you all the rulers of the heads of Israel.

5. And you shall trump a signal, and shall lift away the camps  camping according to the east.

6. And you shall trump for a signal a second time, and shall lift away the camps  camping according to the south. And you shall trump [2signal 1a third], and shall lift away the camps  camping by the west. And you shall trump [2signal 1a fourth], and shall lift away the camps  camping towards the north. [2a signal 1You shall trump] at  their departure.

7. And whenever you should bring together the congregation, you shall trump, but not a signal.

8. And the sons of Aaron the priests shall trump with the trumpets; and it will be to you [2law 1an eternal] unto  your generations.

9. But if you should go forth to war in  your land against the opponents  opposing you, then you shall signify with the trumpets; and you will be called to mind before the lord  your God, and you shall be preserved from  your enemies.

10. And in the days  of your gladness, and in  your holidays, and in  your new moons, you shall trump with the trumpets at the whole burnt-offerings, and at the sacrifices  of your deliverance offerings. And it shall be to you for a remembrance before  your God. I am the lord  your God. 

11.  The Cloud Ascends And it came to pass in the [2year  1second], in the [2month  1second], the twentieth of the month, [3ascended 1the 2cloud] from the tent of the testimony.

12. And [4lifted away 1the 2sons 3of Israel] with their chattel in the wilderness  of Sinai. And [3stopped 1the 2cloud] in the wilderness  of Paran.

13. And [2lifted away 1the first ranks] by the voice of the lord by the hand of Moses.

14. And they lifted away in order, the camp of the sons of Judah first with their force. And over  their force was Nahshon son of Amminadab.

15. And over the force of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethaneel son of Zuar.

16. And over the force of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon.

17. And they shall lower the tent, and [4shall lift away 1the 2sons 3of Gershon], and the sons of Merari, the ones carrying the tent.

18. And lifted away in order the camp of Reuben with their force. And over  their force was Elizur son of Shedeur.

22. And shall lift away in order the camp of Ephraim with their force. And over  his force was Elishama son of Ammihud.

23. And over the force of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

26. And over the force of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel son of Ocran.

27. And over the force of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira son of Enan.

28. These are the militaries of the sons of Israel. And they lifted away with their force.

29. And Moses said  to Hobab son of Raguel the Midianite father-in-law of Moses, We are lifting away unto the place which the lord said, This I will give to you. Come with us and [2good 3for you 1we will do], for the lord spoke good concerning Israel.

30. And he said to him, I shall not go; but unto  my land, and unto  my family I will go.

31. And he said, You should not abandon us, because you were with us in the wilderness, and you will be among us as an ambassador.

32. And it shall be if you should go with us, that it shall be the good things that whatever as many as the lord shall do good for us, also [2good 3for you 1we shall do].

33. And they lifted away from the mountain of the lord, a journey of three days. And the ark of covenant of the lord went forth in front of them, a journey of three days, to survey themselves a rest.

34. And the cloud of the lord came to pass shadowing over them by day in  their lifting away from out of the camp.

35. And it came to pass in the lifting away the ark, that Moses said, Awaken! O lord, and let [2be dispersed  1your enemies]! and let flee all the ones detesting you!

36. And in the resting, he said, Turn! O lord, thousands of myriads in  Israel.  

## Numbers 11

1.  The People Grumble And [3were 1the 2people] grumbling wickedly before the lord. And the lord heard, and he became enraged in anger; and there burned among them a fire by the lord, and it devoured a certain part of the camp.

2. And [3cried out 1the 2people] to Moses. And Moses made a vow to the lord, and [3abated 1the 2fire].

3. And he called the name  of that place, Combustion, for [4burned 5among 6them 1fire 2by 3the lord].

4. And the intermixed people  among them desired with a great desire. And being seated, they wept along with the sons of Israel. And they said, Who will feed us meats?

5. We remember the fishes which we ate in Egypt without charge, and the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlics.

6. But now  our soul is dried up; there is nothing except for the manna to our eyes.

7. And the manna is as seed, it is as of coriander, and the appearance of it is the appearance of ice.

8. And [3traveled around 1the 2people] and collected together, and ground it with the millstone, and ground with the hand mill, and boiled it in the earthen pot, and made it into a cake baked in hot ashes. And [4was 1the 2satisfaction 3from eating it] as the taste of pastry made with olive oil.

9. And whenever [3came down 1the 2dew] upon the camp at night, [3came down 1the 2manna] upon it.

10. And Moses heard their weeping, according to their peoples, each at  his door. And [2was enraged 3in anger 1the lord] exceedingly; and before Moses it was wicked.

11. And Moses said to the lord, Why do you afflict  your attendant? And why have I not found favor before you to place the thrust  of this people upon me?

12. Have I [2in 3the womb 1conceived] all  this people, or have I given birth to them? that you say to me, Take them into  your bosom as [2lifts 1a wet-nurse] the one being nursed, unto the land which you swore by an oath to their fathers?

13. From what place is it to me [2meats 1to give] to all  this people? for they weep upon me, saying, Give to us meats that we may eat!

14. [2shall not 3be able 1I] alone to bring  this people, for [3heavy 4for me 2is  1this matter].

15. But if so you do to me, kill me with my removal, if I have found favor with you, that I should not see  my ill-treatment.

16. And the lord said to Moses, Bring together to me seventy men from the elders of Israel! whom you yourself know. These are elders of the people, and their scribes. And you shall lead them to the tent of the testimony, and they shall stand there with you.

17. And I shall go down and speak there with you. And I will remove of the spirit  upon you, and I will place it upon them, and they shall aid with you the thrust of the people, and [2shall not 3bring 4them 1you] alone. 

18.  God Sends Meat And to the people you shall say, Purify yourselves for tomorrow! and you shall eat meats, for you wept before the lord, saying, Who shall feed us meats? for [2good 3to us 1it was] being in Egypt. And the lord shall give to you meats and you shall eat.

19. [2not 5day 4for one 1You shall 3eat], nor two, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,

20. [2for 3a month 4of days 1you shall eat], until whenever it should come forth from out of  your nostrils; and it shall be to you for a cholera, that you resisted the lord who is among you, and you wept before him, saying, What did we do to come out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, six hundred thousand footmen are the people in which I am among them. And you said, [3meats 1I will give 2them], and they shall eat for a month of days.

22. Shall sheep and oxen be slain for them, and will it suffice to them? or shall all the fish of the sea be brought to them, and will it suffice to them?

23. And the lord said to Moses, Shall the hand of the lord not be enough? Already you shall know if [2shall overtake 3you  1my word] or not.

24. And Moses came forth, and he spoke to the people the sayings of the lord. And he brought together seventy men from the elders of the people, and he stood them round about the tent.

25. And the lord came down in a cloud, and he spoke to him, and he lifted from the spirit, of the one upon him, and he placed it upon the seventy men of the elders. And as [2rested 1spirit] upon them, that they prophesied, and no longer proceeded.

26. And were left behind two men in the camp; the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad; and [3rested 4upon 5them 1the 2spirit], and these were of the ones delineated, and came not to the tent; and they prophesied in the camp.

27. And [2ran up  1a young man] to report to Moses, and said, saying, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.

28. And answering Joshua the son of Nun, the one standing beside Moses,  his chosen one, said, O my master Moses, restrain them!

29. And Moses said to him, Are you zealous for me? and O how it would be given all the people of the lord were prophets, whenever the lord should put  his spirit upon them.

30. And Moses went forth into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

31. And a wind went forth from the lord, and carried over mother-quail from the sea, and it put them upon the camp, [2journey 1a days] here on this side, and [2journey 1a days] here on that side, round about the camp, about two cubits from the earth.

32. And [3rose up 1the 2people 5entire  6day 4that], and the entire night, and the entire  [2day  1next]; and they gathered together the mother-quail -- the one [2a few 1gathering] was ten cors. And they cooled themselves in a time of refreshing round about the camp.

33. The meats still was in  their teeth before the dissipating. And the lord was enraged in wrath at the people. And the lord struck the people [3calamity 2great 1an exceedingly].

34. And [4was called 1the 2name  3of that place], Tombs  of Desire. For there they entombed the [2people  1craving].

35. From Tombs of the Desire [3lifted away 1the 2people] unto Hazeroth; and [3existed 1the 2people] in Hazeroth.  

## Numbers 12

1.  Miriam and Aaron Speak against Moses And [4spoke 1Miriam 2and 3Aaron] against Moses, because of the Ethiopian wife, whom Moses took, for [2an Ethiopian woman 1he took].

2. And they said, Has [3only to Moses 2spoken 1the lord]? Did he not also speak to us? And the lord heard.

3. And the man Moses was [2gentle 1exceedingly] above all the men of the ones being upon the earth.

4. And the lord said immediately to Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam, Come forth you the three into the tent of the testimony!

5. And came forth the three into the tent of the testimony. And the lord came down in a column of cloud, and it stood at the door of the tent of the testimony. And [4were called 1Aaron 2and 3Miriam], and [2came forth 1both].

6. And he said to them, Hear  my words. If there should be a prophet among you to the lord, [3in 4a vision 2to him 1I will be made known], and in sleep I will speak to him.

7. Not so  my attendant Moses; in [2entire  3house 1my] he is trustworthy.

8. Mouth to mouth I will speak to him in sight, and not through enigmas; even [2the 3glory 4of the lord 1he saw]. And why were you not afraid to speak ill against  my attendant Moses?

9. And anger of rage of the lord was upon them, and they went forth.

10. And the cloud left from the tent. And behold, Miriam became leprous as snow. And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.

11. And Aaron said to Moses, I beseech you, O my master, you should not join sin to us, for we knew not that we sinned.

12. Do not let her become as equal to death, as a miscarriage going forth from a womb of his mother, and it eats up  half  of her flesh.

13. And Moses yelled out to the lord, saying, O God, I beseech you to heal her.

14. And the lord said to Moses, If  her father in spitting, spat into  her face, would she not feel shame? Seven days she shall be separated outside the camp, and after this she shall enter.

15. And Miriam was separated outside the camp seven days; and the people did not lift away until Miriam was cleansed.

16. And after these things [3lifted away 1the 2people] from Hazeroth, and they camped in the wilderness  of Paran.  

## Numbers 13

1.  Moses Sends Men to Survey the Land And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Send for yourself men, and let them survey the land of the Canaanites! which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession. [2man 1One] per tribe; according to the peoples of their patrimony you shall send them, all being chiefs of them.

3. And [2sent 3them 1Moses] from the wilderness of Paran, by the voice of the lord. All [2men 3were chiefs 4of the sons 5of Israel 1these].

4. And these are  their names. Of the tribe of Reuben was Shammua son of Zaccur.

5. Of the tribe of Simeon was Shaphat son of Hori.

6. Of the tribe of Judah was Caleb son of Jephunneh.

7. Of the tribe of Issachar was Igal son of Joseph.

8. Of the tribe of Ephraim was Oshea son of Nun.

9. Of the tribe of Benjamin was Palti son of Raphu.

10. Of the tribe of Zebulun was Gaddiel son of Sodi.

11. Of the tribe of Joseph of the sons of Manasseh was Gaddi son of Susi.

12. Of the tribe of Dan was Ammiel son of Gamalli.

13. Of the tribe of Asher was Sethur son of Michael.

14. Of the tribe of Naphtali was Nahbi son of Vophsi.

15. Of the tribe of Gad was Geuel son of Machi.

16. These are the names of the men which Moses sent to survey the land. And Moses named  Oshea son of Nun -- Joshua.

17. And [2sent 3them 1Moses] to survey the land of Canaan. And he said to them, Ascend in this  wilderness! And you shall ascend into the mountain.

18. And you will behold the land, what it is, and the people  lying in wait upon it, if they are strong or weak; or if they are few, or many.

19. And what the land is like in which these lie in wait upon it, if it is good, or wicked; and what the cities in which these dwell in them, if in walled or in unwalled.

20. And what the land is like, if plentiful or being neglected; if there is in it trees or not. And attending to constantly you shall take from the fruits of the land. And the days were days in spring, forerunners of the grape.

21. And ascending they surveyed the land from the wilderness of Zin until Rehob, entering Hamath.

22. And they ascended by the wilderness, and came unto Hebron; and there was Ahiman, and Sheshai, and Talmai, the families of Anak; and Hebron [2seven 3years 1was built] before  Tanin of Egypt.

23. And they came unto the Ravine of the Cluster. And they beat from there a vine branch and [2cluster 3of the grape 1one] from it; and they lifted it upon bearing poles, and some from the pomegranates, and  the fig-trees.

24. And  that place they named Ravine of the Cluster, on account of the cluster of grapes which [4beat 5from there 1the 2sons 3of Israel].

25. And they returned from there [2surveying 3the 4land 1after] forty days.

26. And having gone, they came to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran Kadesh. And they answered to them a word, and to all the congregation. And they showed the fruit of the land.

27. And they described to him, and they said, We came into the land unto which you sent us, a land flowing milk and honey. And this is  its fruit.

28. Only that [6is bold 1the 2nation  3dwelling 4the 5land], and the [2cities 1fortified], being walled, are great -- very much so. And the generation of Anak we saw there.

29. And Amalek dwells in the land, in the land to the south; and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the mountainous area; and the Canaanite dwell by the sea, and by the Jordan river. 

30.  Caleb's Report And Caleb quelled the people before Moses, and said to him, Not so, but ascending we will ascend, and we shall inherit it; for by might we shall be able to prevail against them.

31. And the men, the ones going up with him said, We are not ascending; for in no way should we be able to ascend to that nation, for [2stronger 4than us 1it is 3rather].

32. And they brought an astonishment of the land of which they surveyed it to the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we went in it to survey -- [2a land 3devouring 4the ones 5dwelling 6upon 7it 1it is]; and all the people whom we see in it [2men 1are exceedingly tall].

33. And there we saw the giants; and we were [3in the presence of 4them 1as 2locusts]; yes, even so we were in the presence of them.  

## Numbers 14

1.  The Israelites Fear the Canaanites And taking up, all the congregation gave a sound, and [3wept 1the 2people 5entire  6night 4that].

2. And they complained over Moses and Aaron -- all the sons of Israel. And [4said 5to 6them 1all 2the 3congregation], Ought that we should die in the land of Egypt, than [2in  3this wilderness 1we should die].

3. And why did the lord bring us into  this land to fall in war?  Our wives and  children will be for ravaging. Now then [2best 3for us 1it is] to return to Egypt.

4. And [2said 1the other] to the other, We should appoint a chief, and we should return unto Egypt.

5. And [3fell 1Moses and 2Aaron] upon their face before all the congregation of the sons of Israel.

6. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of the ones surveying the land, tore  their cloaks.

7. And they said to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we surveyed it, it is good exceedingly exceedingly.

8. If [2selected 3us 1the lord], he will bring us into  this land, and he will give it to us; a land which is flowing milk and honey.

9. But from  the lord do not [2defectors 1become]; And you, do not fear the people of the land! for [2a thing devoured 3for us 1they are]. [4has left 1for 2the 3time] from them, and the lord is among us; do not fear them!

10. And [4said 1all 2the 3congregation] to stone them with stones. And the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud upon the tent of the testimony among all the sons of Israel.

11. And the lord said to Moses, For how long does [2provoke 3me  1this people]? And for how long do they not trust me, for all the signs which I did among them?

12. I will strike them in death, and I will destroy them, and I will make you into [4nation 1a great 2and 3populous] rather than this one. 

13.  Moses Pleads on Behalf of the People And Moses said to the lord, And Egypt shall hear that you led  [3by your strength  2people 1this] from them,

14. but also all the ones dwelling upon  this land have heard, that you are the lord among  this people, who eyes to eyes you behold, O lord, and  your cloud stands over them, and in a column of cloud you go in front of them by the day, and in a column of fire by the night.

15. And shall you obliterate  this people as [2man 1one]? and [3shall say 1the 2nations], as many as heard  your name, saying,

16. Because the [2was not 3able 1 lord] to bring  this people into the land which he swore by an oath to them, he prostrated them in the wilderness.

17. And now, raise up high  your strength, O lord, in which manner you said, saying,

18. The lord is lenient, and full of mercy, and true, removing lawless deeds, and iniquities, and sins; but by cleansing he shall not cleanse the liable, repaying the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.

19. Dismiss the sin  of this people according to  [2great 3mercy 1your], just as kindness happened to them from Egypt until the present.

20. And the lord said, [2kind 3to them 1I am] according to  your word;

21. but as I live, that [4will fill 1the 2glory 3of the lord] all the earth.

22. For all the men  seeing  my glory, and the signs which I did in Egypt, and in  this wilderness, and test me this tenth time, and are not listening to  my voice,

23. assuredly they shall not see the land which I swore by an oath to their fathers; but only  their children who are with me here, as many as have not known good or evil, every young one inexperienced, to these I will give the land. But all the ones provoking me shall not see it.

24.  But my servant Caleb, for [3is 2spirit 1another] in him, and he followed after me, I will bring him into the land into which you enter there, and  his seed shall inherit it.

25.  But Amalek and the Canaanites dwell in the valley. Tomorrow you should turn and depart into the wilderness way [2sea 1of the red].

26. And the lord said to Moses and Aaron, saying,

27. For how long shall I endure  [2congregation  1this wicked], in which they grumble before me? The grumbling of the sons of Israel, which they grumble concerning you, I have heard.

28. Say to them, as I live, says the lord, assuredly in which manner you spoke into  my ears, so I will do for you.

29. In  this wilderness [2shall fall  1your carcasses], even all  overseeing you, and the ones being counted of you from twenty years old and up, as many as grumbled against me.

30. Shall you enter into the land upon which I stretched out  my hand to encamp you upon it, no. But only Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun,

31. and the children who you said, [2for 3ravaging 1to be], I will bring them into the land which you abstained from it.

32. And  your carcasses will fall in  this wilderness.

33. But your sons will be fed in the wilderness forty years. And they shall bear  your harlotry, until whenever [2should be consumed  1your carcasses] in the wilderness.

34. According to the number of the days, as many as you surveyed the land -- forty days; a day for the year you will take  for your sins -- forty years; and you shall know the rage  of my anger.

35. I the lord spoke. Assuredly thus I will do  [2congregation  1to this wicked], to the one rising up together against me. In  this wilderness they shall be completely consumed, and there they shall die.

36. And the men whom Moses sent to survey the land, and coming, complained concerning this to the congregation, to bring forth [2words 1bad] concerning the land,

37. and they died, the men  avowing bad things concerning the land in the calamity before the lord.

38. And Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh lived of  those men, of the ones going to survey the land.

39. And Moses spoke  these words to all the sons of Israel; and [3mourned 1the 2people] exceedingly.

40. And rising early in the morning, they ascended into the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we shall ascend unto the place which the lord spoke, for we sinned.

41. And Moses said, Why do you violate the word of the lord? it will not be prosperous for you.

42. Do not ascend, [4not 1for 3is 2the lord] with you. And you shall fall before the face  of your enemies.

43. For  Amalek and the Canaanite are there in front of you, and you shall fall by the sword, because you were turned resisting the persuasion by the lord, and [2will not be 1the lord] with you.

44. And forcing through, they ascended upon the top of the mountain. But the ark of the covenant of the lord, and Moses did not move from out of the midst of the camp.

45. And [2came down  1Amalekite], and the Canaanite  lying in wait in  that mountain, and they routed them, and they slew them unto Hormah.  

## Numbers 15

1.  The Law Regarding Offerings And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, Whenever you should enter into the land  of your dwelling, which I give to you,

3. and you shall offer yield offerings to the lord, or a whole burnt-offering, or sacrifice offering to magnify a vow, or concerning a voluntary offering, or in  your holiday feasts, you shall offer a scent of pleasant aroma to the lord, either from the oxen or from the sheep.

4. That [3shall bring 1the 2one offering]  his gift to the lord being a sacrifice of fine flour -- the tenth of the ephah, being prepared in olive oil, in a fourth of the hin.

5. And wine for a libation offering, the fourth of the hin, you shall offer upon the whole burnt-offering, or upon the sacrifice offering to the [2lamb  1one].

6. And for the ram, whenever you offer it for a whole burnt-offering or for a sacrifice offering, you shall prepare a sacrifice of fine flour -- two tenths being prepared in olive oil, the third of the hin.

7. And wine for a libation, the third of the hin, you shall offer for a scent of pleasant aroma to the lord.

8. But if from the oxen you should offer for a whole burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice offering to magnify a vow, or for a deliverance offering to the lord,

9. then he shall bring with the calf for a sacrifice offering of fine flour, three tenths being prepared in olive oil, a half of the hin.

10. And the wine for a libation, the half of the hin -- a yield offering scent of pleasant aroma to the lord.

11. Thus you shall offer for the [2calf  1one], or the [2ram  1one], or the [2lamb  1one] from the sheep, or a kid of the goats.

12. According to the number which ever you should offer, so you shall do to the one, according to  their number.

13. Every  native born shall offer thus, such as to bring yield offerings for a scent of pleasant aroma to the lord.

14. And if a foreigner among you should unite in  your land, or who ever was born to you among  your generations, and he shall offer a yield offering scent of pleasant aroma to the lord, in which manner you do yourselves -- so shall [3offer 1the 2congregation] to the lord.

15. [2law 1One] will be to you and to the foreigners  lying near to you, [2law 1an eternal] unto  your generations. As you, also the foreigner will be before the lord.

16. [3law 2one 1There shall be], and [3ordinance 2one 1there shall be] to you and to the foreigner  lying near to you.

17. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to the sons of Israel! And you shall say to them, In  your entering into the land, into which I bring you there,

19. that it will be whenever you yourselves should eat from the bread loaves of the land, you shall remove a cut-away portion as a separation offering to the lord, a first-fruit of your batch of dough.

20. [2bread 1You shall separate] as a cut-away portion to him. As a cut-away portion from the threshing-floor, thus shall you remove it.

21. As first-fruit of your batch, even you shall give it to the lord as cut-away portion for  your generations.

22. And whenever you should miss entirely, and should not observe all  these commandments which the lord spoke to Moses;

23. as the lord gave orders for you by the hand of Moses, from the day of which the lord gave orders to you and beyond unto  your generations;

24. that it shall be if from the eyes of the congregation it should happen unintentionally, then [4shall offer 1all 2the 3congregation] [2calf 1one] from the oxen, unblemished, for a whole burnt-offering, for a scent of pleasant aroma to the lord, and this sacrifice offering, and its libation, according to  its arrangement, and [2winter yearling 3from out of 4the goats 1one] for a sin offering.

25. And [3shall make atonement 1the 2priest] for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it is unintentional. And they brought  their gift, a yield offering to the lord for  their sins, before the lord for  their unintentional sins.

26. And [5it shall be forgiven 1to all 2the congregation 3of the sons 4of Israel], and to the foreigner  lying near to you, for to all the people it is unintentional.

27. And if [2soul 1one] should sin unintentionally, he shall lead forward one goat of a year old for a sin offering.

28. And [3shall atone 1the 2priest] for the soul of the one acting unintentionally, and sinning unintentionally before the lord, to atone for him, and to forgive him.

29. To the native inhabitant among the sons of Israel, and to the foreigner  lying near to them, [3law 2one 1there shall be] to them, who ever should do it unintentionally.

30. And the soul who shall do a thing by hand through pride -- of the native born, or of the foreigners --  [3God 1this one 2provokes], and [2shall be utterly destroyed  1that soul] from out of  its people,

31. for the word of the lord he treated as worthless, and  his commandments he effaced; by obliteration [2shall be obliterated  1that soul];  his sin be on him.

32. And [4were 1the 2sons 3of Israel] in the wilderness, and they found a man collecting together wood on the day of the Sabbath.

33. And [6led 7him forward 1the ones 2finding 3him 4collecting 5wood] to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel.

34. And they put him under guard, [3not 1for 2they did] interpret what they should do with him.

35. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying, Unto death put to death the man! You shall stone him with stones -- all the congregation outside the camp.

36. And [4led 5him 1all 2the 3congregation] outside the camp; and they stoned him, as the lord gave orders  to Moses.

37. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

38. Speak to the sons of Israel! And you shall say to them, and let them make for themselves decorative hems upon the borders  of their cloaks throughout  their generations. And you shall place upon the decorative hems of the borders yarn of blue.

39. And it will be to you in the decorative hems, that as you shall see them, then [5shall be remembered 1all 2the 3commandments 4of the lord]. And you shall do them, and you shall not turn aside after  your own considerations, and after  your eyes in which you fornicate after them,

40. so that you should remember and should do all  my commandments. And you shall be holy to your God.

41. I am the lord  your God, the one leading you from out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am the lord  your God.  

## Numbers 16

1.  Korah Complains against Moses And Korah spoke, the son of Izhar, son of Kohath son of Levi; and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth son of Reuben.

2. And they rose up before Moses, and men of the sons of Israel -- fifty and two hundred, chiefs of the congregation, summoned counselors, and [2men 1famous].

3. They stood together against Moses and Aaron. And said to them, Let this suffice to you, that all the congregation are all holy -- and [2is among 3them 1the lord]; and why do you stand against the congregation of the lord?

4. And hearing, Moses fell upon his face.

5. And he spoke to Korah and to all the congregation, saying, [2has visited 3and 4knows  1God] the ones being his; and the ones holy he led to himself; and whom he chose not for himself, he led not to himself.

6. This you do! You take to yourselves censers, Korah and all  his gathering!

7. And put [2upon 3them 1fire]! And put upon them incense before the lord tomorrow! And it will be the man who ever the lord should choose, this one shall be holy. Let it be suitable to you sons of Levi!

8. And Moses said to Korah, Listen to me sons of Levi!

9.  [3a small thing 1Is 2this] for you, that [2separated 3you  1God] from the congregation of Israel, and led you to himself to officiate the ministrations of the tent of the lord, and to stand before the congregation to serve to them?

10. And he led you, and all  your brethren of the sons of Levi with you, and do you seek to officiate as priest also?

11. Thus you and all  your gathering  are gathering together against  God. And [3Aaron 1who 2is] that you complain against him?

12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab. And they said, We do not ascend to you.

13. Is this a small thing that you led us from a land flowing milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you rule us, and be a ruler,

14. and into a land flowing milk and honey you brought us, and you gave to us a lot of inheritance of field and vineyards? [2the 3eyes  4of those men 1Would you have cut out]? We do not ascend.

15. And Moses was weighed down exceedingly. And he said to the lord, Do not take heed to  their sacrifice, [2not 4the desire 5of any one 6of them 1I have 3taken], nor inflicted evil on any one of them.

16. And Moses said to Korah, Sanctify  your congregation, and come prepared before the lord, you and they, and Aaron tomorrow!

17. And let [2take 1each]  his censer! and you shall put [2upon 3them 1incense], and [2shall bring 3before 4the lord 1each]  his censer, fifty and two hundred censers; and you and Aaron each  shall bring his censer.

18. And [2took 1each]  his own censer, and they put upon them fire, and they put upon them incense. And stood by the doors of the tent  of testimony Moses and Aaron.

19. And [2rose up together 3against 4them 1Korah], the whole of his congregation, by the door of the tent of the testimony. And appeared the glory of the lord to all the congregation.

20. And the lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

21. Sever yourselves from the midst  of this congregation! and I will completely consume them at once.

22. And they fell upon their face. And they said, The God, the God of the spirits and of all flesh, if [2man 1one] sinned, shall there be upon all the congregation the anger of the lord?

23. And the lord said to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the congregation! saying, Withdraw round about from the congregation of Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram!

25. And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram. And went with him all the elders of Israel.

26. And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Sever from the tents  [3men  2recalcitrant 1of these], and do not touch of all as much as is to them. You should not be destroyed together in all  their sin.

27. And [5left 6from 7the 8tent 9of Korah 1both 2Dathan 3and 4Abiram] round about. And Dathan and Abiram came forth and stood by the doors  of their tents, and  their wives, and  their children, and  their belongings.

28. And Moses said, By this you shall know that the lord sent me to execute all  these works, that they are not of myself.

29. If by the common death of all men these shall die; or if according to the review of all men the visit of death shall be theirs -- [2has not 1then the lord] sent me.

30. But if by a visible manifestation the lord shall show, and [3opening 1the 2earth]  its mouth shall swallow them, and  their houses, and  their tents, and all as much as is theirs, and they shall go down alive into Hades, then you shall know that [2provoked  1these men] the lord. 

31.  The Earth Swallows Korah And as he ceased speaking all  these words, [3was torn 1the 2earth] underneath them.

32. And [3was opened 1the 2earth], and it swallowed them, and  their houses, and all the men of the ones being with Korah, and all  their cattle.

33. And these went down, and all as many as is to them, alive into Hades; and [3covered 4them 1the 2earth], and they were destroyed from out of the midst of the congregation.

34. And all Israel  round about them fled from  their sound, saying, Lest at any time [3shall swallow 4us 1the 2earth].

35. And fire came forth from the lord, and it devoured the fifty and two hundred men of the ones offering the incense.

36. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

37. Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, Do away with the censers from the midst of the ones having been incinerated, and  [3fire  2alien 1sow this] there!

38. For they sanctified the censers  of these sinners by  their lives. And make them into scales hammered out for adornment to the altar! for they were brought near before the lord, and were sanctified. And they became for a sign to the sons of Israel.

39. And [6took 1Eleazar 2son 3of Aaron 4the 5priest] the censers  of brass, as many as [3brought near 1the 2men having been incinerated]; and they added them as an adornment to the altar,

40. as a memorial for the sons of Israel, how that not [3come forward 1should anyone 2foreign 4who 6not 5is] of the seed of Aaron, to place incense before the lord; so that he shall not be as Korah, and the ones conspiring with him, as the lord spoke by the hand of Moses to him. 

41.  Israel Grumbles against Moses and Aaron And [4grumbled 1the 2sons 3of Israel] the next day against Moses and Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of the lord.

42. And it came to pass in the gathering together the congregation against Moses and Aaron, that they advanced against the tent of the testimony; and thus [3covered 4it 1the 2cloud], and there appeared the glory of the lord.

43. And [4entered 1Moses 2and 3Aaron] by the front of the tent of the testimony.

44. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

45. Withdraw from the midst  of this congregation, and I shall completely consume them at once. And they fell upon their face.

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer, and place upon it fire from the altar, and put upon it incense, and carry it  quickly into the congregation, and make atonement for them! [3came forth 1For 2anger] from the face of the lord; it has begun to devastate the people.

47. And Aaron took just as [2spoke 3to him 1Moses]; and he ran into the congregation, for already had commenced the devastation among the people. And he put the incense, and he made atonement for the people.

48. And he stood between the ones having died and the ones living, and [3abated 1the 2devastation].

49. And [6were 1the ones 2having died 3in 4the 5devastation] fourteen thousand and seven hundred, apart from the ones having died because of Korah.

50. And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tent of the testimony, and [3abated 1the 2devastation].  

## Numbers 17

1.  The Twelve Rods And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel! And take from them a rod! a rod according to the houses of the patrimony, from all  their rulers, according to the houses of their patrimony -- twelve rods. And for each [2the 3name 1inscribe] upon  his rod!

3. And the name of Aaron you shall inscribe upon the rod of Levi. For it is [2rod 1one] according to the tribe of the house of their patrimony.

4. And you shall put them in the tent of the testimony, over against the testimony, in which I will be made known to you there.

5. And it shall be the man who ever I should choose him,  his rod shall sprout forth. And I will remove from you the grumbling of the sons of Israel, as much as they grumble against you.

6. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel; and [4gave 5to him 1all 2the 3rulers] their rod -- to the [2ruler  1one] [2rod 1one], according to the ruler, according to the houses of their patrimony -- twelve rods. And the rod of Aaron was in the midst  of their rods.

7. And Moses put aside the rods before the lord in the tent of the testimony.

8. And it came to pass in the next day, that Moses entered into the tent of the testimony; and behold, [4sprouted 1the 2rod 3of Aaron] for the house of Levi; and it brought forth a bud, and it blossomed a flower, and sprouted walnuts.

9. And Moses brought forth all the rods from in front of the lord to all the sons of Israel. And they saw, and [2took 1each]  his rod.

10. And the lord said to Moses, Put aside the rod of Aaron before the testimony! for preservation for a sign to the sons of the unhearing. And let cease  their grumbling of me! so in no way they shall die.

11. And [4did 1Moses 2and 3Aaron] as the lord gave orders to Moses -- so they did.

12. And [4said 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to Moses, saying, Behold, we have been completely consumed, we have been destroyed, we all have been uselessly consumed,

13. every  one touching the tent of the lord dies. Until completion should we die?  

## Numbers 18

1.  Aaron and His Sons Officiate And the lord said to Aaron, You and  your sons, and the house  of your father with you shall take the sins associated with the holies; and you and  your sons with you shall take the sins  associated with your priesthood.

2. And  your brethren the tribe of Levi, the people  of your father, you lead them to yourself, and let them be added to you, and let them officiate to you! even you and  your sons with you before the tent of the testimony.

3. And they shall guard  your watches, and the watches of the tent; except for the items of the holies and for the altar they shall not draw near, so that they shall not die, even these and you.

4. And they shall be added to you, and shall guard the watches of the tent of the testimony, concerning all the ministrations of the tent. And the foreigner shall not draw near to you.

5. And you shall guard the watches of the holy places, and the watches of the altar. And there shall not be yet rage among the sons of Israel.

6. And behold, I have taken  your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel as a gift being given to the lord, to officiate the ministrations of the tent of the testimony.

7. And you and  your sons after you shall observe  your priesthood according to every manner of the altar, and the thing within the veil; and you shall officiate the ministrations as a gift  of your priesthood. And the foreigner  going to it shall die.

8. And the lord spoke to Aaron, And behold, I give to you the preservation  of my first-fruits of all the things having been sanctified by the sons of Israel. To you I give them as an honor, and to your sons [2law 1for an eternal].

9. And let this be to you from the [2having been sanctified 1holy things] of the yield offerings, from all  their gifts, and from all  their sacrifices, and from all their trespass offerings, and from all  their sin offerings! as many as they give back to me of all of the holy things, it shall be to you and to your sons.

10. In the holy of the holies, you eat them! Let every male eat them! They shall be holy to you.

11. And this will be to you of the first-fruits of their gifts, from all the increase offerings of the sons of Israel. To you I have given them, and to your sons, and to your daughters after you -- [2law 1an eternal]. Every clean person in  your house shall eat them.

12. Every first-fruit of olive oil, and every first-fruit of wine, and [2of grain 1of their first-fruit], as many things as they should give to the lord, to you I have given them.

13. [2the 3first produce 1All], as many things as are in  their land, as many things as they should bring to the lord, it will be yours; every clean person in  your house shall eat them.

14. Every thing being devoted to consumption by the sons of Israel shall be to you.

15. And every thing opening wide the womb of all flesh, as many things as they offer to the lord, from man unto beast, it will be to you; only with ransoms you shall ransom the first-born  of men; and the first-born of the [2cattle  1unclean] you shall ransom.

16. And the ransoming of him from a month old -- the price is five shekels, according to the [2shekel  1holy] -- twenty oboli they are worth.

17. Except the first-born of calves, and the first-born of sheep, and the first-born of goats you shall not ransom, [2holy 1they are]. And  their blood you shall pour upon the altar, and the fat you shall offer as a yield offering for a scent of pleasant aroma to the lord.

18. And the meats will be yours, as also the breast of the increase offering. And accordingly the [2shoulder  1right] will be yours.

19. Every cut-away portion of the holy things, as many things as [4should remove 1the 2sons 3of Israel] to the lord, to you I have given, and to your sons, and to your daughters after you -- [2law 1an eternal]. [2covenant 3of salt 1It is an eternal] before the lord to you and to your seed after you.

20. And the lord spoke to Aaron, In  their land you shall not be an heir, and a portion shall not be to you among them; for I am your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.

21. And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given every tenth part in Israel by lot for  their ministrations, as much as they shall officiate the ministration in the tent of the testimony.

22. And [4shall not 5come forward 6still 1the 2sons 3of Israel] into the tent of the testimony, so as to take on sin causing death.

23. And [4shall officiate 1the 2Levite 3himself] the ministration of the tent of the testimony; and they shall take  their sins. [2law 1It is an eternal] into  their generations. And in the midst of the sons of Israel they shall not be an heir of an inheritance,

24. for the tenth parts of the sons of Israel, as many things as they should separate to the lord, a cut-away portion I give to the Levites by lot. On account of this I have said to them, Among the midst of the sons of Israel they shall not be an heir of a lot.

25. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

26. And to the Levites you shall speak, and you shall say to them, If you should take from the sons of Israel the tenth part, which I have given to you from them for a lot, then you shall remove to yourselves from it a cut-away portion to the lord, a tenth of the tenth part.

27. And [2shall be considered 3for you  1your cut-away portions] as grain from the threshing-floor, and as a cut-away portion from the wine-vat.

28. So you shall remove, even you yourselves, from all the cut-away portions of the lord, from all  your tenth parts; as many things as you should take from the sons of Israel; and you shall give of them a cut-away portion to the lord, through Aaron the priest.

29. From all  your gifts you shall remove a cut-away portion to the lord, from all the first-fruits  having been sanctified of it.

30. And you shall say to them, Whenever you should remove the first-fruit from it, then shall it be considered the Levites as produce from the threshing-floor, and as produce from the wine-vat.

31. And you shall eat it in any place, you and  your households; for [3the wage 1this 4to you 2is] for  your ministrations of the things in the tent of the testimony.

32. And you shall not take [2because of 3it 1sin], in that you should remove the first-fruit from it. And the holy things of the sons of Israel you shall not profane, that you should not die.  

## Numbers 19

1.  The Law Regarding the Reddish Heifer And the lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2. This is a distinction of the law, as many things as the lord ordered, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel! And let them take to you [3heifer 2reddish 1an unblemished]! which [2is not on 3it 1a blemish], and which [2was not put 3upon 4it 1a yoke].

3. And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest; and they shall lead it outside the camp, and they shall slay her before him.

4. And Eleazar shall take of  her blood, and he shall sprinkle it before the front of the tent of the testimony of  her blood seven times.

5. And you shall incinerate her before him, and  her skin, and  her meats, and  her blood with  her dung shall be incinerated.

6. And [3shall take 1the 2priest] wood of cedar, and hyssop, and scarlet; and they shall put them in the midst of the burning of the heifer.

7. And [3shall wash  4his garments 1the 2priest], and bathe  his body in water; and after these things he shall enter into the camp, and [3shall be unclean 1the 2priest] until evening.

8. And the one incinerating her shall wash  his garments in water, and shall bathe  his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening.

9. And [3shall gather together 2man 1a clean] the ashes of the heifer, and shall put them aside outside the camp in [2place 1a clean]. And it shall be for the congregation of the sons of Israel for preservation. [2water 3of sprinkling 1It is a purification].

10. And the one gathering the ashes of the heifer shall wash  his garments, and will be unclean until evening. And it will be to the sons of Israel, and to the foreigners lying nearby in the midst of you [2law 1an eternal].

11. The one touching  [4having died 1any 2departed soul 3of a man] will be unclean seven days.

12. This one shall be purified on the [2day  1third] and the [2day  1seventh], and he will be clean. But if he should not be purified on the [2day  1third], and on the [2day  1seventh], he will not be clean.

13. Every  one touching the one having died of the departed soul of a man, if he should die, and the other should not have been purified, the tent of the lord is defiled; and [2shall be obliterated  1that soul] from Israel, for water of sprinkling was not sprinkled about upon him; he is unclean; [4still  2uncleanness 1his 5with 6him 3is].

14. And this is the law. A man, if he should die in a house, every  one entering into the house, and as many as are in the house, will be unclean seven days.

15. And every item being open, as many as have not [2with a bond 1been bound] upon it is unclean.

16. And all who ever should touch upon the face of the plain one slain, or a dead corpse, or of a bone of mankind, or tomb, for seven days he will be unclean.

17. And they shall take for the unclean some of the ashes of the thing having been incinerated for the purification, and shall pour out upon it [2water 1living] into a utensil.

18. And [3shall take 4hyssop 5and 6shall dip it 7into 8the 9water 2man 1a clean], and sprinkle about upon the house, and upon the utensils, and upon the souls, as many as might be there, and upon the one touching the bone  of mankind, or of the slain, or of the one having died, or of the tomb.

19. And [3shall sprinkle about 1the 2clean man] upon the unclean on the [2day  1third], and on the [2day  1seventh]; and he shall be purified on the [2day  1seventh]; and he shall wash  his garments, and he shall bathe in water, and he will be unclean until evening.

20. And a man who ever should be defiled, and shall not be purified, [3shall be utterly destroyed  2soul 1that] from the midst of the congregation, for the holy things of the lord he defiled, for the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled about upon him; he is unclean.

21. And it shall be to you [2law 1an eternal]. And the one sprinkling about the water of sprinkling, he shall wash  his garments; and the one touching the water  of sprinkling, he will be unclean until evening.

22. And anything what ever should be touched by him (the one being unclean) shall be unclean until evening.  

## Numbers 20

1.  Israel Grumbles for Lack of Water And [7came 4of the 5sons 6of Israel 1all 2the 3congregation] into the wilderness of Zin, in the [2month  1first]; and [3stayed 1the 2people] in Kadesh. And [2came to an end 3there 1Miriam], and she was entombed there.

2. And there was no water for the congregation, and they gathered themselves against Moses and Aaron.

3. And [3reviled 1the 2people] against Moses, saying, Ought we died in the destruction  of our brothers before the lord.

4. And why did you lead the congregation of the lord into  this wilderness, to kill us, and  our cattle?

5. And why is this you led us from Egypt to come unto  [2place  1this bad]? A place which you cannot sow, nor is there fig-trees, nor grapevines, nor pomegranates, nor is there water to drink.

6. And [4came 1Moses 2and 3Aaron] from in front of the congregation, unto the door of the tent of the testimony, and they fell upon their face. And [4appeared 1the 2glory 3of the lord] to them.

7. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

8. Take the rod, and call an assembly of the congregation, you and Aaron  your brother! And speak to the rock before them! and it shall give  of its waters; and you shall bring forth to them water from out of the rock, and you shall give to drink the congregation and  their cattle.

9. And Moses took the rod before the lord, as the lord gave orders to him.

10. And [4held an assembly 1Moses 2and 3Aaron] of the congregation before the rock. And he said to them, Hear me! O ones resisting persuasion; must [4from out of  5this rock 1we bring forth 2to you 3water]? 

11.  Moses Strikes the Rock And Moses lifting  his hand, struck the rock with the rod twice, and came forth [2water 1much], and [3drank 1the 2congregation], and  their cattle.

12. And the lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not trust in me to sanctify me before the sons of Israel, because of this [2shall not 3bring 1you yourselves]  this congregation into the land which I have given to them.

13. This is the water of dispute, for [4were reviled 1the 2sons 3of Israel] before the lord, and he was sanctified among them.

14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying, Thus says  your brother Israel, You have knowledge of all the trouble  finding us,

15. and how [2went down  1our fathers] into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt [2days 1many], and [3inflicted evil 4on us 1the 2Egyptians] and  our fathers.

16. And we yelled out to the lord, and the lord listened to our voice. And sending an angel, he led us from out of Egypt. And now we are in Kadesh, a city of a part  of your borders.

17. We shall go through  your land. We will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor shall we drink water from out of your cistern. [3way 2by the royal 1We shall go]. We shall not turn aside to the right nor left, until whenever we should have gone by  your borders. 

18.  Edom Refuses Israel to Pass And [2said 3to 4him 1Edom], You shall not go through mine, and if otherwise, in war I shall come forth to meet with you.

19. And [4say 5to him 1the 2sons 3of Israel], [2by 3the 4mountain 1We shall go]. And if  [2of your water 1we drink], both I and  my cattle, I will give the value of it to you. But the thing is nothing, [2by 3the 4mountain 1we shall go].

20.  And he said, You shall not go through of mine. And Edom came forth to meet with him with [2multitude 1a heavy], and with [2hand 1a strong].

21. And [2did not 3want 1Edom] to give permission  to Israel to go through  his borders. And Israel turned aside from him.

22. And they departed from Kadesh. And [4came 1the 2sons 3of Israel], all the congregation, unto Hor the mountain.

23. And the lord said to Moses and Aaron in Hor, in the mountain, upon the borders of the land of Edom, saying,

24. Let Aaron be added to  his people, for in no way should he enter into the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you provoked me at the Water  of Dispute.

25. Take  Aaron and Eleazar  his son, and haul them unto Hor the mountain!

26. And take off of Aaron  his apparel, and put it on Eleazar  his son! And Aaron, having been added to his people, let him die there!

27. And Moses did as the lord gave orders to him, and he hauled them unto Hor the mountain before all the congregation. 

28.  Death of Aaron And Moses stripped off  Aaron  his garments, and he put them on Eleazar  his son. And Aaron died upon the top of the mountain. And [4came down 1Moses 2and 3Eleazar] from the mountain.

29. And [4saw 1all 2the 3congregation] that Aaron was loosed, and [4wept for  5Aaron 6thirty 7days 1all 2the house 3of Israel].  

## Numbers 21

1.  The Canaanites War with Israel And [5heard 3the 4Canaanite 1king 2Arad], the one dwelling by the wilderness, that Israel came by the way to Atharin; and he waged war against Israel, and they carried away captive some of them into captivity.

2. And Israel vowed a vow to the lord, and said, If you should deliver up to me  this people under my hand, I will devote him to consumption and  his cities.

3. And the lord listened to the voice of Israel, and he delivered up the Canaanite unto his hand, and he devoted him to consumption, and  his cities. And they called the name  of that place, Anathema.

4. And departing from Hor the mountain, by way unto the [2sea 1red], they encircled the land of Edom, and [3became faint-hearted 1the 2people] in the way.

5. And [3spoke ill 1the 2people] against  God, and against Moses, saying, Why did you lead us out of Egypt to kill us in the wilderness? For there is no bread nor water;  and our soul loathes in  [2bread  1this empty]. 

6.  The Serpent of Brass And the lord sent to the people the serpents, the ones causing death; and they bit the people, and [3died 2people 1many] of the sons of Israel.

7. And [3came 1the 2people] to Moses, saying that, We sinned, for we spoke ill against the lord, and against you; make a vow then to the lord that he remove from us the serpent! And Moses made a vow for the people.

8. And the lord said to Moses, Make to yourself a serpent of brass, and put it upon a sign. And all  having been bitten, beholding it, shall live.

9. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a sign. And it came to pass whenever [2bit 1a serpent] a man, and he looked upon the serpent  of brass, that he lived.

10. And [4departed 1the 2sons 3of Israel], and they camped in Oboth.

11. And lifting away from Oboth, they camped in Ije-abarim in the wilderness, which is against the face of Moab according to the east of the sun.

12. From there they departed and camped at the Ravine of Zared.

13. From there departing they camped in the other side of Arnon, in the wilderness  protruding from the borders of the Amorites. [3is 1For 2Arnon] the boundary of Moab between Moab and the Amorite.

14. On account of this it says in the [2scroll 1war] of the lord,  Zoob set ablaze, and the rushing streams of Arnon.

15. And [2the 3rushing streams 1he established] to settle Ar, and it lies near to the boundaries of Moab.

16. And from there they came to The Well. This is the well which the lord said to Moses, Gather together the people, and I will give to them water.

17. Then Israel sang  this song at The Well, Take the lead to him, O Well;

18. [2dug 3it 1rulers]; [3quarried 1kings 2of nations] in  their kingdoms, in  their dominating. And from Well they went unto Mattanah.

19. And from Mattanah to Nahaliel. And from Nahaliel to Bamoth. And from Bamoth to Janen which is in the plain of Moab, seen from the top of the dressing of the stone -- the place looking down at the face of the wilderness.

20. And Israel sent ambassadors to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

21. We shall go through  your land; we will not turn aside, neither into a field, nor into a vineyard;

22. nor shall we drink water from out of your well. [3way 2the royal 1We will go by], until whenever we pass by  your borders.

23. And [2did not 3give permission 1Sihon] to Israel to go through  his borders. And Sihon gathered together all  his people, and came forth to deploy against Israel in the wilderness. And he came unto Jahaz, and deployed against Israel. 

24.  Israel Takes Heshbon And [2struck 3him 1Israel] with a carnage of the sword; and they dominated  his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, unto the sons of Ammon. For Jazer [2the boundaries 3of the sons 4of Ammon 1is].

25. And Israel took all  these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the ones falling in with it.

26. [3is 1For 2Heshbon] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites. And this one waged war against the king of Moab  formerly. And they took all  his land from his hand unto Arnon.

27. On account of this [3say 1the 2ones speaking enigmas], Come into Heshbon, for [3should have been built 4and 5should have been carefully prepared 1the city 2of Sihon];

28. for fire came forth from out of Heshbon, a flame from out of the city of Sihon, and it devoured unto Moab, and swallowed down the monuments of Arnon.

29. Woe to you Moab. You are destroyed people of Chemosh. [2were rendered over  1Their sons] to be preserved, and  their daughters captives to the king of the Amorites -- Sihon.

30. And  their seed shall perish -- Heshbon unto Dibon. And  their women still burn a fire over Moab.

31. And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to survey  Jaazer, and they overtook it, and  her towns, and they cast out the Amorite  dwelling there.

33. And having turned they ascended the way  unto Bashan. And came forth Og king  of Bashan to meet with them, and all  his people for war in Edrei.

34. And the lord said to Moses, Do not fear him, for into  your hands I have delivered him, and all  his people, and all  his land; and you shall do to him as you did  to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon.

35. And he struck him and  his sons, and all  his people, until there was not any of his being left behind for taking alive; and they inherited  his land.  

## Numbers 22

1.  Balak Sends for Balaam to Curse Israel And departing, the sons of Israel camped upon the descent of Moab by the Jordan near Jericho.

2. And [4was seeing 1Balak 2son 3of Zippor] all as many things as Israel did to the Amorites.

3. And Moab feared the people exceedingly, for they were many. And Moab loathed of the face of the sons of Israel.

4. And Moab said to the council of elders of Midian, Now [2shall lick up  1this congregation] all the ones round about us, as [3licks up 1the 2calf] the green grass from the plain. And Balak son of Zippor [2king 3of Moab 1was] at  that time.

5. And he sent ambassadors to Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor, which is upon the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people have come forth from out of Egypt. And behold, it covers up the appearance of the earth, and this people lie in wait next to me.

6. And now come, curse for me  this people! for [2stronger than me 1it is]. If we should be able to strike at them, then I will cast them from out of the land. For I know that whom ever you should bless, they are blessed; and whom ever you should curse, they are cursed.

7. And [4went 1the 2council of elders 3of Moab], and the council of elders of Midian, with the oracles in  their hands. And they came to Balaam, and they spoke to him the words of Balak.

8. And he said to them, You rest up here the night, and I will answer you the things which ever the lord should speak to me! And [4stayed 1the 2rulers 3of Moab] with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam, and he said to him, What do  these men want with you?

10. And Balaam said to  God, Balak son of Zippor king of Moab sent them to me, saying,

11. Behold, a people come forth from out of Egypt, and covered the appearance of the earth, and now come curse it for me! if it is so I shall be able to strike it, and I will cast it out.

12. And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them, nor shall you curse the people; for they are blessed.

13. And Balaam rising in the morning, said to the rulers of Balak, You run to  your land, [2does not 3allow 4me 1the lord] to go with you.

14. And rising, the rulers of Moab came to Balak. And they said, [2does not 3want 1Balaam] to go with us.

15. And [2added 3again 1Balak] to send [2rulers 1many], and ones more important than these.

16. And they came to Balaam, and they say to him, Thus says Balak the son  of Zippor, I deem you worthy, you should not be reluctant to come to me,

17. for highly valued I will esteem you, and as many things as you should say to me I will do for you. Now come, accurse for me  this people!

18. And Balaam answered and said to the rulers of Balak, If [2shall give 3to me 1Balak 6full  5house 4his] of silver and gold, I shall not be able to violate the word of the lord  God, to do it small or great.

19. And now remain behind here, even you  this night! and I will know what the lord shall add to speak to me.

20. And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If [2calling 3you 4are at hand  1these men], rising up you follow them, but the saying which ever I speak to you, this you observe!

21. And Balaam rising in the morning, saddled  his donkey, and went with the rulers of Moab. 

22.  The Angel Opposes Balaam And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage  1God] that he himself went. And [4rose up 1the 2angel  3of God] in the way to stand in the way as an adversary against him. And he mounted upon  his donkey, and [2two 3servants 1his] with him.

23. And [3seeing 1the 2donkey] the angel  of God opposing it in the way, and the broadsword being unsheathed in  his hand, that [3turned aside 1the 2donkey] from the way, and went into the plain. And he struck the donkey  to straighten it in the way.

24. And [4stood 1the 2angel  3of God] in the furrows of the grapevines, a barrier here on this side and a barrier here on that side.

25. And [3seeing 1the 2donkey] the angel  of God, pressed herself against the wall, and it squeezed the foot of Balaam to the wall, and he added again to crack the whip on her.

26. And [4proceeded 1the 2angel  3of God] going forth. And he stood in [2place 1a narrow] for which there was no turning aside right or left.

27. And [3seeing 1the 2donkey] the angel  of God, sat down underneath Balaam. And Balaam became enraged, and beat the donkey with the rod.

28. And God opened the mouth of the donkey, and she says  to Balaam, What did I do to you that you have hit me this third time?

29. And Balaam said to the donkey that, You have mocked me, and if I had a sword in  my hand, already I would have stabbed you.

30. And [3says 1the 2donkey]  to Balaam, Am I not  your donkey, upon which you mounted from your youth, until  today's day? Have [2to neglect 3by overlooking 1I acted] you thus? And he said, No!

31. [3uncovered 1And  2God] the eyes of Balaam, and he sees the angel of the lord opposing him in the way, and the sword being unsheathed in  his hand. And bowing he did obeisance  on his face.

32. And [4said 5to him 1the 2angel  3of God], Why do you strike  your donkey this third time? Now behold, I came forth to distract you, for [2was not 3fair  1your way] before me.

33. And seeing me, the donkey turned aside from me this third time; and unless she turned aside from me, now then you indeed I would have killed, [4her 1and 2then 3I would have preserved].

34. And Balaam said to the angel of the lord, I have sinned, for I did not have knowledge that you opposed me in the way to meet with me. And now, unless it not be sufficient to you, I shall return.

35. And [4said 1the 2angel  3of God] to Balaam, You go with the men! Except the word which ever I should say to you, this you shall guard to speak. And Balaam went with the rulers of Balak.

36. And Balak hearing that Balaam had came, came forth to meet him in a city of Moab, which is upon the borders of Arnon, which is of the parts of the borders.

37. And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send to you to call you? Why have you not come to me? Really, shall I not be able to esteem you?

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I come to you now. Am I able to speak anything? The word which ever God should put into  my mouth, this I will speak.

39. And Balaam went with Balak. And they came to Cities of Properties.

40. And Balak sacrificed sheep and calves, and sent to Balaam and to the rulers, to the ones with him.

41. And it became morning, and Balak taking  Balaam transported him unto the stele  of Baal, and showed to him from there a certain part of the people.  

## Numbers 23

1.  Balaam's Parable And Balaam said  to Balak, Build for me here seven shrines, and prepare for me here seven calves, and seven rams!

2. And Balak did in which manner [2said 3to him 1Balaam]. And he offered a calf and ram upon the shrine.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, You stand beside  your sacrifice! and I shall go and see if [5me 2shall appear  1God 3to 4meet with]. And the saying which ever he shall show to me I shall announce to you. And he went straight.

4. And God appeared  to Balaam. And [2said 3to 4him 1Balaam], The seven shrines I prepared, and I brought a calf and ram unto the shrine.

5. And God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, and he said, Turning towards Balak thus you shall speak.

6. And he returned to him, and thus he stood over  his whole burnt-offerings, and all the rulers of Moab with him.

7. And taking up  his parable, he said, From out of Mesopotamia [4fetched 5me 1Balak 2king 3of Moab], out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come curse for me  Jacob! and, Come accurse to me  Israel!

8. How shall I curse whom [2does not 3curse 1the lord]? And how shall I imprecate maledictions upon whom [2does not 3imprecate maledictions upon  1God]?

9. For from the top of mountains I shall see him; and from hills I shall pay attention to him. Behold, a people [2alone 1shall dwell], and among nations they shall not be reckoned together.

10. Who determined exactly the seed of Jacob, and who shall count out peoples of Israel? May [2die  1my soul] among souls of the just, and may [2become  1my seed] as the seed of this.

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? For a curse for my enemies I have called you, and behold, you have blessed a blessing.

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Is it not as many things as God should put in  my mouth this I will guard to speak?

13. And [2said 3to 4him 1Balak], Come yet with me to [2place 1another] of which you shall not see it from there, but only a certain part of it shall you see, [4all 1but 2in no way 3should you see], and you curse it for me from there!

14. And he took him into a field -- a height upon the top of a place for dressing stone; and he built there seven shrines, and brought a calf and ram unto the shrine.

15. And Balaam said to Balak, Stand beside  your sacrifice! and I shall go to ask  God.

16. And God met with  Balaam, and he put a word into  his mouth. And said, Return to Balak! and thus you shall speak.

17. And he returned to him. And thus he was standing beside  his whole burnt-offering, and the rulers of Moab with him. And [2said 3to him 1Balak], What said the lord?

18. And taking up  his parable, he said, Rise up, O Balak, and hear! Give ear, O witness son of Zippor!

19. [2is not 3as 4a man  1God] to waver, nor as a son of man to be threatened. He in speaking, shall he not do? Shall he speak, and not adhere to?

20. Behold, [2to bless 1I have taken to myself]. I will bless and in no way shall I turn back.

21. There shall not be trouble in Jacob, nor shall [2appear 1misery] in Israel. The lord  his God is with him, the honorable ones of the rulers are with him.

22. God was the one leading him out of Egypt; as the glory of his unicorn.

23. [3no 1For 2there is] omen in Jacob, nor divination in Israel. In time it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what [2shall complete  1God].

24. Behold, the people as a cub shall raise up, and as a lion it shall prance; It shall not go to sleep until it shall eat game, and the blood of the slain it shall drink.

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Neither in curses shall you curse him, nor blessings shall you bless him.

26. And Balaam answering said  to Balak, Did I not speak to you, saying, The word which ever God should speak, this I will do?

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I should take you unto [2place 1another], if it should please  God, and curse him for me from there!

28. And Balak took  Balaam upon the top  of Peor, the part extending into the wilderness.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven shrines, and prepare for me here seven calves, and seven rams!

30. And Balak did just as [2said 3to him 1Balaam], and he bore a calf and a ram unto the shrine.  

## Numbers 24

1.  Balaam Blesses Israel And Balaam seeing that it is good before the lord to bless  Israel, he did not go according to the accustomed way to meet with the ones with omens; and he turned back  his face to the wilderness.

2. And Balaam lifting up  his eyes, looks down  on Israel encamped by tribes. And [3became 1spirit 2of God] upon him.

3. And taking up  his parable, he said, Says Balaam son of Beor. Says the man [2true 1seeing].

4. Says the one hearing oracles of God, who [2a vision 3of God 1saw] in sleep; uncovering  his eyes.

5. How good  are your houses, O Jacob,  your tents, O Israel.

6. As groves shadowing, as parks near a river, and as tents which the lord pitched, as cedars by waters.

7. [2came forth 1A man] from out of  his seed, and he shall dominate [2nations 1many]. And [3shall be raised up high  1Gog 2his kingdom], and [2shall be increased 1his kingdom].

8.  God guided him from out of Egypt; as the glory of a unicorn to him. He shall eat the nations of his enemies, and  [2of their thickness 1he will extract the marrow], and with his arrows he shall shoot an enemy.

9. Lying down he rested as a lion, and as a cub who shall raise him? The ones blessing you, they are blessed; and the ones cursing you, they are cursed.

10. And Balak was enraged at Balaam, and he struck together  his hands. And Balak said to Balaam, To imprecate maledictions upon  my enemy I have called you, and behold, blessing you blessed this third time.

11. Now then, flee unto  your place! I said I will esteem you, but now [2deprived 3you 1the lord] of the glory.

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also [2to 3your messengers 4whom 5you sent 6to 7me 1speak], saying,

13. If [3to me 2should give 1Balak 5full  4his house] of silver and gold, I shall not be able to violate the word of the lord, to do it good or bad by myself. As many things as [2should say 3to me  1God], these things I shall speak.

14. And now, behold, I run to  my place. Come, I will advise you what [2will do  1this people]  with your people in the last of the days.

15. And taking up  his parable, he said, Says Balaam son of Beor. Says the man  [2true 1seeing],

16. In hearing oracles of God, having knowledge of higher knowledge by the highest, and [2a vision 3of God 1seeing] in sleep, uncovering  his eyes.

17. I will show to him, but not now. I bless, and he does not approach. [2will arise 1A star] from out of Jacob, and [2shall rise up 1a man] from out of Israel, and he shall devastate the heads of Moab, and he shall despoil all of the sons of Sheth.

18. And Edom shall be an inheritance, and [3shall be 4an inheritance 1Esau  2his enemy]. And Israel acted in strength.

19. And one shall be awakened from out of Jacob, and shall destroy the one escaping from the city.

20. And having seen  Amalek, and taking up  his parable, he said, The head of nations is Amalek, and  his seed shall perish.

21. And having seen the Kenite, and taking up  his parable, he said, [2is strong  1Your dwelling], and if you should put [2in 3a rock  1your nest],

22. and if it be  to Beor a nest of astuteness, the Assyrians shall capture you.

23. And taking up  his parable, he said, Oh, Oh, who shall live whenever [2should appoint 3these things  1God]?

24. And one shall come forth from out of the hands of the Chittim, and they shall afflict Assyria, and they shall afflict Hebrews, and they with one accord shall perish.

25. And Balaam rising up went forth returning unto  his place. And Balak went forth to his own.  

## Numbers 25

1.  Israel Fornicates to Baal-peor And Israel rested up in Shittim, and [3profaned 1the 2people] to fornicate with the daughters of Moab.

2. And they called them unto the sacrifices  of their idols, and [3ate 1the 2people]  of their sacrifices, and they did obeisance to  their idols.

3. And Israel was initiated  to Baal-peor; and [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord]  with Israel.

4. And the lord said  to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and make an example of them for the lord over against the sun! and [4shall turn away 1the anger 2of the rage 3of the lord] from Israel.

5. And Moses said to the tribes of Israel, Let [2kill 1each] the one of his family  being initiated  to Baal-Peor!

6. And behold, a man of the sons of Israel coming, led forward  his brother to the Midianitish woman before Moses, and before all the congregation of the sons of Israel. And they were weeping by the door of the tent of the testimony. 

7.  Phinehas Stems the Calamity And seeing, Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, rose up from the midst of the congregation, and taking a spear in his hand,

8. he entered after the Israelitish man into the furnace, and he pierced both the  Israelitish man, and the woman through  her womb; and [3ceased 1the 2calamity] from the sons of Israel.

9. And [6were 1the 2ones having died 3by 4the 5calamity] four and twenty thousand.

10. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, caused [2to cease  1my rage] from the sons of Israel, in  my being jealous in the zeal for them; and I did not completely consume the sons of Israel in  my zeal.

12. Thus say! Behold, I make with him my covenant of peace;

13. and it will be to him and to his seed after him a covenant [2priesthood 1of an eternal], because he was jealous  for his God, and he atoned for the sons of Israel.

14. And the name of the Israelitish man  being struck, who was stricken with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri son of Salu, ruler of the house of the family of Simeon.

15. And the name of the Midianitish woman  being struck, was Cozbi, daughter of Zur, a ruler of the nation of Ommoth; [2of the house 3of the family 1it is] of the ones of Midian.

16. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the sons of Israel! saying,

17. Hate the Midianites, and strike them!

18. For [4are hating 5you 3they 1with 2deceit], with as many things they used deceit against you through Peor, even through Cozbi, daughter of the ruler of Midian, their sister, the one being struck in the day of the calamity on account of Peor.  

## Numbers 26

1.  Moses and Eleazar Number Israel And it came to pass after the calamity, and the lord spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, saying,

2. Take the sum of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, from twenty years and up, according to the houses of their patrimony! every one  going forth to deploy among Israel.

3. And [6spoke 1Moses 2and 3Eleazar 4the 5priest] with them in the wilderness of Moab at the Jordan by Jericho, saying,

10. And [3opening 1the 2earth]  its mouth swallowed them and Korah in the death  of his congregation, when [3devoured 1the 2fire] the fifty and two hundred. And they were made as a sign.

And [3sons 2no 1there were] born to him. Let [4not 5be wiped away 1the 2name  3of our father] from the midst  of his people! for there is not a son to him.

## Numbers 30

1.  Ordinances Regarding Vows And Moses spoke to the rulers of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, This is the saying which the lord ordered.

2. A man, a man who ever should vow a vow to the lord, or should swear by an oath, or should confirm a set of limits upon  his life, he shall not profane  his word; all as many things as should come forth from out of  his mouth he shall do.

3. And if [2should vow 1a woman] a vow to the lord, or confirm a set of limits in the house  of her father in  her youth;

4. and [2should hear  1her father]  her vows, and  her sets of limits which she confirmed on  her life, and [3should remain silent 1her  2father], then shall stand all the matters of her vows, and all the sets of limits which she confirmed on  her life she shall abide by.

5. But if in shaking his head in dissent [2should dissent  1her father] in which ever day he should hear  her vows, and  her sets of limits which she confirmed on  her life, then they shall not stand; and the lord shall clear her for [2shook his head in dissent  1her father].

6. But if in coming to pass she should become a man's wife, and  her vows be upon her, according to the distinction  from her lips as many things as she confirmed on  her life;

7. and [2should hear  1her husband], and should remain silent concerning her in which ever day he should hear, then thus shall stand all  her vows; and  her sets of limits which she confirmed on  her life shall stand.

8. But if in shaking his head in dissent [2should dissent  1her husband] in which ever day he should hear all  her vows, and  her sets of limits which she confirmed on  her life, they shall not abide, for  her husband shook his head in dissent concerning her, and the lord shall clear her.

9. And a vow of a widow, and a woman being cast out, as many things as she should make a vow on  her life, shall abide to her.

10. But if in the house  of her husband  her vow be, or the set of limits on  her life with an oath,

11. and [2should hear  1her husband], and remain silent concerning her, and should not shake his head in dissent concerning her, then shall stand all  her vows; and all  her sets of limits which she confirmed on  her life shall stand concerning her.

12. But if in removing [2should remove them  1her husband], in which ever day he should hear, all as many things as should come forth from out of  her lips concerning  her vows, and concerning the sets of limits  on  her life; it shall not remain to her,  her husband removed them, and the lord cleared her.

13. Every vow and every [2oath 1binding] to afflict her soul,  her husband shall set for her, and  her husband shall remove for her.

14. But if in keeping silent he should remain silent at her day by day, then [3shall stand 4to her 1all  2her vows]; and the sets of limits  upon her shall stand to her, for he kept silent at her in the day in which he heard.

15. But if removing [2should remove them  1her husband] after the day which he heard them, then he shall take the sin unto himself.

16. These are the ordinances, as many as the lord gave charge to Moses between a husband and between his wife, and between a father and daughter in youth in the house of her father.  

## Numbers 31

1.  Israel Wars with Midian And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Let [4avenge  5with punishment 1the 2sons 3of Israel] on the Midianites; and at the last you shall be added to  your people.

3. And Moses spoke to the people saying, Completely arm  your men, and deploy before the lord against Midian, to render punishment by the lord  on Midian.

4. A thousand from a tribe; even a thousand from a tribe from all of the tribes of the sons of Israel you send to deploy!

5. And they counted out from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from a tribe. Twelve thousand being armed in battle array.

6. And [2sent 3them 1Moses], a thousand from out of a tribe; even a thousand from out of a tribe with their force. And Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; and the [2items  1holy] and the trumpets were in  their hands for the signals.

7. And they deployed against Midian as the lord gave charge to Moses. And they killed every male.

11. And they took all the plunder, and all  their spoils -- from man unto beast.

12. And they brought to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to all the sons of Israel, the captivity, and the spoils, and the plunder, into the camp in the wilderness of Moab which is upon the Jordan by Jericho.

13. And Moses came forth, and Eleazar the priest, and all the rulers of the congregation to meet with them outside the camp.

14. And Moses was provoked to anger with the overseers of the force -- commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds, the ones coming from the battle array of the war.

15. And [2said 3to them 1Moses], why did you take alive every female?

16. For these were the occasion to the sons of Israel by the word of Balaam of their leaving and overlooking the word of the lord, because of Peor, and came to pass the calamity in the congregation of the lord.

17. And now kill every male among all the chattel! And every woman who knew the marriage-bed of a man kill!

18. And all the chattel of the women who have not known the marriage-bed of a man, take them alive!

19. And you camp outside the camp seven days, every one  doing away with a soul! And all  having touched the one being pierced shall be purified in the third day, and in the [2day  1seventh] you and  your captivity.

20. And every wrap-around garment, and every item made of skin, and every work of goat skin, and every [2item 1wooden], you shall purify.

21. And [4said 1Eleazar 2the 3priest] to the men of the force of the ones coming from the battle array of the war, This is the ordinance of the law which the lord gave orders to Moses.

22. Besides the gold, and the silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,

23. every thing which shall go through in fire shall be led through in fire, and shall be clean, but only with the water  of purification shall it be purified. And all as many as should not travel through fire, shall go through water.

24. And you shall wash the garments on the [2day  1seventh], and you shall be clean. And after this you shall enter into the camp. 

25.  The Spoils Divided And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Take the total sum of the spoils of the captivity, from man unto beast, you and Eleazar the priest, and the rulers of the patrimony of the congregation!

27. And you shall divide the spoils between the warriors of the ones going forth into the battle array, and between the whole congregation.

28. And you shall offer up the tax to the lord from the men of the warriors, of the ones going forth into the battle array, one soul from five hundred of the people, and from the cattle, and from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the donkeys;

29. from  their half you shall take. And you shall give to Eleazar the priest the first-fruits for the lord.

30. And from the half of the ones of the sons of Israel, you shall take one from fifty, from the people, and from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the donkeys, and from all the cattle. And you shall give them to the Levites, to the ones guarding the watches in the tent of the lord.

31. And [6did 1Moses 2and 3Eleazar 4the 5priest] as the lord gave orders to Moses.

32. And came to pass the surplus of the plunder which [4despoiled  3men 1the 2warrior] from the sheep -- six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand;

33. and oxen -- two and seventy thousand;

34. and donkeys -- one and sixty thousand.

35. And the souls of people from the women who did not know the marriage-bed of a male, all souls -- two and thirty thousand.

36. And came to pass the half  portion of the ones going forth into the war, of the number of the sheep -- three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred.

38. and oxen -- six and thirty thousand; and  their tax to the lord -- two and seventy;

39. and donkeys -- thirty thousand and five hundred; and  their tax to the lord -- one and sixty.

40. And the souls of people -- six and ten thousand; and  their tax to the lord -- two and thirty souls.

41. And Moses gave the tax to the lord, the cut-away portion  of God, to Eleazar the priest as the lord gave orders to Moses,

42. of the half of the sons of Israel whom Moses divided from the [2men  1warrior].

43. And came to pass the half from the congregation, of the sheep -- three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred;

44. and oxen -- six and thirty thousand;

45. donkeys -- thirty thousand and five hundred;

46. and souls of peoples -- six and ten thousand.

47. And Moses took from the half of the sons of Israel, the one from every  fifty of the people, and of the cattle; and he gave them to the Levites  guarding the watches of the tent of the lord, in which manner the lord gave orders to Moses.

48. And there came forward to Moses all the ones placed as the commanders of the force -- commanders of thousands, and commanders of hundreds. And they said to Moses,

49.  Your servants have taken the total sum of the [2men  1warrior], of the ones with us, and not dissented of them not even one.

50. And we have brought the gift to the lord, every man who found an item of gold, and armlet, and bracelet, and ring, and right armband, and wreath, to atone for us before the lord.

51. And [6took 1Moses 2and 3Eleazar 4the 5priest] the gold from them, every item being worked.

52. And came to pass all the gold for the cut-away portion which they removed to the lord -- sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels from the commanders of thousands, and from the commanders of hundreds.

53. And the [2men  1warrior] despoiled each unto himself.

54. And [6took 1Moses 2and 3Eleazar 4the 5priest] the gold from the commanders of a thousand, and from the commanders of hundreds, and carried them into the tent of the testimony, a memorial of the sons of Israel before the lord.  

## Numbers 32

1.  Reuben and Gad Claim their Land And [3of cattle 2a multitude 1there was] to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, [3multitude 2great 1an exceedingly]. And they saw the place of Jazer, and the place of Gilead; and [3was 1the 2place] a place of cattle.

2. And [4coming forward 1the 2sons 3of Reuben], and the sons of Gad, said to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the rulers of the congregation, saying,

3. Ataroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah and Heshbon and Elealeh and Shebam and Nebo and Beon,

4. the land which the lord delivered up before the sons of Israel, [2land 3for grazing cattle 1is], and  your servants [2on cattle 1subsist].

5. And they said, If we find favor before you, give  this land to your servants for a possession, and do not cause us to pass over the Jordan!

6. And Moses said to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben,  [2your brethren 1Shall] go to  war and you sit here?

7. And why do you turn aside the thoughts of the sons of Israel to not pass over into the land which the lord gives to them?

8. Did not [2do thus  1your fathers] when I sent them from out of Kadesh Barnea to study the land?

9. And they ascended the Ravine of the Cluster, and studied the land, and separated the heart of the sons of Israel, so as to not enter into the land which [2gave 3to them 1the lord].

10. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] in  that day, and swore by an oath, saying,

11. Shall [2see  1these men] (the men ascending from Egypt, from twenty years old and up, the ones having knowledge of the good and the bad) the land which I swore by an oath to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, no. For they did not follow together after me,

12. except Caleb son of Jephunneh, the one being set apart, and Joshua the son of Nun, for he followed after the lord.

13. And [2was provoked to anger 3in rage 1the lord] over  Israel; and he staggered them in the wilderness forty years, until [8was completely consumed 1all 2the 3generation  4doing  5evil 6before 7the lord].

14. Behold, you rose up in place of  your fathers, a confederation of men of sinners to add still unto the rage of the anger of the lord against  Israel,

15. that you shall turn away from him to add still to leave him in the wilderness, and shall act lawlessly against [2entire  3congregation 1this].

16. And they came forward to him, and said, Properties for flocks we shall build here for our cattle, and cities for our chattel.

17. And we, arming ourselves, will be an advance guard in front of the sons of Israel, until when we should lead them into  their own place. And [2shall dwell  1our belongings] in cities being walled, because of the ones dwelling in the land.

18. In no way should we return to  our dwellings, until whenever [5should divide 1the 2sons 3of Israel 4each] into  his inheritance.

19. And no longer shall we be heir with them from the other side of the Jordan, and beyond; because we receive  our lots on the other side of the Jordan  eastwards.

20. And [2said 3to 4them 1Moses], If you should do according to  this thing, if you should completely arm before the lord for war,

21. and [3shall go over 1you yourselves 2all 6armed with large shields 4the 5Jordan] before the lord, until [2shall be obliterated  1his enemy] from his face,

22. and [3shall be dominated 1the 2land] before the lord, then after these things you shall return, and you will be innocent before the lord, and from Israel. And [2shall be  1this land] to you for a possession before the lord.

23. But if you should not do so, you shall sin before the lord; and you shall know  your sin, whenever [2should overtake you  1bad things].

24. And thus you shall build to yourselves for them cities  for your belongings, and properties  for your cattle; and the thing going forth from out of  your mouth you shall do.

25. And [8spoke 1the 2sons 3of Reuben 4and 5the 6the sons 7of Gad] to Moses, saying,  Your servants shall do as  our master gives charge.

26.  Our belongings, and  our women, and  our possessions, and all  our cattle will be there in the cities of Gilead.

27.  And your servants shall all go over, being armed and being arrayed before the lord for  war, in which manner the master says.

28. And [2stood together with them 1Moses], with Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the rulers of the patrimony of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

29. And [2said 3to 4them 1Moses], If [8should pass over 1the 2sons 3of Reuben 4and 5the 6sons 7of Gad] [3with 4you 1the 2Jordan], every one being armed for war before the lord, and you should dominate the land before you, then you shall give to them the land of Gilead for a possession.

30. But if they should not pass over being armed with you for  war before the lord, then you shall cause [2to pass over 3with their 4belongings 1them], and  their women, and  their cattle in front of you into the land of Canaan; and they shall inherit together with you in the land of Canaan.

31. And [8answered 1the 2sons 3of Reuben 4and 5the 6sons 7of Gad], saying, As much as the lord says to his attendants, so we shall do.

32. We will pass over being armed before the lord into the land of Canaan. And you shall give  our possession on the other side of the Jordan. 

33.  Moses Distributes Land And [2gave 3to them 1Moses], to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half tribe of Manasseh of the sons of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and the cities with  its boundaries -- the cities of the land round about.

34. And [4built 1the 2sons 3of Gad]  Dibon, and  Ataroth, and  Aroer,

35. and  Shophan, and  Jaazer. And they raised them up,

36. and  Beth-nimrah, and  Beth-haran -- [2cities 1fortified], and properties of flocks.

37. And the sons of Reuben built  Heshbon, and  Elealeh, and  Kirjathaim,

38. and  Nebo and  Baal-meon, being surrounded with walls, and  Shibmah. And they named by  their names the names of the cities which they built.

39. And [5went 1a son 2of Machir 3son 4of Manasseh] into Gilead, and took it, and destroyed the Amorite  dwelling in it.

40. And Moses gave  Gilead  to Machir son of Manasseh; and he dwelt there.

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went, and he took  their properties, and named them Properties of Jair.

42. And Nobah went and took  Kenath, and  her towns, and named them Nobah, after  his name.

## Numbers 35

1.  The Lots of the Levites And the lord spoke to Moses upon the descent of Moab, by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying,

2. Give orders to the sons of Israel! and they shall give to the Levites from the lots of their possession cities to dwell in; and the outskirts of the cities round about them you shall give to the Levites.

3. And [3shall be 1the 2cities] to dwell in. And  their separation offerings of lands will be for their cattle and all  their four-footed animals.

4. And the lands falling in with the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outside -- a thousand cubits round about.

5. And you shall measure outside the city -- the side the one towards the east -- two thousand cubits; and the side the one towards the south -- two thousand cubits; and the side the one towards the west -- two thousand cubits; and the side the one towards the north -- two thousand cubits; and the city between this will be for you, and the adjoining areas of the cities. 

6.  Cities of Refuge And the cities which you shall give to the Levites are the six cities of the places of refuge, which you shall give [3to flee 4there 1for the 2one man-slaying]; and in addition to these, forty  two cities.

7. All the cities which you shall give to the Levites are forty and eight cities, these and  their outskirts.

8. And the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, from the ones having  many will be many; and from the ones having less will be less; each according to  his inheritance which they shall allot, they shall give from the cities to the Levites.

9. And the lord spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel! and you shall say to them, You are passing over the Jordan into the land of Canaan.

11. And you shall draw apart to you for them cities for them; [2places of refuge 1they will be] to you [3to flee 4there 1for the 2man-slayer]; any one  striking a soul unintentionally.

12. And they will be  cities for you as places of refuge from the one acting as next of kin  for blood, that in no way should [3die 1the one 2man-slaying] until whenever he should stand before the congregation for judgment.

13. And the cities which you shall appoint -- the six cities -- [2places of refuge 1will be] for you.

14.  Three cities you shall appoint on the other side of the Jordan, and  three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan.

15. A place of refuge they will be to the sons of Israel. And to the foreigner and to the sojourner  among you [2will be  1these cities] for a place of refuge to flee there to all striking a soul unintentionally.

16. And if by an item of iron one should strike him, and he should come to an end -- that one is a murderer -- unto death let [3be put to death 1the 2murderer]!

17. And if by a stone from the hand in which one should die by it, then the one who should strike him, even he should die, he is a murderer -- unto death let [3be put to death 1the 2murderer]!

18. And if by an item of wood from his hand of which one should die, as he should strike him, and one should die, he is a murderer -- unto death [3shall die 1the 2murderer]!

19. The one acting as next of kin  for blood, this one shall kill the one man-slaying; whenever he meets him, this one shall kill him.

20. And if through hatred he should thrust him through or should cast upon him any item by ambush, and he should die,

21. or through vehement anger he strikes him by the hand, and he should die -- to death let [3be put to death 1the one 2striking], he is a murderer! The one acting as next of kin for blood shall kill the one man-slaying in the meeting up with him.

22. But if suddenly, [2not 3by 4hatred 1he should thrust him through], or cast upon him any item, not from ambush,

23. or any stone in which he shall die by it, not knowing, and he should fall upon him, and he should die, but he [2not 3his enemy 1was], nor seeking to do evil against him;

24. then [3shall judge 1the 2congregation] between the one striking and between the one acting as next of kin  for blood, according to  these cases.

25. And [3shall rescue 1the 2congregation] the one man-slaying from the one acting as next of kin  for blood; and [3shall restore 4him 1the 2congregation] into the city  of his place of refuge, of which he took refuge; and he shall dwell there until whenever [4should die 1the 3priest  2great], whom they anointed him  [3oil 1with the 2holy].

26. But if by an exit [3should come forth from 1the one 2man-slaying] the borders of the city in which he took refuge there,

27. and [4should find 5him 1the one 2acting as next of kin  3for blood] outside the borders of the city of his refuge, and [4should slaughter 1the one 2acting as next of kin  3for blood] the one man-slaying, [2not 3liable 1is he]?

28. For in the city  of his refuge let him dwell until [4should die  3priest 1the 2great]! And after the dying of the [2priest  1great] [3will be able to return 1the one 2man-slaying] unto the land  of his possession.

29. And these things will be to you for an ordinance of judgment unto  your generations in all  your dwellings.

30. Every one striking a soul, with witnesses, you shall slaughter the one man-slaying; and [2witness 1one] shall not witness for a soul to die.

31. And you shall not take ransoms for a soul from the one murdering -- the [2liable 1one being] is to be done away with, for unto death he shall be put to death.

32. And you shall not take ransoms for the one fleeing into a city of the places of refuge,  to again dwell in the land, until whenever [4should die 1the 3priest  2great].

33. And in no way should you pollute with murder the land upon which you dwell upon it;  for this blood pollutes [3by murder 1the 2land], and [3shall not 4be atoned 1the 2land] from the blood  having been poured out upon it, but it shall be upon the blood of the one pouring it out.

34. And you shall not defile the land upon which you dwell upon it, of which I should encamp among you. For I am the lord encamping in the midst of the sons of Israel.  

## Numbers 36

1.  The Transfer of Tribal Lands And came forward the rulers of the fathers' side of the tribes of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the tribe of the sons of Joseph, and they spoke before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the rulers of the houses of the patrimony of the sons of Israel.

2. And they said, [2to 3our master 1The lord gave charge] to give the land  of inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel; and [2to the 3master 1the lord gave orders] to give the inheritance of Zelophehad  our brother to his daughters.

3. And they will be to one of the tribes of the sons of Israel for wives; and [2shall be removed  1their lot] from the possession  of our fathers, and shall be added for an inheritance of the tribe in which ever they should become wives; and from the lot  of our inheritance it shall be removed.

4. And if there should be the release of the sons of Israel, then [2shall be added  1their inheritance] unto the inheritance of the tribe in which ever [2become wives 1the women]; and from the inheritance of the tribe of our family [2shall be removed  1their inheritance].

5. And Moses gave charge to the sons of Israel, through the order of the lord, saying, Thus to the tribe of the sons of Israel, say,

6. This is the saying which the lord ordered to the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Of whom ever it is pleasing before them 1let them be wives, only from the people  of their father let them be wives!

7. And [6shall not 7be moved around 1the 2inheritance 3to the 4sons 5of Israel] from tribe to tribe, that each in the inheritance of the tribe  of his family [4shall cleave to 1the 2sons 3of Israel].

8. And every daughter acting as next of kin of an inheritance from the tribes of the sons of Israel, [3to one 4of the ones 5from out of 6the 7people  8of her father 1they shall be 2wives], that [4should be acting as next of kin 1the 2sons 3of Israel], each in the inheritance  of his father.
