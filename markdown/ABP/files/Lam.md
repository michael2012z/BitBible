# Lamentations

## Lamentations 1

1.  Jeremiah Wails Over Jerusalem And it came to pass after  [2was taken captive  1Israel], and Jerusalem was made desolate, Jeremiah sat down weeping, and he wailed  this lamentation over Jerusalem, and he said, ΑΛΕΦ How does [5sit 6alone 1the 2city  3being filled 4with peoples]; she became as a widow, becoming filled among the nations; ruling in the regions, she became for tribute.

2. ΒΗΘ In weeping, she wept in the night, and  her tears are upon  her cheeks, and no one existed  comforting her from all of the ones loving her. All the ones being fond of her discarded  her, they became to her for enemies.

3. ΓΙΜΑΛ Judea was displaced because of her humiliation, and because of the multitude of her servitude. She stays among the nations, she did not find rest. All the ones pursuing her overtook her in the midst of the ones afflicting.

4. ΔΑΛΕΘ The ways of Zion mourn by reason of  there not being ones coming to the holiday feast. All  her gates have been obliterated.  Her priests are groaning,  her virgins are being led captive, and she is being embittered in herself.

5. Η [4became 1The ones 2afflicting 3her]  the head, and  her enemies are straightened; for the lord humbled her over the multitude  of her impieties.  Her infants went into captivity in front of the one afflicting.

6. ΟΥΑΥ And went forth from the daughter of Zion all  her beauty. [2became  1Her rulers] as rams not finding pasture, and going with no strength in front of the one pursuing.

7. ΖΑΙΝ Jerusalem remembered the days of her humiliation, and her repulsions. All  her desirable things, as many as were from [2days 1ancient] during the falling  of her people into the hands of the one afflicting, and there was no one  helping her. Seeing,  her enemies laughed upon  her displacement.

8. ΗΘ [3a sin 2sinned 1Jerusalem]; on account of this [2for 3tossing about 1she became]. All the ones glorifying her humbled her, for they beheld  her indecency. And indeed she is moaning herself and turns to the rear.

9. ΤΗΘ Her uncleanness is before her feet, she did not remember her end, and she brought down enormously. There is no  comforting her. Behold O lord  my humiliation, for [3was magnified 1the 2enemy]!

10. ΙΩΘ [3his hand 4spread forth 1The one 2afflicting] upon all the desirable things of hers. For she saw nations entering into  her sanctuary -- the ones which I charged [2not 3to enter 1them] into your assembly.

11. ΧΑΦ All  her people are groaning seeking bread. They gave the desirable things of hers for food  to restore their soul. Behold, O lord, and look upon! for she became as one being disgraced.

12. ΛΑΜΕΔ [2the ones 4to 5you 1All 3coming near] in the way turn and see if there is a pain as my pain which happened to me. The one uttering a sound to me humbled me -- the lord in a day of anger of his rage.

13. ΜΗΜ From out of his height he sent fire in  my bones, and he led it down. He opened and spread out a net  for my feet. He turned me to the rear. He appointed me for being removed from view; an entire  day for grieving.

14. ΝΟΥΝ He was vigilant concerning  my acts of impiety; [2in 3my hands 1they are closely joined]; they ascended unto  my neck. [2is weakened  1My strength], for the lord put [2in 3my hands 1griefs]; I shall not be able to stand.

15. ΣΑΜΕΧ [3lifted away 4all  5my strong men 1The 2 lord] from the midst of me. He called upon me a time  to break my choice men. [3the wine vat 2trod 1The lord] for the virgin daughter of Judah.

16. ΑΙΝ Over these things I weep;  my eye led down water, For far from me is the one comforting me, the one restoring my soul. [3were  2sons 1My] obliterated, for [3conquered 1the 2enemy].

17. ΦΗ Zion opened and spread out her hands; there is no one  comforting her. The lord gave charge to Jacob; round about him are the ones afflicting him. Jerusalem was as a woman sitting apart unclean in the midst of them.

18. ΣΑΔΗ [3just 2is 1The lord]; for  [2his mouth 1I greatly embittered]. Hear indeed all  peoples, and behold  my pain! My virgins and my young men were gone into captivity.

19. ΚΩΦ I called  my lovers, but they misled me.  My priests and  my elders [2in 3the 4city 1failed], for they sought food for themselves, that they should restore their lives.

20. ΡΗΣ Behold, O lord, for I am afflicted!  My belly was disturbed, and  my heart was turned within me; greatly embittering I was embittered. Outside [2made me childless 1the sword], as if a death in the house.

21. ΣΙΝ Hear indeed! for I moan. There is not  one comforting me. All  my enemies heard the bad things concerning me, and they rejoice that you did it. You brought on the day; you called the time, they became alike to me.

22. ΘΑΥ May [3enter 1all  2their evils] before your face. And glean them! in which manner they made a gleaning for all  of my sins. for [2are many  1my moanings], and  my heart frets.  

## Lamentations 2

1.  The LORD Destroys Israel and Judah ΑΛΕΦ O How [2darkened 3his anger 1the lord] for the daughter of Zion. He hurled down from out of heaven unto the earth the glory of Israel, and he remembered not the stool of his feet in a day of wrath of his rage.

2. ΒΗΘ [2sunk 1the lord], not sparing, all the beautiful things of Jacob. He demolished in his rage the fortresses of the daughter of Judah. He cleaved unto the ground. He profaned her king and her ruler.

3. ΓΙΜΕΛ He broke in pieces in anger of his rage all the horn of Israel. He turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and he lit in Jacob [2as 3fire 1a flame], and it devoured all the things round about.

4. ΔΑΛΕΘ He stretched tight his bow as an enemy. He stiffened his right hand as an opponent, and he killed all the desirable things  of my eyes in the tent of the daughter of Zion. He poured out [2as 3fire  1his anger].

5. Η [2became 1The lord] as an enemy. He sunk Israel, he sunk all  his palaces. He utterly destroyed  his fortresses, and multiplied to the daughter of Judah the one humbling and the one being humbled.

6. ΟΥΑΥ And he opened and spread out [2as 3a grapevine  1his tent]. [2was corrupted 1his holiday feast]. The lord forgot what he appointed in Zion -- the holiday feast and the Sabbath; and [3provoked 1the threatening 2of his anger] king and priest.

7. ΖΑΙΝ The lord thrust away his altar, he brushed off his sanctuary, he broke by the hand of the enemy the wall of her palaces; [2a sound 1they gave] in the house of the lord, as in the day of holiday.

8. ΗΘ The lord devised  to ruin the wall of the daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measure, he did not return his hand from trampling; and [3mourned 1the 2area around the wall], and the wall with one accord was weakened.

9. ΤΗΘ [2are stuck 3into 4the ground 1Her gates]; he destroyed and broke her gate bars. Her king and her rulers are in the nations. There is no law, and indeed her prophets beheld not a vision by the lord.

10. ΙΩΘ They sat upon the ground; [4kept silent 1the elders 2of the daughter 3of Zion]. They brought dust upon  their head; they girded on sackcloths; they led down to the ground the heads of virgins in Jerusalem.

11. ΧΑΦ [2failed 3with 4tears  1My eyes]; [2is disturbed  1my heart]; [2is poured out 3onto 4the 5ground  1my glory] over the destruction of the daughter  of my people, in the failing infant and ones nursing in the squares of the city.

12. ΛΑΜΕΔ  To their mothers they said, Where is the grain and wine? while they were enfeebled as wounded men in the squares of the city, in the pouring out of their souls into the bosom of their mothers.

13. ΜΗΜ What shall I testify? or what shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? Who shall deliver you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For [3was enlarged 1the cup 2of your destruction]; Who shall heal you?

14. ΝΟΥΝ Your prophets saw for you vanities and folly, and they uncovered not upon  your iniquity,  to turn your captivity; and they beheld for you [2concerns 1vain] and purgations.

15. ΣΑΜΕΧ [5clap 7over 8you 6hands 1All 2the ones 3passing 4in the way]; they whistle and shake  their head over the daughter of Jerusalem, Is she the city, they shall say, the crown of glory of gladness of all the earth?

16. ΑΙΝ [3opened 5wide 6against 7you 4their mouth 1All  2your enemies]. They whistled and gnashed their teeth. They said, We swallowed her down. Besides, this is the day which we expected; we found it, we saw it.

17. ΦΗ The lord did what he pondered. He completed his word which he gave charge from days of old. He demolished, and spared not, and he gladdened [2over 3you 1the enemy], He raised up high the horn of the one afflicting you.

18. ΣΑΔΗ [2yelled out 1Their heart] to the lord, saying, O walls of Zion, lead down [2as 3a rushing stream 1tears] day and night! And give soberness to yourself; neither let [3keep quiet 1the pupil 2of your eye]!

19. ΚΩΦ Rise up to meditate in the night! At the beginnings of your watch pour out [2as 3water 1your heart] before the face of the lord! Lift to him your hands for the lives of your infants, of the ones fainting from hunger at the corner of all the streets!

20. ΡΗΣ Behold, O lord, and look upon what you gleaned thus! Shall [2eat 1the women] the fruit of their belly? Shall [4be murdered 1infants 2nursing 3breasts]? Shall you kill in the sanctuary of the lord the priest and prophet?

21. ΣΙΝ [4went to bed 5on 6the ground 7in the street 1The boy 2and 3old man]; my virgins and my young men went into captivity by broadsword; by famine you killed; in the day of your anger you cut up, you spared not.

22. ΘΑΥ You called as in a day of holiday for my sojourners round about; and there was not in the day of anger of the lord one being rescued and being left behind, as I prevailed, and I filled [2my enemies 1all].  

## Lamentations 3

5. He built against me, and he encircled my head, and troubled me.

9. He blocked up my ways; he obstructed my roads; he disturbed me.

10. ΔΑΛΕΘ [2a bear 3lying in wait 1He is] for me, as a lion in a secret place.

13. Η He brought [3into  4my kidneys 1the poison 2from his quivers].

14. I became laughter to all my people, their psalm for the entire  day.

15. He filled me with bitterness; he intoxicated me with bile,

16. ΟΥΑΥ and he knocked out [2by a small stone 1my teeth]; he fed me ashes,

17. and he thrust away [2from 3peace 1my soul]. I forgot good things.

18. And I said, [2perished  1My victory], and  my hope from the lord.

19. ΖΑΙΝ I remembered because of my poorness, and of my persecution, of my bitterness, and of my bile.

20. I shall be remembered, and [2shall converse 3with 4me  1my soul]. 

21.  Waiting upon The LORD This I will arrange into  my heart; on account of this I will wait.

22. ΗΘ The mercies of the lord, for they finished not, for [2failed not  1his charities].

25. ΤΗΘ The lord is good to the ones waiting on him, the soul which shall seek him.

26. It is good, and he shall wait and shall be still for the deliverance of the lord.

28. ΙΩΘ He will sit down alone, and will keep silent, for he lifted it upon himself.

29. He shall put [2in 3dust  1his mouth]; if perhaps  there is hope.

30. He will give [2to the one 3hitting 4him 1his cheek]. He will be filled of scornings.

31. ΧΑΦ For not into the eon shall the lord thrust away.

32. For the one he humbled he shall pity, according to the multitude  of his mercy.

33. He was not answered from his heart, and he humbled sons of man,

34. ΛΑΜΕΔ  to humble under  his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

35.  to turn aside a judgment of a man over against the face of the highest,

36. to condemn mankind in  judging him, the lord did not say it.

37. ΜΗΝ Who thus spoke, and it came to pass, but the lord did not give charge?

38. From out of the mouth of the highest shall not come forth bad and  good?

39. Why does [3grumble 2man 1a living]; a man concerning  his sin?

40. ΝΟΥΝ [2was searched out  1Our way] and examined, and we should turn unto the lord.

41. We should lift up our hearts with our hands to the height in heaven.

42. We sinned, we were impious, and you atoned not.

43. ΣΑΜΕΧ You enveloped in rage, and banished us. You killed and spared not.

44. You enveloped [2with a cloud 1yourself] because of prayer to close my eyelids.

45. And to be thrust away you put us in the midst of the peoples.

46. ΑΙΝ [3opened wide 5against 6us 4their mouth 1All  2our enemies].

47. Fear and stupefaction was to us; haughtiness and destruction.

48. [3releases 4of waters 2shall lead down  1My eye] upon the destruction of the daughter  of my people.

49. ΦΗ  My eye was swallowed down and I shall not be quiet,  to not be sober,

50. until of which time [2should look through 3and 4should behold 1the lord] from out of heaven.

51.  My eye shall glean upon  my soul because of all the daughters of the city.

52. ΣΑΔΗ In hunting [2hunted 3me 4as 5a sparrow  1my enemies] freely.

53. They put to death [2in 3the pit 1my life], and they placed a stone upon me.

54. [2overflowed 1Water] upon  my head. I said, I am thrust away.

55. ΚΩΦ I called upon  your name, O lord, from out of [2pit 1the lowermost].

57. [2for  3my help 1You approached] in the day in which I called upon you. You said to me, Do not fear!

64. ΤΑΥ You shall recompense to them a recompense, O lord, according to the works  of their hands.

65. You shall recompense to them, while shielding [2of my heart 1the trouble].

66. You shall pursue them in anger, and shall completely consume them beneath the heaven, O lord.  

## Lamentations 4

1.  The Rage of The LORD Completed ΑΛΕΦ O how [3shall be darkened 1the 2gold], and [4changed 1the 3silver  2good]; [3were discharged 2stones 1holy] at the top of all the streets,

2. ΒΗΘ even the [2sons 3of Zion  1esteemed] being encouraged by gold, O how they are considered as [2receptacles 1earthenware], works of the hands of the potter.

3. ΓΙΜΕΛ And indeed, dragons stripped the breasts, they nursed their cubs; the daughters of my people were for irretrievability as a sparrow in the wilderness.

4. ΔΑΛΕΘ [4cleaves 1The 2tongue 3of one nursing] to  its throat in thirst. Infants ask for bread,  [2one snapping it 1there is not] for them.

5. Η The ones eating the delicacies were removed in the streets. The ones having been suckled in scarlet were embracing dung.

6. ΟΥΑΥ And [4was magnified 1the lawlessness 2of the daughter 3of my people] over the lawlessness of Sodom, the place being eradicated as with promptness, and they did not toil in her hands.

7. ΖΑΙΝ [2were clean 1Her Nazarites]; [2more than 3snow 1they radiated]; [2more than 3milk 1they were purified]. [2were above 3stone 4of sapphire  1Their broken pieces],

8. ΗΘ [2darkened 3above 4lamp black  1their appearance], they are not recognized in the streets; [2was fixed 1their skin] against  their bones; they are dried up, they were as wood.

9. ΤΗΘ Better were the ones slain by the broadsword than the ones slain by hunger; they went being pierced by want of produce of the fields.

10. ΙΩΘ The hands [2women 1of pitying] boiled  their children; they became for food to them in the destruction of the daughter  of my people.

11. ΧΑΦ The lord completed his rage; he poured out the rage of his anger, and lit a fire in Zion, and it devoured  her foundations.

12. ΛΑΜΕΔ [3believed not 1The kings 2of the earth], all the ones dwelling, the ones living, that [4shall enter 1an enemy 2and 3one afflicting] through the gates of Jerusalem,

13. ΜΗΜ because of the sins of her prophets, and iniquities of her priests, the ones pouring out [2blood 1just] in her midst.

14. ΝΟΥΝ [2were shaken  1Her watchmen] in the streets; they were tainted with blood in  [2not 3being able 1their]; they touched their garments with it.

15. ΣΑΜΕΧ Separate from the unclean! Call them! Separate, separate, do not touch! for they were lit, and indeed, they were shaken. Say among the nations! In no way should they proceed  to sojourn there.

16. ΑΙΝ The person of the lord was their portion; he shall not proceed to look upon them. The person of the priests they did not receive; [3old men 1they did not 2show mercy on].

17. ΦΗ Yet in our being, [2failed  1our eyes]. [3for 4our help 5was in vain 2watching 1Our]. We watched unto a nation not delivering.

18. ΣΑΔΗ They hunted our small ones  to not go into  our squares. [2approached  1Our time]; [2were fulfilled  1our days]; [2is at hand  1our end].

19. ΚΩΦ [5nimble 4were 1The ones 2pursuing 3us], more than eagles of heaven. Upon the mountains they perched; in a wilderness they lie in wait for us.

20. ΡΗΣ The breath of our face, the anointed one, the lord was seized in  our corruptions, of whom we said, In  his shadow we shall live among the nations.

21. ΣΙΝ Rejoice and be glad O daughter of Edom! the one dwelling upon the land of Uz! And indeed unto you shall go through the cup of the lord. You shall be intoxicated and shall pour forth.

22. ΘΑΥ [2is vanished  1Your lawlessness], O daughter of Zion. He shall not proceed unto the resettling you. He visited your lawlessness, O daughter of Edom; he revealed concerning  your acts of impiety.  

## Lamentations 5

1.  Jeremiah Laments the Destruction Remember, O lord, what happened to us! Look upon and behold  our scorn!

2. Our inheritance was converted over to aliens; our houses to strangers.

3. [2orphans 1We were]; there does not exist a father; our mothers are as  widows.

4. [2our water 3for 4money 1We drank]; our wood [2in 3barter 1came].

5. Unto  our neck we were pursued; we tired; we were not rested.

6. Egypt gave a hand; Assyria for their plenty.

7.  Our fathers sinned, and they do not exist; we  [2their violations of the law 1underwent].

9. With  our lives we will carry in our bread from in front of the broadsword of the wilderness.

11. [2women 3in 4Zion 1They abased], virgins in the cities of Judah.

12. Rulers [2by 3their hands 1were hanged]; elders were not extolled;

13. chosen men [2weeping 1took up], and young men [2in 3wood bearing 1weakened].

14. And old men [2from 3the gate 1ceased]; chosen men [2from 3their psalms 1ceased].

15. [3rested up 1Joy 2of our heart]; [2turned 3into 4mourning  1our dance].

16. [4fell 1The 2crown  3of our head]; and woe to us for we sinned.

17. On account of this [4became 1grief 5grievous 2in 3our heart]; on account of this, [2darkened  1our eyes].

18. Upon mount Zion, for it was obliterated, foxes went through in it.

19. But you, O lord, [2into 3the 4eon 1shall dwell];  your throne is unto generation and generation.

20. Why for victory shall you forget us? Will you forsake us unto the duration of days?

21. Turn us to you! O lord, and we shall be turned; and renew our days as before!

22. For in thrusting away, you thrusted us away; you were provoked to anger against us, unto exceedingly.
