## Proverbs 1

1.  Wisdom The proverbs of Solomon son of David who reigned in Israel,

2. to know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend also words of intelligence;

3. to receive also the shifting and turning of words, and loosening enigmas; to comprehend also [2righteousness 1true] and [2judgment 1to straighten out],

4. that he should give to the guileless astuteness, [3child 1but 2to the young] perception, and also reflection.

5. But of the ones for hearing, the wise will be wiser, and the intelligent [2guidance 1shall acquire].

6. He shall comprehend also a parable and a dark matter; sayings also of the wise, and enigmas.

7. The beginning of wisdom is fear of the lord, [3understanding 1and 2good] to all the ones observing it. And piety to God is the beginning of perception. But wisdom and instruction the impious shall treat with contempt.

8. Hear, O son, the laws of your father! and you should not thrust away the rules of your mother;

9. [3a crown 1for 4of favors 2you shall receive] for your head, and a collar of gold around your neck.

10. O son, you should not have caused [3to wander you 2men 1impious], nor should you consent.

11. If they should comfort you, saying, Come with us, partake in blood! for we should hide [4in 5the ground 2man 1the just 3unjustly],

12. and we should swallow him as Hades, while living, and lift his  remembrance from the earth,

13. the [2property 3of his  1very costly] we should overtake, and we should fill [2houses 1our] of spoils.

14.  and [2your 3lot 1throw] in with us, and [3money bag 2one 1let there become] for us.

15. You should not go in the ways with them. Turn aside  your foot from  their paths!

16.  For their feet [2to 3evil 1run], and are quick  to pour out blood.

17. [3are not 1For 5wrongfully 4stretched out 2nets] for feathered birds.

18. For they, the ones [2in murder 1partaking], treasure up for themselves evils.

19. These [2the 3ways 1are] of all the ones completing the lawless things. For by impiety  [2their own 3life 1they remove].

20. Wisdom [2in 3the streets 1sings praise]; and in the squares in open places she celebrates.

21. [3upon 4the tops 1And 5of the walls 2she proclaims]; and at the gates of the city courageously says,

22. As much time as the guileless have of the righteousness, they shall not be ashamed; but the fools  [3insolence 1being 2ones who crave], [2impious 1having become], detest good sense,

23. and [2accountable 1become] for reproofs. Behold, I will let go to you my breath's saying, and I will teach you  by my word.

24. Since I called, and you did not obey; and I stretched out words, and you did not take heed;

25. but [4void 1you made 2my 3counsels],  and [3to my 4reproofs 1you did not 2give heed];

26. accordingly I also  [2your 3destruction 1laugh at]; and I will rejoice when ever [2comes 3to you 1ruin].

27. And when ever [2should arrive 3unto you 4suddenly 1a tumult], and the undoing of yourself like a blast is at hand; or whenever [4should come upon 5you 1affliction 2and 3assault];

28. that it will be whenever you should call upon me, even I shall not listen to you. [2shall seek 3me 1Evil men], and will not find me;

29. for they detested wisdom, and the fear of the lord they did not prefer;

30. nor wanted [2to my 1to take heed] counsels; but they sneered at my reproofs.

31. Accordingly they shall eat  [3of their own 4way 1the 2fruits], and  [2with their own 3impiety 1shall be filled].

32. For because they wronged the simple ones, they shall be slaughtered, and an inquisition [2the impious 1shall destroy].

33. But the one hearing me shall encamp with hope, and shall be tranquil without fear from all evil.  

## Proverbs 2

1.  Seeking Wisdom O son, if receiving the saying of my commandment, you shall hide it unto yourself;

2. [2shall obey 3wisdom  1your ear], and you shall set aside your heart unto understanding; and you shall set it for admonition to your son.

3. For if  [2wisdom 1you should call upon], and  [3for understanding 1should give 2your voice];

4.  and [3perception 1you should seek 2great] with your voice; and if you should seek her as silver, and [2as for 3treasures 1should search her out];

5. then you shall perceive the fear of the lord, and [2full knowledge 3of God 1you will find].

6. For the lord gives wisdom; and from his presence knowledge and understanding.

7. And he treasures up [2to the ones 3keeping straight 1deliverance]; and he will shield  their goings;

8.  to guard the way of right actions; and the way of the ones venerating him he will protect. 

9.  Benefits of Wisdom Then you shall perceive righteousness and judgment, and you shall set up all courses of action for good things.

10. For if [2shall come  1wisdom] into your consideration,  and perception  [4for your 5soul 3good 2to be 1shall seem];

11. [2counsel 1good] shall guard you, [3reflection 1and 2sacred] will keep you,

12. that it should rescue you from [2way 1the evil], and from the man speaking nothing trustworthy. 

13.  Abandoning Wisdom O the ones abandoning [2ways 1the straight]  to go in the ways of darkness.

14. O the ones being glad over evils, and rejoicing over [2perverseness 1evil];

15. which  paths are crooked, and [3curved  2tracks 1their];

16.  [3to be far 2you 1to cause] from [2way 1the straight], and alien  of a righteous design. O son, you should not let [3overtake you 1bad 2counsel],

17. which left the instruction of youth, and [3covenant 2the divine 1forgot].

18. For she put [2near  3death  1her house], and [2lead by  3Hades 4with 5the 6earthborn  1her courses of action].

19. All the ones coming near with her shall not return; nor shall they overtake [2paths 1straight]; for they are not overtaken by years of life.

20. For if they went by [2paths 1good], they would have found even the paths of righteousness smooth. [3will be gracious 1The inhabitants 2of the earth], and the guileless will be left behind in her.

21. For the upright shall encamp in the land, and the sacred ones will be left behind in it.

22. And the ways of the impious [2from 3the earth 1shall be destroyed], and the lawbreakers shall be banished from it.  

## Proverbs 3

1.  Yield to God with Your Whole Heart O son, [2my 3laws 1forget not], and [2my sayings 1give heed to] in your heart!

2. For the length of existence, and years of life and peace shall be added to you.

3. Charity and trust -- do not let them fail to you! but affix them upon your neck! write them upon the tablet of your heart!

4. and you shall find favor. And think beforehand on the good things before the lord and men!

5. Be yielding with your whole heart upon God, and upon your own wisdom be not encouraged!

6. In all your ways make her known! that she should cut straight  your ways.

7. Be not skilled of yourself, but fear  God, and turn aside from all evil!

8. Then shall there be healing to your body, and care to your bones.

9. Esteem the lord by your just toils, and dedicate to him from your fruits of righteousness!

10. that [2should be filled  1your storerooms] with fullness of grain, and wine  [2of your wine vats 1should gush out].

11. O son, do not have little regard for the instruction of the lord, nor loosen up under his reproving!

12. For whom the lord loves he corrects; and he whips every son whom he welcomes. 

13.  Results of Wisdom Blessed is the man who found wisdom, and the mortal who beholds intelligence.

14. For it is better to trade for her, than for gold and silver treasures.

15. [3more valuable than 1And 2she is 5stones 4very costly]; and every valuable thing [2not 3equal 5worth 4her 1is].

16. For length of existence and years of life are in  her right hand; and in  her left riches and glory. Out of  her mouth goes forth in righteousness; and law and mercy [2upon 3her tongue 1she wears].

17.  Her ways [2ways 1are good], and all  her paths are in peace.

18. [2a tree 3of life 1She is] to all the ones holding her; and to the ones leaning upon her [2as 3upon 4the lord 1are safe].

19.  God in wisdom founded the earth; and he prepared the heavens in intelligence.

20. In his perception abysses were torn, and clouds flowed dew.

21. O son, you should not let it flow by; but heed my counsel and insight!

22. that [2should live  1your soul], and favor should be around your neck; and it will be healing to your flesh, and care to your bones;

23. that you should go yielded in peace in all  your ways, and the foot of yours in no way should stumble.

24. For if you should sit down, you will be without fear; and if you should repose, [2with pleasure 1you shall sleep].

25. And you shall not be afraid of terror coming upon, nor the thrusting of the impious coming upon.

26. For the lord will be over all your ways, and he shall establish your foot that you should not be shaken.

27. You should not be at a distance [2good 1to do] to the one lacking, when you should have  your hand to help.

28. You should not say, Returning back, come back again! and tomorrow I will give; [2able 5is with you 1while being 4good 3to do]; for you shall not see what shall give birth  against you.

29. You should not contrive [2against 3your 4friend 1bad things], the one sojourning and relying upon you.

30. You should not be fond of quarreling against a man in vain, so that [2not 5against 6you 1he should 3work 4evil].

31. You should not acquire evils of men's scorn, nor should you be jealous  of their ways.

32. [4is unclean 1For 5before 6the lord 2every 3lawbreaker], [4with 1and 5the righteous 2they do not 3sit together].

33. The curse of the lord is in the houses of the impious, but the properties of the just are blessed.

34. The lord [2the proud 1resists], [4to the humble 1but 2gives 3favor].

35. [3glory 1The wise 2shall inherit]; but the impious exalted dishonor.  

## Proverbs 4

1.  Hear! Take Heed! Take Hold! Hear, O children, the instruction of a father, and take heed to know insight!

2. [5gift 1For 4a good 2I present 3to you];  [3my 4word 1you should not 2abandon].

3. [4a son 1For 2I was 3also 6to a father 5subject], and being loved in the presence of a mother;

4. the ones who spoke and taught me, saying, Establish  our word in your heart! Keep the commandments! Do not forget!

5. Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! You should not forget, nor should you ignore the saying of my mouth; nor should you turn aside from the words of my mouth.

6. You should not abandon it, for it shall hold to you. Love it passionately! and it will keep you.

7. [2is the beginning 1Wisdom], acquire wisdom! And in all of your possessing acquire understanding!

8. Surround her with a rampart! and she shall exalt you. Esteem her! that she should keep you;

9. that she should give [3to 4your 5head 1a crown 2of favors], [4with a crown 1and 5of luxury 2should shield 3you].

10. Hear, O son, and receive my words! and [3will be multiplied 4to you 1years 2of your life], that to you there should be many ways of life.

11. For the ways of wisdom I teach you; [2I put 4on board 1and 3you 6tracks 5straight].

12. For when you should go [3will not 4be hemmed in 1your  2footsteps]; and when you should run, you shall not tire.

13. Take hold of my instruction! you should not let go; but keep it to yourself, for your life!

14. [3ways 2by impious 1You should not come], nor be jealous of the ways of lawbreakers. 

15.  The Ways of Lawbreakers Versus the Just In what ever place they should encamp, you should not come there. Turn aside from them and alter course!

16. [3not 1For 2they shall] sleep, unless they should have done evil. [2is removed 1Sleep] from them, and they do not go to bed.

17. For thus they feed well on grain of impiety; and by wine of a lawbreaker they are intoxicated.

18. But the ways of the just are likened to light -- they radiate. They go before and give light until whenever [3should set up 1the 2day].

19. But the ways of the impious are dark; they do not know how they stumble.

20. O son, [2to my 3saying 1take heed],  and to my words set aside your ear!

21. so that [2should not 3fail 4you  1your springs]. Keep them in your heart!

22. [3life 1for 2they are] to all the ones finding them, and [2to all 3flesh 1 healing].

23. With all guard, give heed to your heart! for from out of these things are the issues of life.

24. Remove yourself from a crooked mouth, and [2unjust 3lips 4far 5from 6you 1thrust away]!

25.  [2your eyes 4straight 1Let 3see],  and your eyelids nod assent to the just!

26. [2straight 3tracks 1Make] for your feet, and  [2your ways 1straighten out]!

27. You should not turn aside unto the right nor unto the left; but turn your foot from [2way 1an evil]! For the ways, the ones of the right, [2knows  1God]; but the ones perverting are  of the left; but he [3straight 1makes  2your tracks],  and [2your goings 3in 4peace 1he shall lead before].  

## Proverbs 5

1.  Wisdom to a Son O son, [2to my 3wisdom 1take heed], [5to my 1and 6words 2set aside 3your 4ear]!

2. that you should guard [2insight 1good]. And perception of my lips I give charge to you. Give no heed to a vile woman!

3. For honey drops from the lips [2woman 1of a harlot], which for a time fattens your throat.

4. Afterwards however [2more bitter 3than bile 1you shall find it], and being more sharpened rather than [2sword 1a double-edged].

5.  For [3of folly 1the 2feet] lead [4down 1the ones 2dealing with 3her 7with 8death 5unto  6Hades];  and her tracks are not established;

6. [4the ways 1for 5of life 2she does not 3come by]; [3are slippery 1but  2her tracks], and not well-known.

7. Now then, O son, hear me! and you should not [2void works 1do] of my words.

8. [4far 1Make 5from 6her 2your 3way]! You should not approach to doors of her houses;

9. that you should not let [2go 3to others 1your means of life], and your livelihood to the unmerciful;

10. that [2should not 3be filled with 1strangers] your strength,  and your toils [2into 3houses 4of strangers 1should enter];

11. and you shall be repenting at last when ever [2wears away 1the flesh] from your body.

12. And you shall say, O how I detested instruction, and [3reproofs 2turned aside  1my heart]!

13. I did not hear the voice of one correcting me and teaching me; nor did I set aside  my ear.

14. By little I came unto every evil in the midst of the assembly and congregation.

15. O son, drink waters from your own receptacles, and [2from 3your own 4wells 1the flow]!

16. Let [3overflow 4to you 1the 2waters] from out of  your own spring; and into your own squares let [3go along  1your 2waters]!

17. Let it be [2to you 3alone 1existing], and let not a stranger partake with you!

18. The spring of your  water -- let it be to you in particular! and be glad with the wife  of your youth!

19. Let your hind of friendship, and [2filly 1your] of favors, consort with you!  and in particular let her be esteemed by you, and be with you at all time! For in  this friendship [2accommodated 3a great deal 1you will be].

20. [2not 3much 1Be] with the strange woman, nor hold [4in embraces 1the one 2not 3your own]!

21. [5before 1For 4are 6the  8of God 7eyes 2the ways 3of a man], [3unto 1and 4all  5his tracks 2he watches].

22. Unlawful deeds [2a man 1ensnare]; [4chains 1and  5of ones own 6sins 2each 3is grasped by].

23. This man comes to an end with the uninstructed; and from the abundance  of his own sustenance was cast forth, and perished through folly.  

## Proverbs 6

1.  Surety for Fools O son, if you should guarantee a loan for your friend, you shall deliver up your hand to the enemy.

2. [6snare 1For 5are a strong 2a man's  3own 4lips], and he is captured by the words of his own mouth.

3. Do, O son, what I give charge to you, and preserve yourself! [5you come 1For 6into 7the hands 8of evils 2on account of 3your 4friend]. Be not enfeebled! but you provoke even  your friend whom you guaranteed a loan. 

4.  Laziness You should not give sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your eyelids,

5. so that you should escape as a doe from nooses, and as a fowl from out of a snare.

6. Be as the ant, O lazy one, and be jealous beholding  his ways; and become as that one -- wiser!

7. For to that one there is no farm possession, nor  [2one compelling him 1is he having], nor [2under 3a master 1is he being].

8. He prepares [3of summer 1the 2nourishment], [3much 1and also 4in 5the 6harvest 2he prepares] for the fete.

9. For how long, O lazy one, do you recline? And when [2from out of 3sleep 1will you arise]?

10. A little then to sleep, and a little you sit down, and a little you slumber, and a little you fold your arms with hands to the breasts.

11. So then [2comes upon 3you 4as 5an evil 6traveler  1poverty]; and  lack as a good runner. 

12.  Attributes of a Fool A man, a fool and a lawbreaker, shall go by ways not good.

13. And the same beckons with the eyes, and makes signs with the foot, and teaches with the beckoning of his fingers.

14. [3being perverted 1And 2a heart] contrives evils; at all time  such a one [2disturbances 1concocts] to a city.

15. On account of this [3suddenly 2comes  1his destruction]; severance and [2destruction 1irretrievable].

16. For he rejoices in all things which [3detests 1the 2 lord]; and he is destroyed because of uncleanness of soul --

17. [2eye 1an insulting], [2tongue 1an unjust], hands pouring out [2blood 1righteous],

18. and a heart contriving [2devices 1evil], and feet hurrying to do evil.

19. [3kindles 4lying 2witness 1An unjust], and brings in addition judicial cases between brethren. 

20.  Guard Parental Advice O son, guard the laws of your father! and you should not thrust away the rules of your mother.

21. But affix them upon your soul always, and bind them with a cord around your neck!

22. When ever you should walk, bring it, and [2with 3you 1let it be]! And when ever you should sleep, let it guard you! that in arising it should converse together with you.

23. For [3is a lamp 1the commandment 2of the law], and a light, and a way of life, and reproof, and instruction; 

24.  Guard from Adultery  to guard you from [2woman 1a married], and from the distraction [2tongue 1of a strange].

25. O son, let not [3overcome you 2of beauty 1the desire], nor [3be caught 1your 2eyes] nor seized by  her eyelids.

26. For the value of a harlot is as much as even one bread loaf; and a woman [4of men 2the precious 3souls 1ensnares].

27. Shall anyone tie up fire in his bosom,  and his garments not incinerate?

28. Or shall anyone walk upon coals of fire,  and his feet shall not incinerate.

29. So the one entering to [2woman 1a married]; he shall not be acquitted, nor any one  touching her.

30. It is not a wonder if any be captured stealing; for he steals that he should fill up his soul when hungering;

31. but if he should be captured he shall pay seven-fold, and [4all  5his possessions 3by giving 1shall rescue 2himself].

32. But the adulterer, through lack of sense, [2destruction  3for his soul 1procures].

33. Both griefs and dishonor he suffers,  and his scorn shall not be wiped away into the eon.

34. [4is full 1For 5of zeal 2the rage 3of her husband]; he will not spare in the day of judgment.

35. He will not bargain for any ransom  of his hatred, nor part by many gifts.  

## Proverbs 7

1. O son, keep my words,  and my commandments hide for yourself!

2. O son, esteem the lord! and you shall strengthen; and besides him, do not fear another! Keep my commandments! and you shall spend life;  and my words as if the pupil of your eyes.

3. Put them on your fingers, and inscribe them upon the width  of your heart!

4. Speak  wisdom [2your 3sister 1to be];  and [3intelligence 4as an acquaintance 1procure 2to yourself]!

5. that she should keep you from [4woman 1the strange 2and 3wicked], if [2words for you  3for 4favor 1she should put].

6. For from the window of  her house [2into 3the 4squares 1she leans]

7. at whom ever she should behold of the foolish offspring -- a young man lacking of sense,

8. passing by the corner in the corridors of her houses, speaking

9. in darkness during the evening, when ever all is at rest nightly, or also at dimness.

10. And the woman meets with him [2the appearance 1having] of a harlot, which makes [2of young men 3to flutter 1the heart].

11. [3inciting 1And 2she is] and carnal, [5in 6her house 1and 3do not 4stay still  2her feet].

12. [3time 1For 2at certain 5outside 4she strays], and another time [2in 3the squares 4by 5every 6corner 1she lies in wait].

13. Then, taking hold, she fondles him; and with impudent face she says to him,

14. [3sacrifice 2a peace 4with me 1There is], today I render  my vows.

15. Because of this I come forth for meeting you; feeling the absence  of your face I have found you.

16. In trimming, I have stretched  my bed. [2spreads 1I spread]  from Egypt.

17. I have sprinkled  my bed with saffron,  and my house with cinnamon.

18. Come! for we should enjoy friendship until dawn. Come, for we should wrap up in passion.

19. [3is not 1For 4at hand  2my husband] in the house; he has gone [2way 1a long],

20. [2a bundle 3of silver 1taking] in his hands; for only after [2days 1many] will he come back again to  his house.

21. [2she led 4astray 1And 3him] with much companionship, [2with nooses 1and also]. By the things from her lips she led him aground.

22.  And he followed after her, being easily led on, and as an ox [2unto 3slaughter 1is led], and as a dog to bonds, and as a stag shot with a bow,

23. striking into the liver; and he hastens as a fowl into a snare, not seeing that [2for 3his life 1he runs].

24. Now then, O son, hear me, and take heed to the sayings of my mouth!

25. Do not turn aside to  her ways with your heart! and you should not be misled by her short-cuts.

26. [3many 1For 4in piercing 2she has thrown down], and innumerable are whom she has murdered.

27. [2is the ways 3of Hades  1Her house]; they lead down into the storerooms  of death. 

## Proverbs 8

1.  Wisdom Calls You  [2wisdom 1shall proclaim], that intellect should obey you.

2. [3upon 1For 4the 5high 6extremities 2she is], [3in the midst 1and 4of the 5paths 2she stands].

3. For by the gates of mighty ones she is occupied; and in the entrances sings, saying,

4. You, O men, I comfort; and I let go with my voice to the sons of men.

5. Comprehend, O guileless ones, astuteness! and O uninstructed, insert it in heart!

6. Listen to me! [3serious things 1for 2I shall speak], and I will offer [2from 3my lips 1straight things]!

7. For [3truth 2shall meditate  1my throat]; [4are abhorrent 1and 5before 6me 3lips 2lying].

8. [5are with 6righteousness 1All 2the 3sayings  4of my mouth]; nothing in them is crooked nor insidious.

9. All is face to face to the ones perceiving; and straight to the ones finding knowledge.

10. Receive instruction, and not silver! and knowledge above [2gold 1tried].

11. [3is better 1For 2wisdom 5stones 4than very costly]; and every esteemed thing [2not 3worth 4her 1is]. 

12.  Advantage of Wisdom I  wisdom encamped with counsel and knowledge; and [3reflection 1I 2called upon].

13. The fear of the lord detests injustice; insolence also, and pride, and the ways of evil ones; [3have detested 1and 2I] the perverting ways of evil men.

14. [4are mine 1Counsel 2and 3safety]; [2is mine 1intelligence], [3is mine 1and 2strength].

15. By me kings reign, and the mighty ones write righteousness.

16. Through me great men become magnified, and sovereigns through me take hold of the earth.

17. I [2the ones 4me 3being fond of 1love]; and the ones seeking me shall find favor.

18. Wealth and glory exist by me, and [2property 1much] and righteousness.

19. Best to gather my fruit than gold and [2stone 1precious];  and my produce is better than [2silver 1choice].

20. [2in 3the ways 4of righteousness 1I walk], and [2in the midst 3of paths 4of reason 1I return];

21. that I shall portion [2to the ones 3loving me 1substance]; and  their treasuries I shall fill up of good things. If I should announce to you the things [2each 3day 1happening], I will remember also [2the things 3of 4the eon 1to count]. 

22.  Origin of Wisdom The lord created me the head of his ways for his works.

23. Before the eon he founded me in the beginning, before the [2the 3earth 1making];

24. and before the [2the 3abysses 1making]; before the coming forth of the springs  of waters;

25. before [2of the 3mountains 1the seating]; and before all the hills he engenders me.

26. The lord made regions, and uninhabited places, and uttermost parts of the inhabitable world  under the heavens.

27. When he prepared the heaven, I was present with him, and when he separated  his throne upon the winds;

28. when [5strong 1he made 2the 3upward 4clouds]; and as [5safe 1he made 2the springs  3under 4heaven];

29. in the putting [2to the 3sea 1of his restriction]; and the waters shall not go by his mouth; and as [6strong 1he made 2the 3foundations 4of the 5earth],
