## 1 Corinthians 1

1.  Paul Gives Thanks Paul, a chosen apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,

2. to the assembly  of God, to the one being in Corinth, having been sanctified in Christ Jesus, chosen holy ones, with all the ones calling upon the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours.

3. Favor to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I give thanks to my God at all times for you, for the favor  of God, to the one being given to you in Christ Jesus;

5. that in everything you were enriched in him in all word and in all knowledge;

6. as the testimony of the Christ was firmed up in you,

7. so that you be not lacking in not one favor; awaiting the revelation  of our Lord Jesus Christ,

8. who also will firm up you unto the end, without reproach in the day  of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. Trustworthy  is God through whom you were called into a fellowship  of his son Jesus Christ  our Lord. 

10.  Divisions among the Brethren And I appeal to you, brethren, through the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ, that [4the 5same thing 1you should 3say 2all], and there should be no [2among 3you 1splits]; but that you should be readying yourselves with the same mind, and with the same opinion.

11. For it was made manifest to me concerning you, my brethren, by the ones of Chloe, that [2strifes 3among 4you 1there are].

12. And I say this, that each of you says, I indeed am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

13. Has [3been portioned 1the 2Christ]? Was Paul crucified for you? Or in the name of Paul were you immersed?

14. I give thanks to God that not one of you I immersed except Crispus and Gaius,

15. that not any should say that in  my name he was immersed.

16. And I immersed also the house of Stephanas; the rest I do not know if any other I immersed.

17. [3did not 1For 4send 5me 2Christ] to immerse, but to announce good news; not in wisdom of word, lest [5should be an empty work 1the 2cross 3of the 4Christ]. 

18.  Christ -- God's Power and Wisdom  For the word, the one of the cross, to the ones indeed perishing is moronishness; but to the ones being preserved, to us [2the power 3of God 1it is].

19. For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and the understanding of the experts I will disregard.

20. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater  of this eon? Did not [2make moronish  1God] the wisdom  of this world?

21. For since in the wisdom  of God [3did not 4know 1the 2world 6through  7wisdom  5God], [2thought well  1God] through the moronishness of the proclamation to deliver the ones believing.

22. Since both Jews [2a sign 1ask for], and Greeks [2by wisdom 1seek];

23. but we proclaim Christ being crucified, to Jews indeed an obstacle, and to Greeks moronishness;

24. but to these the chosen, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God's power and God's wisdom.

25. For the moronish  of God [2wiser than 3the wisdom 4of men 1is]; and the weakness  of God [2stronger than 3the strength 4of men 1is].

26. For you see  your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many mighty, not many well-born.

27. But the moronish of the world God chose, that the wise should be disgraced; and the weak of the world God chose, that [3should be disgraced 1the 2strong].

28. And the ignoble of the world, and the ones being treated with contempt God chose, and the things not being; that the things being he should render useless;

29. so that [3should not 4boast 1all 2flesh] before him.

30. [4of 5him 1But 2you 3are] in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, both righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom;

31. that, as it has been written, The one boasting, [2in 3the Lord 1let him boast]!  

## 1 Corinthians 2

1.  The Wisdom of God Revealed And I having come to you, brethren, I came not according to superiority of word or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony  of God.

2. [3not 1For 2I decided]  to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this one being crucified.

3. And I in weakness, and in fear, and in [2trembling 1much] was with you;

4. and  my word, and  my proclaiming was not in persuasive human [2of wisdom 1words], but in a demonstration of spirit and power;

5. that the belief of yours should not be in wisdom of men, but in power of God.

6. [3wisdom 1But 2we speak] among the ones completed; but wisdom not  of this eon, nor of the rulers  of this eon of the ones being rendered useless.

7. But we speak wisdom of God in a mystery, the one being concealed, which God predefined before the eons for our glory;

8. which not one of the rulers  of this eon has known. For if they knew, [3not 2would 5the 6Lord  7of glory 1they 4have crucified].

9. But as it has been written, That which eye saw not, and ear heard not, and into the heart of man ascended not, which God prepared to the ones loving him.

10. But to us  God revealed by  his spirit. For the spirit searches all things, even the deep things  of God.

11. For who [2knows 1of men] the things  of man, except the spirit of the man, the one in him? So also the things  of God no one knows, except the spirit  of God.

12. But we [2not 3the 4spirit 5of the 6world 1received], but the spirit, the one from  God, that we should know the things [3by  4God 1being granted 2to us].

13. Which also we speak not in [2instructed 3by human 4wisdom 1words], but by words instructed [2spirit 1of holy]; [3in spiritual ways 1spiritual things 2being interpreted].

14. But the physical man does not receive the things of the spirit  of God; [3moronishness 1for 4to him 2they are], and he is not able to know them, for [2spiritually 1they are examined].

15. But the spiritual examines indeed all things, but he [2by 3no one 1is examined].

16. For who knew the mind of the Lord? Who instructs him? But we [2the mind 3of Christ 1have].  

## 1 Corinthians 3

1.  Divisions among the Brethren And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as fleshly ones, as infants in Christ.

2. [3milk 2you 1I gave 4to drink] and not food; for not yet were you able, and neither yet now are you able.

3. [3still 1For 4fleshly ones 2you are]. For where among you are jealousy and strife and discord; [2not 3fleshly ones 1are you], and [2according to 3man 1walk]?

4. For whenever one should say, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos, [2not 3fleshly ones 1are you]?

5. Who then is Paul, and who Apollos? but only servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave?

6. I planted, Apollos watered, but  God gave growth.

7. So that neither the one planting is anything, nor the one watering; but the one giving growth is God.

8. [2the one 3planting 1And] and the one watering are one; and each [2his own 3wage 1shall receive] according to his own toil.

9. [4of God 1For 2we are 3fellow-workers], of God's farm. [2God's 3construction 1You are]. 

10.  Jesus is the Foundation According to the favor  of God, the one being given to me, as a wise architect [2the foundation 1I set], and another builds. [3each 1But 2let] take heed how he builds!

11. [3foundation 1For 2another] no one is able to set except the one being laid, which is Jesus Christ.

12. And if anyone builds upon  this foundation gold, silver, [2stones 1precious], wood, grass, stubble;

13. [3of each 1the 2work 5apparent 4shall become]; for the day will manifest it. For by fire it is revealed; and of each  work [4what it is like 1the 2fire 3shall prove].

14. If anyone's  work abides which he built upon, [2a wage 1he shall receive].

15. If anyone's  work shall be incinerated, he shall suffer loss; but he shall be delivered; but thus as through fire. 

16.  The Temple of God Do you not know that [2a temple 3of God 1you are], and the spirit  of God lives in you?

17. If anyone [2the 3temple  4of God 1corrupts], [2shall corrupt 3this one  1God]; for the temple  of God is holy, which you are.

18. [2no one 4himself 1Let 3cheat]! If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in  this eon, [2moronish 1let him become]! that he should become wise.

19. For the wisdom  of this world [2moronishness 3with  4God 1is]. For it has been written, He is the one grabbing the wise in  their cleverness.

20. And again, The Lord knows the devices of the wise, that they are vain.

21. So that let no one boast among men! For all things are yours.

22. Whether Paul, whether Apollos, whether Cephas, whether the world, whether life, whether death, whether things present, whether things about to be; all are yours;

23. but you are of Christ, and Christ of God.  

## 1 Corinthians 4

1.  Servants of Christ So [4us 1let 3consider 2a man] as servants of Christ, and managers of the mysteries of God!

2. But remaining, it is sought in the managers that [3trustworthy 1one 2should be found].

3. But to me  [2a least thing 1it is 3that 5by 6you 4I should be examined], or by a human's day. But not even myself do I examine.

4. For nothing by myself am I fully conscious; but not in this have I been justified; but the one examining me is the Lord.

5. So that [2not 4before 5its time 3anything 1judge]! until whenever [3should come 1the 2Lord], who both will give light to the hidden things of the darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then the high praise shall be to each from  God. 

6.  Paul Questions Motives And these things, brethren, I changed appearance to myself and Apollos on account of you, that in us you should learn  not [2above 3what 4has been written 1to think], that not one over  one you be inflated against the other.

7. For who scrutinizes you? And what do you have which you have not received? And if also you received, why do you boast as not having received?

8. [2already 3satisfied 1Are you]? [2already 1Are you] enriched? [2apart from 3us 1Do you reign]? And I ought indeed that you reigned, that also we with you should have reigned together.

9. For I think that  God [2us 3apostles 4last 1exhibited] as condemned to death, for [2a theater 1we became] to the world, and to angels, and to men.

10. We are moronish on account of Christ, but you are skilled in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are without honor. 

11.  Afflictions of the Apostles As far as the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and unsettled;

12. and we tire working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;

13. being blasphemed, we appeal; as the rubbish of the world, we were of all the sweepings until now.

14. Not shaming you do I write these things, but as [3children 1my 2beloved] I admonish you.

15. For if [2ten thousand 3instructors 1you should have] in Christ, but not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus through the good news I engendered you.

16. I appeal to you then, [2mimics 3of me 1become]!

17. On account of this I send to you Timothy, who is [3child 1my 2beloved], and trustworthy in the Lord, who shall remind you  of my ways -- the ones in Christ, as everywhere in every assembly I teach.

18. [2as to 4not 5coming 1And 3my] to you, some were inflated.

19. But I shall come quickly to you, if the Lord should want, and I will know, not the word of the ones being inflated, but the power.

20. For not [4in 5word 1is the 2kingdom  3of God], but in power.

21. What do you want? [2with 3a rod 1Should I come] to you, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?  

## 1 Corinthians 5

1.  Reports of Immorality [3wholly 2is 4heard 5among 6you 1Harlotry], and such harlotry which not even among the nations is named, so as for [4wife 1one  3his father's 2to have].

2. And you, are you being inflated, and not rather mourned, that [4should be removed 5from 6your midst 1the one  3this work 2having done].

3. For indeed I (as being absent  in body, but being at hand  in spirit,) already have judged as one being at hand the one thus manufacturing this,

4. in the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ, having brought together you and  my spirit, with the power, of the one of our Lord Jesus Christ,

5. to deliver up  such  to Satan for ruin of the flesh, that the spirit should be delivered in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6. [2is not 3good  1Your boasting]. Do you not know that a little yeast [2the entire  3batch 1leavens]?

7. Clear out then the old yeast! that you should be a new batch, as you are unleavened breads. For indeed  [2our passover 4for 5us 3was sacrificed 1Christ].

8. So that we should solemnize a holiday, not with [2yeast 1old], nor with yeast of evil and wickedness; but with unleavened breads of honesty and truth.

9. I wrote to you in the letter not to intermingle with fornicators.

10. But not assuredly with the fornicators  of this world, or with the hoarders of wealth, or predacious, or idolaters; since you ought then [2from out of 3the 4world 1to come forth].

11. But now I wrote to you to not intermingle, if any brother being named, be a fornicator, or a hoarder of wealth, or an idolater, or a reviler, or an intoxicated person, or predacious; to the one such not even to eat with.

12. For what is it to me and the ones outside to judge, [2not 4the ones 5inside 1shall you 3judge]?

13. But the ones outside  God judges. And you shall lift away the wicked one from you of them.  

## 1 Corinthians 6

1.  Lawsuits among the Saints Dare any one of you, [2a thing 1having] against the other, plead before the unjust, and not before the holy ones?

2. Do you not know that the holy ones [2the 3world 1shall judge]? And if by you [3is judged 1the 2world], are you unworthy of the judgment seat of the least?

3. Do you not know that [2angels 1we shall judge]? how much more indeed of the cares of life?

4. [6the cares of life 5as to 3then 4the judgment seat 1If 2you have] of the ones being treated with contempt, [3in 4the 5assembly 2of these 1then do you sit]?

5. To make you ashamed I speak. So is there not one among you being a wise man, nor one who is able to litigate between  his brother?

6. But brother against brother goes to law, and this before unbelievers.

7. Already indeed then utterly [2failure 3among 4you 1there is], for [2lawsuits 1you have] with yourselves. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be deprived?

8. But you do wrong and deprive, and these things of brethren.

9. Or do you not know that the unjust [3the kingdom 4of God 1shall not 2inherit]? Do not be misled; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor soft, nor homosexuals,

10. nor thieves, nor hoarders of wealth, nor intoxicated ones, nor revilers, nor predacious [2the kingdom 3of God 1shall inherit].

11. And [3these 1some 2of you were]; but you were washed off, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit  of our God. 

12.  Sexual Immorality All things to me are allowed, but not all advantageous; all things to me are allowed, but [3not 1I 2shall] be brought under the authority by any.

13. The foods are for the belly, and the belly for the foods;  but God [2both 3this body 4and 5these foods 1will render useless]. But the body is not  for harlotry, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

14.  And God [2also 3the 4Lord 1raised up], and will awaken us through  his power.

15. Do you not know that  your bodies [2members 3of Christ 1are]? Having taken then the members of the Christ, shall I make them [2of a harlot 1members]? May it not be.

16. Or do you not know that the one cleaving to the harlot, [2one 3body 1is]? [5shall be 1For 2he says 3The 4two] for [2flesh 1one].

17. But the one cleaving to the Lord [2one 3spirit 1is].

18. Flee  harlotry! Every sin which ever [2should commit 1a man 4outside 5of the 6body 3is], but the one committing harlotry [2against  3his own 4body 1sins].

19. Or do you not know that  your body [2a temple 3of the 6in 7you 4holy 5spirit 1is], which you have from God, and you are not your own?

20. For you were bought of value; glorify [2indeed  1God] in  your body, and in  your spirit! which is the one of God  

## 1 Corinthians 7

1.  Concerning Marriage But concerning what you wrote to me; It is good for a man [2a woman 1to not touch].

2. But because of the harlotries, [2each man  4his own 5wife 1let 3have], and [2each woman  4her own 5husband 1let 3have]!

3. [5to the 6wife 2the 3husband 7the 9owed 8good-will 1Let 4render], and in like manner also the wife to the husband!

4. The wife  [3her own 4body 1does not 2exercise authority over], but the husband. And in like manner also the husband [3his own 4body 1does not 2exercise authority over], but the wife.

5. Do not deprive one another, except for harmony's sake for a time, that you should relax in the fasting and  prayer! and again at the same time you should come together, that [2should not 3test 4you  1Satan] because of  your intemperance.

6. But this I say according to allowance, not according to command.

7. For I want all men to be as even myself; but each [2his own 3favor 1has] from God; one so, and another so.

8. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows; [2good 3for them 1it is] if they remain as even I.

9. But if they do not control themselves, let them marry! [3better 1For 2it is] to marry than to be set on fire.

10. And to the ones being married I exhort, not I, but the Lord, that a wife [3from 4a husband 1not 2separate].

11. But if even she should separate, let her remain unmarried, or [2to the 3husband 1be reconciled]! and a man's wife is not to be let go.

12. And to the rest I say, not the Lord; if any brother [3wife 1has 2an unbelieving], and she assents to live with him, he is not to leave her!

13. And a woman who has [2husband 1an unbelieving], and he assents to live with her, she is not to leave him!

14. [5is sanctified 1For  4husband 2the 3unbelieving] by the wife; and [4is sanctified  3wife 1the 2unbelieving] by the husband; since then  your children are unclean, but now it is holy.

15. But if the unbeliever separates, let him be separated! [3is not 4enslaved 1the 2brother], or the sister in  such cases. But in peace [2has called 3us  1God].

16. For what do you know, O wife, if [2the 3husband 1you shall deliver]? Or what do you know, O husband, if [2the 3wife 1you shall deliver]? 

17.  Abiding in the Call Except to each as God portioned, each as [3called 1the 2Lord] so walk! And so in [2the 3assemblies 1all] I set an order.

18. [3while being circumcised 1Who 2is called], let him not become uncircumcised! [3in 4uncircumcision 1Who 2is called], let him not be circumcised!

19.  Circumcision is nothing, and  uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is.

20. Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him abide!

21. A slave being called -- let it not be a care; but if even you are able [2free 1to be] rather -- use it!

22. For the [3in 4the Lord 2being called 1slave 7freedman 6the Lord's 5is]. In like manner also the free one being called, [3slave 1is 2Christ's].

23. With value you were bought; do not become slaves of men!

24. Each in which he was called, brethren, in this abide with God! 

25.  Concerning the Unmarried And concerning the virgins, [3a command 4of the Lord 1I do not 2have], but an opinion I give as one being shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy.

26. I think then this [2is good 1existing] because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man  so to be.

27. Have you been tied to a wife, do not seek a loosening! Have you been untied from a wife, do not seek a wife!

28. But if also you should marry, you sinned not; and if [3should have married 1the 2virgin] she did not sin; but affliction in the flesh [2shall have  1such]. But I spare you.

29. But this I say, brethren, the [2time 4wrapping up  1remaining 3is], that also the ones having wives, [2as 3not 4having 1should be].

30. And the ones weeping, as not weeping; and the ones rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and the ones buying, as not holding possessions.

31. And the ones dealing in this world, as not abusing it. [5passes by 1For 2the 3condition  4of this world].

32. But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he is pleasing to the Lord;

33. but the one married is anxious for the things of the world, how he pleases the wife.

34. [6are assigned a part 7even 1The 2wife 3and 4the 5virgin]. The unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy, both in body and in spirit; but she having married is anxious for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband.

35. But this for  your own advantage I speak, not that [2a noose 1I should put] around you, but [2to 3the 4decent 5and 6well-occupied thing 7with the 8Lord 1be undisturbed].

36. But if anyone [2to be disgraced 3over  4his virgin 1thinks], if she should be advanced in years, and so it ought to be what he wants to do, he does not sin; let them marry!

37. But the one who stands settled in the heart, not having necessity, [3authority 1but 2has] concerning his own will, and this he has judged in  his heart,  to give heed to  his own virgin, well he does.

38. So that also the one giving in marriage, [2well 1does]; and the one not giving in marriage, [2better 1does].

39. A wife is tied by law for as long a time [2lives  1as her husband]; but if [2should sleep  1her husband], she is free to whom she wants to marry, only in the Lord.

40. But more blessed is she if so she should remain, according to  my opinion; but I think I also [2spirit 3of God 1have].  

## 1 Corinthians 8

1.  Sensitivity to Conscience And concerning the things sacrificed to idols -- we know that [2all 3knowledge 1we have]. The knowledge inflates, but the love builds.

2. But if anyone thinks to know anything, nothing yet he knows as necessary to know.

3. But if anyone loves  God, this one is known by him.

4. Concerning the food then of the ones sacrificing to idols -- we know that [2is nothing 1an idol] in the world, and that there is no other God except one.

5. For even if indeed there are ones being called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth (as there are many gods, and many lords),

6. but to us there is one God the father, of whom  are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are  all things, and we by him.

7. But [3is not 4in 5all 1the 2knowledge]; but some  with conscience of the idol until just now [2as of a thing 3sacrificed to idols 1eat], and  their conscience being weak is tainted.

8. But a food [3us 1does not 2stand] before  God; for neither if we eat do we abound, nor if we do not eat do we lack.

9. But take heed, lest perhaps  [3authority 2your 1this] [2an occasion for stumbling 1becomes] to the ones being weak!

10. For if any should behold you, the one having knowledge, [2in 3the temple of an idol 1reclining], shall not  his conscience being weak be built up for  [2the things 3sacrificed to idols 1eating]?

11. And [3shall perish  2being weak 1the brother] over  your knowledge, for whom Christ died.

12. And thus sinning against the brethren, and striking their  conscience which is weakened, [2against 3Christ 1you sin].

13. Therefore if a food causes [2to stumble  1my brother], in no way shall I eat meats into the eon, that [2not  4my brother 1I should 3cause] to stumble.  

## 1 Corinthians 9

1.  The Rights of Apostleship Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? [2not 4Jesus 5Christ  6our Lord 1Have I 3seen]? [2not  3my work 1Are you] in the Lord?

2. If to others I am not an apostle, but indeed [2to you 1I am]; [3the 1for 4seal  5of my 6commission 2you are] in the Lord.

3.  My defense to the ones questioning me is this.

4. Do we not have authority to eat and to drink?

5. Do we not have authority [2a sister 3a wife 1to lead about], as also the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Or only I and Barnabas have not authority  to not work?

7. Who soldiers by his own rations at any time? Who plants a vineyard, and from the fruit of it does not eat? or who tends a flock, and from the milk of the flock does not eat?

8. Is it according to a man these things I speak, or does not also the law say these things?

9. For in the law of Moses it has been written, You shall not muzzle an ox threshing. Is not the ox a care  to God?

10. Or because of us assuredly it says? [2because of 3us 1For] it was written that, [5in 6hope 3ought 1The one 2plowing 4to plow], and the one threshing [4of the thing 5of his hope 3is to partake 1in 2hope].

11. If we [4to you 2the 3spiritual things 1sowed], is it a great thing if we [2your  3fleshly things 1harvest]?

12. If others [2of the 3authority 4over you 1partake], should not we more? But we did not use  this authority; but all things we hold off, that [2not 4any hindrance 1we should 3give] to the good news of the Christ.

13. Do you not know that the ones [6the 7consecrated things 1working 2at 3the 4temple 5shall eat]? and the ones [2the 3altar 1taking care of 5the 6altar 4receive a portion of]?

14. So also the Lord set in order for the ones [2the 3good news 1announcing], [2from the announcing 3of the 4good news 1to live].

15. But I [2none 1used] of these things. [2I did not 3write 1But] these things, that thus it should happen with me. For it is good for me rather to die than  [4my boasting 1that 2anyone 3should nullify].

16. For if I announce good news, there is not a boasting to me; for a necessity is pressed upon me; [3woe 1but 4to me 2it is] if I should not announce good news.

17. For if I willingly do this, [2a wage 1I have]; but if unwillingly, [2a management 1I am entrusted with].

18. What then to me is the wage? That announcing good news free I should establish the good news of the Christ, for the not abusing  my authority in the good news. 

19.  Serve All Men [3free 1For 2being] from all, to all [2myself 1I enslaved], that the many more I should gain.

20. And I became to the Jews as a Jew, that I should gain the Jews; to the ones under law, as under law, that the ones under law I should gain;

21. to the lawless ones, as a lawless one, (not being lawless to God, but lawful to Christ), that I should gain the lawless ones.

22. I became to the weak as weak, that the weak I should gain. To all these I have become all things, that assuredly some I should deliver.

23. But this I do on account of the good news, that [2a fellow-partaker with 3him 1I should become]. 

24.  Run to Win Do you not know that the ones [2in 3the stadium 1running], all indeed run, but one receives the victory prize? Thus you run that you should overtake!

25. But every one  struggling, in all things controls himself; that indeed then that a corruptible crown they should receive; but we an incorruptible crown.

26. I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so I box, as not [2the air 1flaying].

27. But I bruise my  body, and bring it into slavery, lest to others having proclaimed, myself [2debased 1I should be].  

## 1 Corinthians 10

1.  Israel a Model [2I do not 3want 1But] you to be ignorant, brethren, but know that  our fathers all [2under 3the 4cloud 1were], and all [2through 3the 4sea 1went],

2. and all unto  Moses were immersed in the cloud and in the sea,

3. and all [2the 3same 5food 4spiritual 1ate],

4. and all [2the 3same 5drink 4spiritual 1drank]; for they drank from a spiritual [2following 1rock], and the rock was the Christ.

5. But not with the most of them did [2think well of  1God]; for they were prostrated in the wilderness.

6. But these things [2models 3for us 1became], for  [2not 3to be 1us] cravers of evils, as those also were cravers.

7. Neither [2idolaters 1become], as some of them. As it has been written, [3sat down 1The 2people] to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

8. Neither should we commit harlotry, as some of them committed harlotry, and [3fell 4in 5one 6day 1twenty-three 2thousand].

9. Neither should we put to test the Christ, as also some of them tested, and by the serpents perished.

10. Neither grumble! as also some of them grumbled, and perished by the annihilator.

11. And these things all [3as models 1came to pass 2to them]; and they were written for our admonition, unto whom the ends of the eons are arrived.

12. So that the one thinking to stand, take heed lest he should fall!

13. A test [3you 1has not 2taken] except what belongs to a human; [3is trustworthy 1but  2God], who will not allow you to be tested above what you are able; but will make with the test also the way out,  [2to be able 1for you] to endure.

14. Therefore, my beloved, flee from the idolatry!

15. As practical I speak; you judge what I say!

16. The cup of the blessing which we bless, [2not 3fellowship 4of the 5blood 6of the 7Christ 1is it]? The bread which we break, [2not 3fellowship 4of the 5body 6of the 7Christ 1is it]?

17. For as one bread loaf, [4are one 5body 2the 3many 1we];  for [2all 4of 5the 6one 7bread loaf 1we 3partake].

18. Look at  Israel according to the flesh! [2not 3the ones 4eating 5the 6sacrifices 7partners 8of the 9altar 1Are]?

19. What then say I, that an idol is anything, or that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything?

20. But that which [3sacrifice 1the 2nations], [2to demons 1they sacrifice], and not to God; [2I do not 3want 1but] you [2partners 3of the 4demons 1to become].

21. You are not able to [2the cup 3of the Lord 1drink], and the cup of demons; you are not able [2of the table 3of the Lord 1to partake], and the table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke [3to jealousy 1the 2Lord]? Are [2stronger 3than he 1we]? 

23.  Do All Things unto the Glory of God All things to me are allowed, but not all things are advantageous. All things to me are allowed, but not all things build up.

24. [2no one  4of himself 1Let 3seek], but [2the thing 3of the 4other 1each].

25. Everything  in the market place being sold eat of! [2nothing 1questioning] on account of  conscience.

26. For of the Lord is the earth, and the fullness of it.

27. And if anyone invite you of the unbelieving ones, and you want to go, all  being placed near you eat of! [2nothing 1questioning] on account of  conscience.

28. But if anyone should say to you, This is sacrificed to idols, do not eat on account of that one, the one indicating and the conscience sake! For of the Lord is the earth, and the fullness of it.

29. But conscience, I say, is not the one of yourself, but the one of the other. For why is  my freedom judged by another's conscience?

30. If I [2favor 1partake in], why am I blasphemed for what I give thanks?

31. Whether then you eat, or whether you drink, or whether anything you do, [2all 3unto 4the glory 5of God 1do]!

32. [2not a cause for stumbling 1Become] -- even Jews, even Greeks, even the assembly  of God!

33. as even I [2all men 3in all things 1please], not seeking  for myself advantage, but the advantage for the many, that they should be delivered.  

## 1 Corinthians 11

1.  God's Order of Headship [2mimics 3of me 1Become], as even I of Christ!

2. But I praise you, brethren, that in all things you have remembrance of me. And [4as 5I delivered 6to you 2the 3traditions 1Hold].

3. But I want you to know, that [6of every 7man 4the 5head 1the 2Christ 3is]; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ  is God.

4. Every man praying or prophesying [2on 3his head 1having anything], disgraces  his own head.

5. And every woman praying or prophesying with uncovered  head, disgraces  her own head; [3one 1for 2it is] and the same as having been shaven.

6. For if [2be not 3covered up 1a woman], also let her be shorn! But if it be shameful for a woman  to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered up!

7. [3a man 2indeed 1For] ought not to be covered of the head, [2an image 3and 4glory 5of God 1being]. But a woman [2a glory 3of man 1is].

8. For not is man of the woman, but the woman of man.

9.  For [2was not 3created 1man] on account of the woman, but the woman on account of the man.

10. Because of this [3ought 1the 2woman 5the authority 4to have] upon  her head on account of the angels.

11. Furthermore neither is man separate from woman, nor woman separate from man in the Lord.

12. For as the woman is of the man, so also the man is through the woman;  but all things are of  God.

13. Among you yourselves judge! Is it becoming [2woman 1for an uncovered]  to pray to God?

14. Or does not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed if should have long hair, [2a dishonor 3to him 1it is]?

15. But a woman, if she should have long hair [2a glory 3to her 1is it]; for the hair of the head instead of a wrap is given to her.

16. But if anyone thinks to be contentious, we [3such 4a custom 1do not 2have], nor the assemblies  of God. 

17.  Conduct at the Lord's Supper But in this exhorting I do not praise you, for [2do not 4for 5the 6better 7but 8for 9the 10worse 1you 3come together].

18. [3first 2indeed 1For] in your coming together in assembly, I hear of splits [2among 3you 1existing], and partly I believe it.

19. For must [2even 4among 5you 1sects 3be], that the ones approved [2apparent 1should become] among you?

20. [2coming together 3then 1In your] in the same place, is it not [2the Lord's 3supper 1to eat]?

21. But each [2his own 3supper 1first takes] in the eating, and one hungers, and another is intoxicated.

22. For do [2houses 1you not have] for the eating and drinking? Or [2the 3assembly  4of God 1do you disdain], and disgrace the ones not having? What should I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise.

23. For I took from the Lord what also I delivered up to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up took bread;

24. and having given thanks he broke it, and said, Take eat, this is my  body  [2for 3you 1being broken]; this do in  my remembrance!

25. Likewise also the cup, after  having supper, saying, This  cup [2the 3new 4covenant 1is] in  my blood; this do as often as you should drink in  my remembrance!

26. For as often as you should eat  this bread, and  [2this cup 1should drink], the death of the Lord you announce until of which ever time he should come.

27. So that who ever should eat  this bread or should drink the cup of the Lord unworthily will be liable of the body and blood of the Lord.

28. [2let 4prove 1But 3a man] himself, and thus [2of 3the 4bread 1let him eat], and [2of 3the 4cup 1drink]!

29. For the one eating and drinking unworthily, [4judgment 5to himself 1eats 2and 3drinks], not discriminating the body of the Lord.

30. Because of this [2among 3you 1many] are weak and ill, and [2gone to sleep 1a fit amount].

31. For if [2ourselves 1we examine 4not  3we should] be judged.

32. But being judged by the Lord we are corrected, that [2not 4with 5the 6world 1we should 3be condemned].

33. So that, my brethren, coming together for the eating, [2one another 1let us look out for]!

34. But if anyone hungers, [2in 3his house 1let him eat]! that [2not 4for 5judgment 1you should 3come together]. And the rest whenever I should come I shall set in order.  

## 1 Corinthians 12

1.  Concerning the Divisions of the Spirituals But concerning the spirituals, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant.

2. You know that when you were nations, [2to 3the 5idols  4voiceless 6even as 7you were led 1being led away].

3. Therefore I make known to you, that no one [2in 3spirit 4of God 1speaking] says, Jesus is anathema; and no one is able to say, Lord Jesus, except by [2spirit 1holy].

4. But [2divisions 3of favors 1there are], but the same spirit;

5. and [2divisions 3of services 1there are], and the same Lord.

6. And [2divisions 3of operations 1there are], [3the 1but 4same 2it is] God, the one operating  all things in all.

7. And to each is given the open display of the spirit for  advantage.

8. For indeed one through the spirit is given word of wisdom; and to another word of knowledge, according to the same spirit.

9. And to another belief, in the same spirit; and to another favors of cures, in the same spirit;

10. and to another operations of powers; and to another prophecy; and to another distinction of spirits; and to another types of languages; and to another translation of languages.

11. But all these operate by the one and the same spirit, dividing privately to each as he wills. 

12.  One Body, Many Members For just as the body is one, and [3members 1has 2many], but all the members of the [2body  1one], being many, are one body; so also the Christ.

13. For also in one spirit we all in one body were immersed, whether Jews, whether Greeks, whether slaves, whether free; and all into one spirit given to drink.

14. For also the body is not one member, but many.

15. If [3should say 1the 2foot] that, I am not a hand, I am not of the body; it is not because of this it is not of the body.

16. And if [3should say 1the 2ear] that, I am not an eye, I am not of the body; it is not because of this it is not of the body.

17. If all the body was an eye, where would be the hearing? If all was hearing, where would be the smelling?

18. But now  God made the members, [2one 1each] of them in the body, as he wanted.

19. But if it was  all were one member, where the body?

20. But now there are many members indeed, but one body.

21. [3is not 4able 1And 2the eye] to say to the hand, [2need 3of you 1I have no]; or again the head to the feet, [2need 3of you 1I have no].

22. But more rather, the [4which seem 1members 2of the 3body 6weaker 5to be] are important;

23. and the ones which seem to be exceedingly without honor of the body, these [3honor 2more extra 1we invest]; and  [2indecent parts 1our 5decency 4more extra 3have];

24.  but [2decent parts 1our 4no 5need 3have]. But  God mixed together the body to the part lacking, [2more extra 1having given] honor,

25. that there might not be a split in the body, but [4the 5same 7for 8one another 3should have 6concern 1that the 2members].

26. And whether [3suffers 1one 2member], [4suffer along 1all 2the 3members]; whether [3be glorified 1one 2member], [4rejoice along 1all 2the 3members].

27. But you are the body of Christ, and members in turn.

28. And whom indeed [2appointed  1God] in the assembly, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, thereupon works of power, then favors of cures, assistance, guidance, types of languages.

29. Not all are apostles. Not all are prophets. Not all are teachers. Not all are works of power.

30. Not all [2favors 1have] of cures. Not all [2languages 1speak]. Not all interpret.

31. But be zealous for the [2favors  1better]. And yet [3that exceeds 2a way 1I will show to you].  

## 1 Corinthians 13

1.  The Preeminence of Love If [2the 3languages  4of men 1I speak] and of the angels, [4love 1but 3not 2I have], I have become brass resounding, or a cymbal sounding loudly.

2. And if I have prophecy, and I know the mysteries -- all, and all the knowledge; and if I have all the belief, so as [2mountains 1to remove], [3love 1but 2I have not], I am nothing.

3. And if I should distribute all  my possessions, and if I should deliver up  my body that it should be burned, [3love 1but 2I have not], not one benefit do I derive.

4. The love is lenient, is kind; the love is not jealous, the love is not rash, not inflated,

5. not indecent, does not seek the things for itself, is not provoked, does not consider the bad,

6. does not rejoice at the injustice, but rejoices with the truth.

7. All things it sustains, all things it trusts, all things it hopes, all things it endures.

8. The love at no time falls off. But whether prophecies, they shall cease work; whether languages, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall cease work.

9. [2in 3part 1But] we know, and in part we prophesy.

10. But whenever [3should come 1the 2perfect], then the thing in part shall cease work.

11. When I was an infant, as an infant I spoke, as an infant I thought, as an infant I considered; but when I became a man I ceased in the things of the infant.

12. For we see now by a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall recognize as also I was recognized.

13. But now abide belief, hope, love,  these three; but greater of these is the love.  

## 1 Corinthians 14

1.  Concerning Prophecy and Languages Pursue the love, and be zealous for the spirituals! but more that you should prophesy.

2. For the one speaking a language, [2not 3to men 1speaks], but  to God. For no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.

3. But the one prophesying, [2to men 1speaks] for edifying and comfort and consolation.

4. The one speaking a language edifies himself; but the one prophesying [2the assembly 1edifies].

5. But I want you all to speak languages, but more that you prophesy; for greater is the one prophesying, than the one speaking languages, outside of unless he interprets, that the assembly [2edification 1should receive].

6. And now, brethren, if I should come to you [2languages 1speaking], what shall I benefit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?

7. Even the lifeless things [2a sound 1giving], whether pipe, whether harp, if a distinction to the tones they should not give, how shall be known the thing piped, or the thing being harped?

8. For also if [3a concealed 4sound 1a trumpet 2should give], who shall make preparations for battle?

9. So also you through the tongue, if [2not 4a well-marked 5word 1you should 3give], how shall [3be known 1the thing 2being spoken], for you will be [2into 3air 1speaking].

10. [3so many 1Since 6by chance 4kinds 5of sounds 2there are] in the world, and none of them voiceless;

11. if then I do not know the ability of the sound, I will be to the one speaking a barbarian; and the one speaking with me a barbarian.

12. So also you, when you are zealous of spirits, [4for 5the 6edification 7of the 8assembly 1seek 2that 3you should abound]!

13. Therefore let the one speaking a language pray that he should interpret!

14. For if I should pray in a language,  my spirit prays,  but my intellect is unfruitful.

15. What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the intellect. I will strum praise with the spirit, but I will strum praise also with the intellect.

16. Since if you should bless with the spirit, the one filling the place of the common person, how shall he say the Amen at  your thanksgiving, since what you say he does not know?

17. [2you 3indeed 1For] well give thanks, but the other is not edified.

18. I give thanks to my God, [4than all 5of you 3more 2with languages 1speaking];

19. but in the assembly I want [2five 3words 4through  5my intellect 1to speak], that also others I should instruct, rather than ten thousand words in a language.

20. Brethren, [2not 3children 1be] in the senses, but  in evil act like infants, but in the senses [2complete 1become]!

21. In the law it has been written that, In other languages, and by [2lips 1other] I shall speak  to this people, and neither thus shall they listen to me, says the Lord.

22. So that the languages [2for 3a sign 1are], not to the ones believing, but to the unbelievers;  and prophecy is not to the unbelievers, but to the ones believing.

23. If then [4should come together 1the 3assembly 2entire] in one place, and all [2languages 1speak], and there should enter common people or unbelievers, shall they not say that you are maniacal?

24. And if all prophesy, and there should enter some unbeliever or common person, he is reproved by all, he is examined by all;

25. and thus the hidden things  of his heart [2open 1become]; and thus falling upon his face he does obeisance to  God, reporting that  God really [2among 3you 1is].

26. What then is it, brethren? Whenever you should come together, each of you [2a psalm 1has], [2a teaching 1has], [2a language 1has], [2a revelation 1has], [2a translation 1has]; [2all things 4for 5edification 1let 3be]!

27. Whether [3a language 1anyone 2speaks], let it be two or the most three, and by turn, and [2one 1let] interpret!

28. And if there should not be an interpreter, let him be quiet in the assembly, [3to himself 1and 2let him speak] and  to God!

29. And prophets, [2two 3or 4three 1let 5speak], and the others scrutinize!

30. But if to another [2it should be revealed 1sitting by], [2the 3first 1let] be quiet!

31. For you are able one by one all to prophesy, that all should learn and all should be comforted.

32. For spirits of prophets [2to prophets 1submit].

33. [3not 1For 2he is 6of commotion 4the 5God], but peace, as in all the assemblies of the holy ones.

34.  [2your women 3in 4the 5assemblies 1Let] be quiet! for it is not committed to their care to speak, but let them be submitted! as also the law says.

35. But if any [2to learn 1shall want], in the house, [2their own 3husbands 1let them ask]; [3shameful 1for 2it is] for women [2in 3assembly 1to speak].

36. Or [2from 3you 4the 5word  6of God 1came forth]? or to you alone it arrived?

37. If any thinks to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize what I write to you! that [3of the Lord 1they are 2commandments].

38. But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant!

39. So that, brethren, be jealous  to prophesy! and  to speak languages be not restrained!

40. All things decently and according to order let be!  

## 1 Corinthians 15

1.  The Good News But I make known to you, brethren, the good news which I announced as good news to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,

2. through which also you are being delivered, [3what 4word 5I announced as good news 6to you 1if 2you take control], outside of unless in vain you believed.

3. For I delivered up to you at first which also I received; that Christ died for  our sins according to the scriptures;

4. and that he was entombed, and that he was raised in the third day, according to the scriptures;

5. and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.

6. Thereupon he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also are fallen asleep.

7. Thereupon he appeared to James, then [2the 3apostles 1to all].

8. And last of all, just as if  to a miscarriage, he appeared also to me.

9. For I am the least of the apostles, who I am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly  of God.

10. But by favor of God I am what I am, and  his favor which was towards me has not [2empty 1become]; but more extra than them all I tire in labor; [2not 3I 1but], but the favor  of God  with me.

11. Whether then I, or whether they, so we proclaim and so you believed.

12. And if Christ is proclaimed, that from the dead he has been raised, how say some among you that [2a resurrection 3of the dead 1there is not]?

13. And if [2a resurrection 3of the dead 1there is not], not even Christ has been raised.

14. And if Christ has not been raised, [3is empty 1then  2our proclamation], and empty also is the belief of yours.

15. And we are found even as false witnesses  of God, for we witnessed concerning  God that he raised the Christ; whom he raised not, if indeed it is so the dead are not raised.

16. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.

17. And if Christ has not been raised, [4is in vain 1the 2belief 3of yours]; you are still in  your sins.

18. And then the ones having been fallen asleep in Christ perished.

19. If in  this life [3hoping 2we are 4in 5Christ 1only], more pitiable than all men are we.

20. But now Christ has been raised from the dead, [2first-fruit 3of the ones 4sleeping 1he became].

21. For since through man  death came, and through man there is resurrection of the dead.

22. For as in  Adam all die, so also in the Christ all shall be restored to life.

23. But each in  his own order; the first-fruit is Christ, thereupon the ones of the Christ at  his arrival.

24. Then the end, whenever he should have delivered up the kingdom to the God and father; whenever he should clear away all rule, and all authority, and power.

25. For it is necessary for him to reign until of which ever time he should have put all the enemies under  his feet.

26. The last enemy cleared away  is death.

27. For all things he subjected under  his feet. But whenever it should say that all things have been subjected, it is manifest that it is outside of the one subjecting to him all things.

28. And whenever [2should be subjected 3to him 1all things], then also he himself, the son, shall be subjected to the one having subjected to him all the things, that God should be the all in all.

29. Since what shall [6do 1the ones 2being immersed 3for 4the 5dead] if wholly the dead are not raised? Why also are they immersed for the dead?

30. Why also are we exposed to danger every hour?

31. Daily I die by  your boasting, which I have in Christ Jesus  our Lord.

32. If according to man I fought with wild beasts in Ephesus, what [2is it to me  1benefit] if the dead are not raised? We should eat and drink, for tomorrow we die?

33. Be not misled; [3corrupt 5morals 4gracious 2companionships 1evil].

34. Sober up righteously, and do not sin! [4an ignorance 1for 5of God 2some 3have] -- to your shame I speak. 

35.  A Glorious Body But someone will say, How are [3raised 1the 2dead]? and with what kind of body do they come?

36. Fool, what you sow is not restored to life unless it should die.

37. And what you sowed is not the body  coming to pass you sowed, but a bare kernel; if by chance grain or some of the rest;

38.  and God [2to it 1gives] a body as he wants, and to each of the seeds its own body.

39. Not every flesh is the same flesh, but indeed other flesh is of men, and another flesh of cattle, and another of fishes, and another of birds,

40. and [2bodies 1heavenly], and [2bodies 1earthly]. But another indeed is the [2of the 3heavenlies 1glory], and another is the ones of the earthly.

41. Another glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star from star differs in glory.

42. So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.

43. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.

44. It is sown [2body 1a physical], it is raised [2body 1a spiritual]. There is [2body 1a physical], and there is [2body 1a spiritual].

45. So also it has been written, [5became 1The 2first 3man 4Adam]  [2soul 1a living]; the last Adam into a spirit being restored to life.

46. But [3was not 4first 1the 2spiritual], but the physical; thereupon the spiritual.

47. The first man was from out of the earth, of dust; the second man, the Lord of heaven.

48. Such as the one of dust, such also the ones of dust; and such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones.

49. And as we wore the image  of dust, we shall wear also the image of the heavenly.

50. But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood [4the kingdom 5of God 3to inherit 1are not 2able], nor  can corruption  [2incorruptibility 1inherit].

51. Behold, [2a mystery 3to you 1I speak]; [4all 3indeed 2not 1we shall] sleep, but all shall be changed,

52. in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For it shall trump, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

53. For it is necessary  this corruption to put on incorruptibility, and  this mortal to put on immortality.

54. But whenever  this corruptible should have put on incorruptibility, and  this mortal should have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word  having been written, [2was swallowed down  1Death] in victory.

55. Where is your [2O death  1sting]? Where is your [2O Hades  1victory]?

56. And the sting  of death  is sin; and the power  of sin is the law.

57.  But to God be favor, to the one giving to us the victory through  our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. So that, [3brethren 1my 2beloved], [2settled 1be], immovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times! knowing that  your toil is not in vain in the Lord.  

## 1 Corinthians 16

1.  Concerning the Collection But concerning the collection, the one for the holy ones, as I set in order to the assemblies  of Galatia, so also you do!

2. According to one of the Sabbaths each of you by yourself put in! treasuring up what ever way he should be prospered in; that not whenever I come, then the collections should take place.

3. And whenever I should come, whom ever you should approve through letters, these I will send forth to carry away  your favor unto Jerusalem.

4. And if it should be worth  for me also to go, [2with 3me 1they shall go].

5. And I will come to you whenever I shall have gone through Macedonia; for Macedonia I do go through.

6. [2with 3you 1And] by chance I shall remain, or even pass the winter, that you should send me forward of which ever place I should go.

7. [2I do not 3want 1For 6you 4just now 7in 8passing 5to see]; but I hope for some time to remain with you, if the Lord commits it to my care.

8. But I shall remain in Ephesus until  Pentecost.

9. For a door opens to me great and active, and the ones acting as adversaries are many.

10. And if Timothy should come, see that fearlessly he should be with you! for the work of the Lord he works, as also I.

11. Not anyone then should treat him with contempt. But forward him in peace! that he should come to me; for I look out for him with the brethren.

12. And concerning Apollos the brother, much I appealed to him, that he should come to you with the brethren; and assuredly it was not his will that now he should come, but he will come whenever he should have an opportune time. 

13.  Final Exhortations Be vigilant! Stand firmly in the belief! Be manly! Be fortified!

14. [2all 3of you 5in 6love 1Let 4be]!

15. But I appeal to you, brethren, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is first-fruit  of Achaia, and [3for 4service 5to the 6holy ones 1they arranged 2themselves]),

16. that also you should submit  to such, and to every one  working together and tiring in labor.

17. And I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for the deficiency of yours these supplied.

18. For they rested  my spirit and the one of yours. Recognize then  such!

19. Greet the assemblies  of Asia! [4Greet 5you 7in 8the Lord 6much 1Aquila 2and 3Priscilla], with the [2in 3their house 1assembly].

20. [4greet 5you 2the 3brethren 1All]. Greet one another with [2kiss 1a holy]!

21. The greeting  by my hand, Paul.

22. If anyone is not fond of the Lord Jesus Christ, be anathema! Maranatha.

23. The favor of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

24.  My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
