# Mark

## Mark 1

1.  John the Baptist The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, son  of God.

2. As it has been written in the prophets, Behold, I send  my messenger before your face, who shall carefully prepare  your way before you.

3. A voice yelling in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord! [2straight 1Make]  his roads!

4. John came immersing in the wilderness, and proclaiming an immersion of repentance for a release of sins.

5. And went forth to him all the region of Judea, and the ones of Jerusalem, and all were immersed in the Jordan river by him, acknowledging  their sins.

6. [3was 1And 2John] clothed with hair of a camel, and a belt made of skin around  his loin, and eating locusts and [2honey 1wild]. 

7.  Jesus Immersed And he proclaimed, saying, There comes one more stronger than me after me, of whom I am not fit having bowed down to untie the strap  of his sandals.

8. I indeed immerse you in water; but he shall immerse you in [2spirit 1holy].

9. And it came to pass in those  days, Jesus came from Nazareth of the of Galilee, and he was immersed by John into the Jordan.

10. And immediately ascending from the water, he beheld the splitting of the heavens, and the spirit as a dove coming down upon him.

11. And a voice came from out of the heavens, saying, You are  my son the beloved, in whom I take pleasure. 

12.  Satan Tests Jesus And straightway the spirit cast him into the wilderness.

13. And he was there in the wilderness [2days 1forty] being tested by  Satan, and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels served to him.

14. And after the delivering up  John, Jesus came into the Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom  of God,

15. and saying, that, [3is fulfilled 1The 2time], and [4approaches 1the 2kingdom  3of God]; repent and believe in the good news! 

16.  Jesus Gathers His Disciples And walking by the sea of the of Galilee, he beheld Simon and Andrew  his brother casting a casting-net in the sea; for they were fishermen.

17. And [2said 3to them  1Jesus], Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

18. And immediately leaving  their nets, they followed him.

19. And having advanced from there a little, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John  his brother, and them in the boat readying the nets.

20. And immediately he called them. And having left  their father Zebedee in the boat with the hirelings, they went forth after him.

21. And they entered into Capernaum. And immediately on the Sabbaths having entered into the synagogue he taught.

22. And they were overwhelmed by  his teaching. For he was teaching them as [2authority 1one having], and not as the scribes. 

23.  Jesus Casts out the Unclean Spirit And there was in  their synagogue a man with [2spirit 1an unclean]; and he shouted aloud,

24. saying, Alas, what is it to us and to you, Jesus O Nazarene? Are you come to destroy us? I know you, who you are, the holy one  of God.

25. And [2gave reproach 3to him  1Jesus], saying, Be halted, and come forth from out of him!

26. And [4having thrown him into a spasm  3spirit 1the 2unclean], and having cried out [2voice 1with a great], came forth from out of him.

27. And all were distraught, so as to debate among themselves, saying, What is this? Whose  [2teaching  1new] is this, that with authority even to the [2spirits  1unclean] he gives orders, and they obey him?

28. And went forth the report of him straightway into all the place round about the Galilee.

29. And immediately from out of the synagogue having gone forth, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

30.  Jesus Heals Simon's Mother-in-law And the mother-in-law of Simon was reclining in a fever; and immediately they speak to him concerning her.

31. And having come forward he raised her, holding  her hand; and [4left 5her 1the 2fever 3immediately], and she served them.

32. And evening having become, when [3went down 1the 2sun], they brought to him all the ones [2illnesses 1having], and the ones being demon-possessed.

33. And the [2city 1entire] being assembled was at the door.

34. And he cured many [2illnesses 1having] of various diseases, and [2demons 1many] he cast out; and he did not allow [3to speak 1the 2demons], for they knew him.

35. And [3in the morning 4by night 2exceedingly 1having risen up] he departed, and he went forth unto a desolate place, and there prayed.

36. And [6pursued 7him  1Simon 2and 3the ones 4with 5him].

37. And having found him, they say to him that, All seek you.

38. And he says to them, We should lead on unto the places having small cities, that even there I should proclaim; [3for 4this 1for 2I have come forth].

39. And he was proclaiming among  their synagogues in all the Galilee, and [2the 3demons 1casting out]. 

40.  Jesus Heals the Leper And comes to him a leper enjoining him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him that, If you should want, you are able to cleanse me.

41. And Jesus, being moved with compassion, stretched out his hand and touched him, and says to him, I want, be cleansed!

42. And having spoken, immediately [3went forth 4from 5him 1the 2leprosy], and he was cleansed.

43. And having given strict charge to him, immediately he cast him away.

44. And he says to him, See that [3to anyone 2nothing 1you should say], but go [2yourself 1show] to the priest, and offer for  your cleansing what Moses assigned for a testimony to them!

45. But having gone forth, he began to proclaim many things, and to spread abroad the matter, so that no longer was he able [2openly 3into 4a city 1to enter]; but [2outside 3in 4deserted 5places 1he was]. And they came to him from every place.  

## Mark 2

1.  Jesus Heals a Paralytic And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was heard that [2in 3the house 1he is].

2. And immediately were gathered together many, so that they no longer had space, nor the places by the door. And he spoke to them the word.

3. And they come to him [2a paralytic 1bringing], being lifted by four men.

4. And not being able to draw near to him on account of the multitude, they unroofed the roof where he was. And having gouged it out, they let down the litter upon which the paralytic reclined.

5. [3beholding 1And  2Jesus]  their belief says to the paralytic, Son, [2have been forgiven 3you  1your sins].

6. [5were 1And 2some 3of the 4scribes 7there 6sitting down], and reasoning in  their hearts,

7. Why does this one thus speak blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except one --  God?

8. And immediately Jesus recognizing  in his spirit, that so they reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why do you reason these things in  your hearts?

9. What is easier to say to the paralytic? [3have been forgiven 4you 1The 2sins]; or to say, Arise, and lift your  litter, and walk!

10. But that you should know that [5authority 4has 1the 2son  3of man] to forgive [2upon 3the 4earth 1sins], he says to the paralytic,

11. To you I say, Arise, and lift  your litter, and go unto  your house!

12. And he arose immediately, and having lifted the litter, he went forth before all; so that all were amazed, and glorified  God, saying that, At no time we beheld thus.

13. And he went forth again by the sea; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them. 

14.  Jesus Reclines with Sinners And passing by, he beheld Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting down at the tax collector's station, and he says to him, Follow me! And having risen up he followed him.

15. And it came to pass in  his reclining in  his house, also many tax collectors and sinners reclined together with  Jesus and  his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him.

16. And the scribes and the Pharisees beholding him eating with the tax collectors and sinners said to his disciples, Why is it that with the tax collectors and sinners he eats and drinks?

17. And Jesus having heard says to them, No need have the ones being strong of a physician, but the ones [2illness 1having]. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

18. And [8were 1the 2disciples 3of John 4and 5the ones 6of the 7Pharisees] fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and the ones of the Pharisees fast,  but your disciples do not fast?

19. And [2said 3to them  1Jesus], Is it possible for the sons of the bridal chamber, in which the groom [2with 3them 1is], to fast? As much time [3with 1as they themselves 2have] the groom, they are not able to fast.

20. But will come days whenever [3should depart 4from 5them 1the 2groom], and then they shall fast in those  days.

21. And no one [2a piece of cloth 4rag 3of an unshrunk 1sews] upon [2garment 1an old]; otherwise, [2lifts  1its fullness] the new from the old, and [3worse 1the split 2becomes].

22. And no one casts [2wine 1new] into [2leather wine bags 1old]; otherwise, [4tears 1the 3wine  2new] the leather wine bags, and the wine pours out, and the leather wine bags are destroyed; but [2wine 1new 4into 6leather wine bags 5new 3is to be put]. 

23.  Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath And it came to pass that he passed on the Sabbath through the corn-fields, and [2began  1his disciples 4their way 3to make] while plucking the ears of corn.

24. And the Pharisees said to him, See! why do they do on the Sabbath which is not allowed?

25. And he said to them, At no time did you read what David did when [2need 1he had], and he hungered himself and the ones with him?

26. How he entered into the house  of God unto Abiathar the chief priest, and the bread loaves of the place setting he ate, which is not allowed to eat, unless to the priests; and he gave even to the ones [2with 3him 1being]?

27. And he said to them, The Sabbath on account  of man exists, not  man on account of the Sabbath.

28. So that [5is lord 1the 2son 3of 4man] also of the Sabbath.  

## Mark 3

1.  Jesus Heals on the Sabbath And he entered again into the synagogue. And [2was 3there 1a man 7being withered 4having 5the 6hand].

2. And they closely watched him, if on the Sabbaths he will cure him, that they should charge him.

3. And he says to the man, to the one [4being withered 1having 2the 3hand], Arise into the middle!

4. And he says to them, Is it allowed on the Sabbaths to do good or to do evil? [2a life 1to preserve] or to kill? And they kept silent.

5. And having looked round about them with anger, being grieved over the callousness  of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out  your hand! And he stretched it out, and [2was restored  1his hand] in health as the other.

6. And having gone forth, the Pharisees immediately with the Herodians [2council 1took] against him, how they should destroy him. 

7.  A Multitude Follows Jesus And  Jesus withdrew with  his disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from the Galilee followed him, and from  Judea,

8. and from Jerusalem, and from  Idumea, and on the other side of the Jordan, and the ones around Tyre and Sidon. [2multitude 1A great], having heard as much as he was doing, came to him.

9. And he spoke to his disciples that a small boat should attend constantly to him because of the multitude, that they should not squeeze him.

10. For many he cured; so as to fall upon him, that [4should touch him 1as many as 2had 3scourges].

11. And the [2spirits  1unclean], whenever they viewed him, fell at him, and cried out saying that, You are the son  of God.

12. And [3much 1he reproached 2them], that [2not 4him 5apparent 1they should 3make]. 

13.  Jesus Appoints the Twelve And he ascends into the mountain, and calls on whom he wants; and they went forth to him.

14. And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he should send them to proclaim,

15. and to have authority to cure the diseases, and to cast out the demons.

16. And he placed upon  Simon, the name Peter;

17. and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother  of James; and he placed upon them the names Boanerges, which is, sons of thunder.

18. And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

19. and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up. And they come to a house;

20. and comes together again a multitude so that [2are not 3able 1they] neither [2bread 1to eat].

21. And hearing, the ones of his come forth to seize him, for they said that, He is startled. 

22.  A House Divided And the scribes, the ones from Jerusalem, having come down said that, He has Beelzeboul; and that, By the ruler of the demons he cast out the demons.

23. And having called them, in parables he said to them, How is [2able 1Satan 4Satan 3to cast out]?

24. And if a kingdom against itself should be parted out, [2is not able 3to stand  1that kingdom].

25. And if a house against itself should be parted out, [2shall not be able 3to stand  1that house].

26. And if  Satan rose up against himself, and has been parted out, he is not able to stand, but [2end 1has an].

27.  [2is able 1No one]  [2the items 3of the 4strong man 5by entering 6into  7his house 1to plunder], if not first [2the 3strong man 1he should tie up], and then  his house he will plunder.

28. Amen I say to you that, All [2shall be forgiven  1sins] to the sons  of men, and blasphemies as many as they should have blasphemed;

29. but who ever should blaspheme against the [2spirit  1holy] has not forgiveness into the eon, but is liable to eternal judgment.

30. For they said, [3spirit 2an unclean 1He has].

31. Then come the brothers and  his mother, and [2outside 1standing] they sent to him, calling him.

32. And [2sat 1the multitude] around him, and they said to him, Behold,  your mother and  your brothers outside seek you.

33. And he answered to them, saying, Who is  my mother or  my brothers?

34. And having looked round about the ones [2around 3him 1sitting], he says, See!  my mother and  my brothers.

35. For who ever should do the will  of God, this one [2my brother 3and 4sister 5and 6mother 1is].  

## Mark 4

1.  The Parable of the Sower And again he began to teach by the sea. And was gathered together to him [2multitude 1a great], so that he having stepped into the boat, sat down in the sea; and all the multitude close to the sea [2upon 3the 4ground 1were].

2. And he taught them in parables many things, and said to them in  his teaching,

3. Hearken! Behold, went forth the one sowing  to sow.

4. And it came to pass in the sowing, some seed fell by the way, and [5came 1the 2birds 3of the 4heaven] and devoured it.

5. And other fell upon the rocky place, where it did not have [2earth 1much]; and immediately it rose up, because of the not having a depth of earth.

6. And the sun having arisen, it was scorched, and because of the not having root it was dried up.

7. And other fell into the thorns, and [3ascended 1the 2thorns], and choked it, and [2fruit 1it did not give].

8. And other fell into the [2earth  1good], and gave fruit ascending and growing; and [2bore 1one] thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.

9. And he said to them, The one having ears to hear, let him hear!

10. And when he was alone, they asked him, (the ones around him with the twelve,) the parable.

11. And he said to them, To you has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom  of God; but to those, to the ones outside, [3in 4parables 1all things 2happen].

12. That in seeing they should see, and not know; and in hearing they should hear, and not perceive; lest at any time they should turn, and [3should be forgiven 4them 1their 2sins].

13. And he says to them, Do you not know  this parable? and how [2all 3the 4parables 1shall you know]?

14. The one sowing [2the 3word 1sows].

15. And these are the ones by the way where [3is sown 1the 2word]; and whenever they hear, immediately comes  Satan and takes away the word, the one being sown in  their hearts.

16. And these are in like manner the ones upon the rocky places being sown; the ones whenever they should hear the word, immediately with joy they receive it;

17. and they do not have root in themselves, but are temporary; then when [2happens 1affliction] or persecution because of the word, immediately they are caused to stumble.

18. And these are the ones among the thorns being sown; the ones [2the 3word 1having heard],

19. and the anxieties  of this eon, and the deception of the riches, and  on account of the remaining desires entering in, they choke the word, and [2unfruitful 1it becomes].

20. And these are the ones [2upon 3the 5earth  4good 1having been sown]; the ones who hear the word, and welcome it, and bear fruit -- one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred. 

21.  A Lamp under a Bushel And he said to them, Does the lamp come out that [2under 3the 4bushel 1it should be put], or under the bed? Is it not that [2upon 3the 4lamp-stand 1it should be placed]?

22. For not is anything hidden which should not be made manifest, nor becomes concealed, but that [2into 3the open 1it should come].

23. If any has ears to hear let him hear!

24. And he said to them, Take heed what you hear! In what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you. And [3it shall be added 4to you 1to the ones 2hearing].

25. For who ever has, it shall be given to him; and the one who does not have, even what he has shall be taken from him. 

26.  The Parable of the Harvester And he said, Thus is the kingdom  of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the ground,

27. and should sleep, and should arise night and day, and the seed should burst forth, and should lengthen as [2not 1he knows].

28. For by itself the earth bears fruit; first the blade, then stalk, then the full grain in the stalk.

29. And whenever [3should be delivered up 1the 2fruit], immediately he sends the sickle, for [3stands by 1the 2harvest]. 

30.  The Parable of the Mustard Seed And he said, To what should we liken the kingdom  of God? or by what kind of parable shall we compare it?

31. As a kernel of mustard, which whenever it should be sown upon the ground [2lesser than 3all 4the 5seeds 1is] of the ones upon the earth.

32. And whenever it should be sown it ascends and becomes [2than all 3the 4vegetation 1greater], and produces [2branches 1great], so as to enable [5under  6its shade 1the 2birds  3of heaven 4to encamp].

33. And with such [2parables 1many] he spoke to them the word, as they were able to hear.

34. And without parables he did not speak to them. [2in 3private 1But 6to 7his disciples 4he explained 5all].

35. And he says to them in that  day, Evening becoming, we should go through unto the other side.

36. And letting go the multitude, they take him with themselves, as he was in the boat. But also other small boats were with him. 

37.  Jesus Calms the Tempest And comes a tempest [2wind 1of a great], and the waves put upon into the boat, so that it already was filling.

38. And he was himself at the stern upon the pillow sleeping. And they awaken him, and say to him, Teacher, is it not a care to you that we perish?

39. And having awakened, he gave reproach to the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent! Be halted! And [3abated 1the 2wind], and there became [2calm 1a great].

40. And he said to them, Why [3timid 1are you 2so]? How do you not have belief?

41. And they feared [2fear 1a great], and they said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?  

## Mark 5

1.  Jesus Heals the Gadarene Man And they came unto the other side of the sea, into the place of the Gadarenes.

2. And on his having come forth from out of the boat, immediately there met him from out of the tombs a man with [2spirit 1an unclean],

3. who  [2his dwelling 1had] in the tombs; and neither with chains no one was able to bind him;

4. for the reason he often with shackles and chains had been bound, and [3had been pulled apart 4by 5him 1the 2chains], and the shackles had been broken, and no one [3him 1was strong enough 2to tame].

5. And always, night and day, in the mountains, and in the tombs, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

6. And beholding  Jesus from far off, he ran and did obeisance to him.

7. And having cried out [2voice 1with a great] he said, What is it to me and to you, Jesus, O son of the [2God  1highest]? I adjure you  by God that you should not torment me.

8. For he said to him, Come forth, O [2spirit  1unclean] from out of the man!

9. And he asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, Legion is my name, for we are many.

10. And he appealed to him much, that [2not 4them 1he should 3send] outside the place. 

11.  Unclean Spirits Enter the Swine And was there by the mountains [2herd 3of swine 1a great] grazing.

12. And [4appealed to 5him 1all 2the 3demons], saying, Send us forth into the swine! that into them we should enter.

13. And [2committed 3them 4immediately  1Jesus]. And having come forth, the [2spirits  1unclean] entered into the swine. And [3advanced 1the 2herd] down the precipice into the sea, (and there were about two thousand;) and they drowned in the sea.

14. And the ones grazing the swine fled, and they announced in the city, and in the fields. And they came forth to behold what it is -- the thing taking place.

15. And they came to  Jesus; and viewing the demon-possessed sitting down and being dressed and being of a sound mind, the one having the legion; that they feared.

16. And [3described 4to them 1the ones 2beholding] how it happened to the one being demon-possessed, and concerning the swine.

17. And they began to appeal to him to go forth from  their borders.

18. And of his stepping into the boat, [3appealed to 4him 1the one 2having been demon-possessed] that he might be with him.

19. But Jesus would not allow him, but says to him, Go unto  your house to your own, and announce to them as much as [4to you 1the 2Lord 3did], and showed mercy on you!

20. And he went forth and began to proclaim in the Decapolis as much as [2did 3for him  1Jesus]; and all marveled.

21. And [2having passed through  1Jesus] in the boat again unto the other side, there was gathered together [2multitude 1a great] unto him; and he was by the sea.

22. And behold, there comes one of the chiefs of the synagogue, by name Jairus. And beholding him, he falls to  his feet,

23. and he appeals to him much, saying that,  My young daughter [2the last 1is next to]; that having come, you should place upon her your hands, so that she should be preserved, and she should live.

24. And he went forth with him; and [3followed 4him 2multitude 1a great], and squeezed together on him. 

25.  The Woman with a Flow of Blood And a certain woman being with a flow of blood [2years 1twelve],

26. and [2much 1suffering] under many physicians, and having spent the things of hers -- all, and not deriving benefit, but rather [2to 3the 4worse 1having come];

27. she having heard concerning  Jesus, having come among the multitude behind, touched  his cloak;

28. for she said that, If only  [2his garments 1I should touch], I shall be delivered.

29. And immediately was dried the spring  of her blood, and she knew in her body that she was healed from the scourge.

30. And immediately  Jesus realizing in himself the [3from out of 4him 1power 2went forth], having turned among the multitude, he said, Who touched my  garments?

31. And [2said 3to him  1his disciples], You see the multitude squeezing you, and you say, Who touched me?

32. And he looked round about to behold the one doing this.

33. And the woman being fearful and trembling, knowing what has happened to her, came and fell at him, and told him all the truth.

34.  And he said to her, O daughter, the belief of yours has delivered you, go in peace, and be in health from  your scourge! 

35.  The Young Woman Restored to Life While he was speaking, they came from the chief of the synagogue, saying that,  Your daughter died, why yet inconvenience the teacher?

36. But Jesus immediately having heard the word being spoken, says to the chief of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe!

37. And he did not allow anyone to follow together with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

38. And he comes unto the house of the chief of the synagogue, and he views a tumult, and weeping and [2shouting 1much].

39. And having entered he says to them, Why make a disruption and weep? the child died not, but sleeps.

40. And they ridiculed him. But casting out all, he takes to himself the father of the child, and the mother, and the ones with him, and enters where [3was 1the 2child] reclining.

41. And holding the hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha cumi! which is being translated,  Young woman, to you I say, Arise!

42. And immediately [3arose 1the 2young woman], and walked, for she was [2years old 1twelve]. And they were amazed [2astonishment 1with great].

43. And he warned them much that no one should know this; and he said to give to her to eat.  

## Mark 6

1.  Jesus is Questioned in His Fatherland And he came forth from there, and went into  his fatherland; and [2followed 3him  1his disciples].

2. And [2taking place 1the Sabbath], he began [2in 3the 4synagogue 1to teach]; and many hearing were overwhelmed, saying, From where did this one receive these things? And, What  wisdom  having been given to him, that even [2power 1such 4through  5his hands 3takes place]?

3. [2this not 1Is] the son of the fabricator, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judah, and Simon? And are not  his sisters here with us? And they were stumbled by him.

4. [3said 1And 4to them  2Jesus] that, [2is not 1A prophet] without honor except in  his fatherland, and among the relatives, and in  his own house.

5. And he was not able [2there 3not even one 4powerful work 1to do], except to a few ill ones, having placed [3upon 1the 2hands], he cured them.

6. And he marveled because of  their unbelief. And he led about the towns round about, teaching. 

7.  Jesus Sends the Twelve Two by Two And he calls on the twelve, and begins to send them two by two; and he gave to them authority of the [2spirits  1unclean].

8. And he made exhortation to them that [2nothing 1they should carry] in the way, except a rod only -- no provision bag, no bread, no [2in 3the 4belt 1brass coin];

9. but [2being tied on 1sandals]; and not putting on two inner garments.

10. And he said to them, Where ever you should enter into a house, there abide until whenever you should come forth from there!

11. And as many as should not receive you, nor should hear you, in going forth from there, you shake off the dust  underneath  your feet for a testimony to them! Amen I say to you, More endurable it will be for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than  that city.

12. And having come forth, they proclaimed that they should repent.

13. And [3demons 2many 1they cast out], and they anointed [3with oil 1many 2ill ones], and they cured. 

14.  Herod Beheads John the Baptist And [3heard  1king 2Herod], [4open 1for 3became  2his name]. And he said that, John, the one immersing, [2from 3the dead 1is arisen], and because of this [3operate 1the 2works of power] in him.

15. Others said that, He is Elijah. And others said that, He is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.

16. And having heard,  Herod said that, [2whom 3I 4beheaded 1John], this is he; he was arisen from the dead.

17. For he,  Herod, having sent, seized  John, and bound him in the prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip  his brother; for he married her.

18. [3said 1For 2John]  to Herod that, It is not allowed to you to have the wife  of your brother.

19.  But Herodias held it against him, and wanted to kill him; and was not able.

20.  For Herod feared  John, knowing him [4man 1as a righteous 2and 3holy], and he preserved him. And having heard of him, [2many things 1he did], and with pleasure heard him.

21. And [3having become 2day 1an opportune], when Herod  [3for his birthday 2a supper 1made] to his great men, and to the commanders of thousands, and to the first ones  of Galilee;

22. and [2having entered  1her daughter], the one of Herodias, and dancing, and pleasing  Herod, and the ones reclining together with him, [3said 1the 2king] to the young woman, Ask me what ever you should want, and I will give it to you!

23. And he swore by an oath to her that, What ever [2me 1you should ask], I will give to you, unto half  of my kingdom.

24. And she having gone forth said  to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the baptist.

25. And having entered immediately with haste to the king, she asked saying, I want that you give to me immediately upon a platter the head of John the baptist.

26. And [4dejected 3being 1the 2king] because of the oaths, and of the ones reclining together with him, did not want to disregard her.

27. And [3immediately 4having sent 1the 2king] a guard, gave orders [2to be brought  1for his head]. And having gone forth he beheaded him in the prison.

28. And he brought  his head upon a platter, and he gave it to the young woman. And the young woman gave it  to her mother.

29. And having heard,  his disciples came and lifted  his corpse, and put it in the tomb.

30. And [3gathered together 1the 2apostles] to  Jesus, and they reported to him all, even as much as they did, and as much as they taught.

31. And he said to them, You come by yourselves in private unto a desolate place, and rest a little! [7were 1For 2the ones 3coming 4and 5the ones 6going] many; and not even [2to eat 1did they have an opportune time].

32. And he went forth unto a desolate place in the boat in private.

33. And they beheld them going away, and [2recognized 3him 1many], and [3on foot 4from 5all 6the 7cities 1they ran together 2there], and they went forth, and came together to him.

34. And having come forth, [2beheld  1Jesus] a great multitude, and he was moved with compassion over them, for they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. 

35.  Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand And already the hour [2great 1having been], [2having come forward 3to him  1his disciples], say that, It is a desolate  place, and already [2hour 1it is a great].

36. Dismiss them! that having gone forth into the [2round about 1fields], and towns, they should buy to themselves bread loaves; [3anything 1for 4they shall eat 2they do not have].

37. And he answering said to them, You give to them yourselves something to eat! And they say to him, Having gone forth should we buy two hundred denarii of bread loaves, and should we give to them to eat?

38. And he says to them, How many bread loaves do you have? Go and see! And having known, they say, Five and two fishes.

39. And he gave orders to them to lie all down, parties by parties, upon the green grass.

40. And they reclined, plot by plot, by hundreds, and by fifties.

41. And having taken the five bread loaves and the two fishes, having looked up into the heaven, he blessed. And he broke off in pieces of the bread loaves, and he gave to his disciples, that they should place near to them; and the two fishes he portioned to all.

42. And all ate, and were filled.

43. And they took up [4of pieces 1twelve 2hampers 3full], and of the fishes.

44. And [5were 1the ones 2having eaten 3of the 4bread loaves] about five thousand men. 

45.  Jesus Walks on the Sea And immediately he compelled  his disciples to step into the boat, and to lead to the other side to Bethsaida, until he should dismiss the multitude.

46. And having dismissed them, he went forth into the mountain to pray.

47. And [2evening 1having become], [3was 1the 2boat] in the middle of the sea, and he was alone upon the land.

48. And he beheld them being tormented in the rowing; [4was 1for 2the 3wind] opposite them. And around the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking upon the sea, and he wanted to go by them.

49. And they beholding him walking upon the sea, thought it to be a phantom, and they shouted aloud.

50. For all beheld him, and were disturbed. And immediately he spoke with them, and he says to them, Take courage, I am he, do not fear!

51. And he ascended to them into the boat; and [3abated 1the 2wind]. And exceedingly beyond extra [4among 5themselves 1they were amazed 2and 3marveled].

52. For they did not perceive concerning the bread loaves; [3was 1for  2their heart] calloused. 

53.  Jesus Heals at Gennesaret And having passed through, they came unto the land of Gennesaret, and were moored.

54. And on their coming forth from out of the boat, immediately having recognized him,

55. [2running 1all]  round about that place, they began [2upon 3the 4litters 5the ones 7illnesses 6having 1to carry round about], where they were hearing that, He is there.

56. And where ever he entered into towns or cities or fields, [4in 5the 6markets 1they put 2the ones 3being invalid]; and they appealed to him that if only [2the 3decorative hem  4of his cloak 1they could just touch]; and as many as touched him were delivered.  

## Mark 7

1.  Jesus Questioned by the Pharisees and Scribes And gathered together to him the Pharisees and some from the scribes, having come from Jerusalem.

2. And they beholding certain ones  of his disciples with common hands, that is to say unwashed, eating bread, they complained;

3. for the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless [3with a fist 1they washed  2hands] they do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders.

4. And coming from markets, if they should not immerse, they do not eat; and [2other things 1many] there are which they take on themselves to hold -- immersion of cups, and quart pitchers, and brass kettles, and beds.

5. Thereupon [6asked 7him 1the 2Pharisees 3and 4the 5scribes], Why  do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but with unwashed hands they eat the bread?

6. And he answering said to them that, Well Isaiah prophesied concerning you the hypocrites, as it has been written, This  people [2with the 3lip 1esteem me],  but their heart is far off at a distance from me.

7. And in vain they worship me, teaching as instructions the precepts of men.

8. For leaving the commandment  of God, you hold the tradition  of men -- immersions of quart pitchers and cups, and [2other 3similar 4such things 1many] you do.

9. And he said to them, Well you annul the commandment  of God, that  [2your tradition 1you give heed to].

10. For Moses said, Esteem  your father and  your mother! And, Let the one speaking evil of father or mother [2in death 1come to an end]!

11. But you say, If [2should say 1a man] to a father or to a mother, Corban, (which is a gift offering) what ever of me you should derive benefit.

12. And no longer you allow him [2anything 1to do] to his father or to his mother,

13. voiding the word  of God  by your tradition which you delivered; and [2similar 3such things 1many] you do. 

14.  Defilement Comes from Within And having called all the multitude, he said to them, Hear me all, and perceive!

15. There is nothing from outside  of man entering into him which is able to make him unclean; but the things going forth from him, those are the things making [3unclean 1the 2man].

16. If any has ears to hear let him hear!

17. And when he entered into a house from the multitude, [2asked 3him  1his disciples] concerning the parable.

18. And he says to them, Thus also you are senseless? Do you not comprehend that everything  from outside entering into  a man is not able to make him unclean.

19. For it enters not into his  heart, but into the belly; and into the bowel it goes forth, cleansing all the foods.

20. And he said that, The thing [2from out of 3the 4man 1going forth], that defiles the man.

21. For from inside out of the heart  of men  [3thoughts  2evil 1goes forth], adulteries, harlotries, murders,

22. frauds, desires for wealth, wickednesses, treachery, lewdness, [2eye 1a wicked], blasphemy, pride, folly.

23. All these  evils from inside go forth and defile the man. 

24.  The Belief of the Greek Woman And from there having risen up, he went forth into the boundaries of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into the house, [2no one 1wanting] to know, but he was not able to be unaware.

25. [3having heard 1For 2a woman] about him, of which [3had  2young daughter 1her 5spirit 4an unclean], having come fell at  his feet.

26. [4was 1And 2the 3woman] a Greek, Syro-phoenician  by race, and she asked him that [2the 3demon 1he should cast out] from  her daughter.

27. And Jesus said to her, Allow [3first 4to be filled 1the 2children]! [3not 1for 4good 2it is] to take the bread of the children, and to throw it to the little dogs.

28. And she answered and says to him, Yes, O Lord, but even the little dogs underneath the table eat from the crumbs of the children.

29. And he said to her, On account of this  word, go! [3has come forth 1the 2demon] from out of  your daughter.

30. And having gone forth unto  her house, she found the demon having gone forth, and the daughter being laid upon the bed. 

31.  Jesus Heals the Deaf Mute And again having come forth from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of the Galilee, in the midst of the borders of Decapolis.

32. And they bring to him a deaf-mute stammering. And they appeal to him that he should place upon him his hand.

33. And taking him away from the multitude in private, he put  his fingers into  his ears, and having spit touched  his tongue.

34. And having looked up into the heaven, he moaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened wide!

35. And immediately were opened wide his  hearing faculties, and [4was untied 1the 2bond  3of his tongue], and he spoke rightly.

36. And he warned them that [2to no one 1they should speak]. But as much as he warned them, rather more extra they proclaimed.

37. And more exceedingly they were overwhelmed, saying, [2all things well 1He has done]. Both the deaf he makes to hear, and the speechless to speak.  

## Mark 8

1.  Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand In those  days, a very great multitude being, and not having anything to eat, Jesus having called  his disciples, says to them,

2. I am moved with compassion over the multitude, for already [2days 1three] they remain with me, and they do not have anything to eat.

3. And if I should release them hungry from fasting unto their house, they shall be fainting in the way; for some of them [2from far off 1have come].

4. And [2answered 3him  1his disciples], From what place [3of these 1shall 5be able 2any 4here] to fill of bread in a desolate place?

5. And he asked them, How many [2do you have 1bread loaves]? And they said, Seven.

6. And he exhorted the multitude to recline upon the ground. And having taken the seven bread loaves, having given thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples, that they should place it near them; and they placed it near the multitude.

7. And they had [2small fishes 1a few]; and having blessed, he said to place [2near 3also 1them].

8. And they ate, and were filled. And they lifted up an abundance of pieces -- seven small baskets.

9. [4were 1And 2the ones 3eating] about four thousand; and he dismissed them.

10. And immediately having stepped into the boat with  his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha. 

11.  The Pharisees Seek a Sign And came forth the Pharisees, and they began to debate with him, seeking from him a sign from the heaven, testing him.

12. And having groaned in his spirit, he says, Why  does this generation [2for a sign 1seek anxiously]? Amen I say to you, Shall [2be given  3to this generation 1a sign], no.

13. And having left them, [2having stepped 1again] into the boat, he went forth unto the other side.

14. And they forgot to take bread loaves; and except for one bread loaf, they did not have any with themselves in the boat.

15. And he warned them saying, See! take heed of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!

16. And they reasoned with one another, saying that, [2bread loaves 1We have no].

17. And knowing,  Jesus says to them, Why do you reason that [2bread loaves 1you have no]? Not yet do you comprehend, nor perceive? [2still 5being calloused 1Do you 3have  4your heart]?

18. [2eyes 1Having], do you not see? And ears having, do you not hear? And do you not remember?

19. When the five bread loaves I broke for the five thousand, how many hampers full of pieces did you lift? They say to him, Twelve.

20. And when the seven for the four thousand, how many small baskets full of pieces did you lift? And they said, Seven.

21. And he said to them, How do you not perceive? 

22.  Jesus Heals the Blind Man And he comes into Bethsaida; and they bring to him a blind man, and they appeal to him that he should touch him.

23. And taking hold of the hand of the blind man, he led him outside of the town; and having spit into  his eyes, having placed his hands to him, he asks him if anything he sees.

24. And having looked up he said, I see  men as trees, walking.

25. Then again he placed the hands upon  his eyes, and he made him to look up. And he was restored, and he looked clearly on all.

26. And he sent him unto  his house, saying, Neither into the town should you enter, nor should you speak to any in the town. 

27.  Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ And Jesus went forth, and  his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea, the one of Philippi. And in the way he asks  his disciples, saying to them, Who [3me 2say  1do men] to be?

28. And they answered, John the Baptist; and others Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.

29. And he says to them, And you, whom do you say me to be? And answering  Peter says to him, You are the Christ.

30. And he gave reproach to them that to no one they should tell concerning him. 

31.  Jesus Foretells His Death And he began to teach them that it is necessary for the son  of man [2many things 1to suffer], and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise up.

32. And in an open manner [2the 3matter 1he spoke]. And [2taking him to himself  1Peter] began to reproach him.

33. And he turned. And beholding  his disciples he reproached  Peter, saying, Go behind me satan! for you do not think the things  of God, but the things  of men. 

34.  The Cost of Following Jesus And having called the multitude with  his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wants [2after 3me 1to come], let him totally reject himself, and lift  his cross, and follow me!

35. For who ever should want  [2his life 1to preserve] shall lose it; and who ever should lose  his life because of me and of the good news, this one will preserve it.

36. For what will it benefit a man, if he should gain the [2world 1whole], and suffer loss  of his soul?

37. Or what shall [2give 1a man] as a bargain  for his soul?

38. For who ever should be ashamed of me and  of my words in  [5generation 1this  2adulterous 3and 4sinful], even the son  of man shall be ashamed of him, whenever he should come in the glory  of his father with the [2angels  1holy].  

## Mark 9

1.  The Transformation of Jesus And he said to them, Amen I say to you that, There are some of the ones here standing, the ones who in no way shall taste of death, until whenever they should behold the kingdom  of God coming in power.

2. And after [2days 1six] Jesus took to himself  Peter, and  James, and  John, and brought them into [2mountain 1a high] in private alone. And he was transformed in front of them.

3. And  his garments became shining, [2white 1exceedingly] as snow, such as a fuller upon the earth is not able to whiten.

4. And [4appeared to them 1Elijah 2with 3Moses], and they were conversing together  with Jesus.

5. And responding  Peter says  to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and we should make [2tents 1three]; for you one, and Moses one, and Elijah one;

6. [3not 1for 2he knew] what he shall speak, for they were frightened.

7. And there became a cloud overshadowing them; and came a voice from out of the cloud, saying, This is  my son the beloved, hear him!

8. And suddenly having looked round about, no longer [2anyone 1they beheld], but  Jesus alone with themselves.

9. [3going down 1And 2of their] from the mountain, he gave warning to them that to no one should they describe what they saw, except whenever the son  of man [2from 3the dead 1should be raised up].

10. And the matter they kept to themselves, debating what is the thing -- [2from 3the dead 1to rise up]?

11. And they asked him, saying that, [3say 1The 2scribes] that it is necessary for Elijah to come first.

12. And he answering said to them, Elijah indeed having come first restores all things; and how it has been written about the son  of man, that many things he should suffer, and should be treated with contempt.

13. And I say to you, that also Elijah has come, and they did to him as much as they wanted, as it was written of him.

14. And having come to the disciples, he beheld [2multitude 1a great] around them, and scribes debating with them.

15. And immediately all the multitude beholding him were astonished, and were running up to greet him. 

16.  Jesus Casts out the Unclean Spirit And he asked the scribes, What do you debate with them?

17. And answering one from out of the multitude said, Teacher, I brought  my son to you, having [2spirit 1a speechless].

18. And where ever he should be overtaken it tears him, and he foams, and grinds  his teeth, and he withers. And I spoke to your disciples that they should cast it out, and they prevailed not.

19. And answering to him, he says, O [2generation 1unbelieving], for how long [2to 3you 1will I be]? For how long shall I endure you? Bring him to me!

20. And they brought him to him. And beholding him, immediately the spirit threw him into a spasm; and having fallen upon the ground he rolled foaming.

21. And he asked  his father, How long a time is it that this has happened to him? And he said, From childhood.

22. And often [2him 3both 4into 5the fire 1it threw] and into waters, that it should destroy him; but if any way you are able, help us! be moved with compassion upon us!

23. And Jesus said to him, The thing, if you are able to believe-- all things are possible to the one trusting.

24. And immediately [5crying out 1the 2father 3of the 4child] with tears said, I believe, O Lord, help my  unbelief!

25. [3beholding 1And  2Jesus] that [2ran together 1the multitude], he reproached the [2spirit  1unclean], saying to it, O spirit,  speechless and mute, I give orders to you, Come forth out of him! and no longer should you enter into him.

26. And having cried out, and greatly throwing him into a spasm, it came forth; and he became as dead; so as for many to say that he died.

27. And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he rose up.

28. And in his entering into the house,  his disciples responded to him in private that, We were not able to cast it out

29. And he said to them, This  kind by nothing is able to come forth, except by prayer and fasting.

30. And from there having gone forth they passed through  Galilee, and he did not want that any should know.

31. For he taught  his disciples, and said to them that, The son  of man is delivered up unto the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, the third day he shall rise up.

32. But they knew not the saying, and feared to ask him. 

33.  Servanthood And he came into Capernaum. And [2in 3the 4house 1being] he asked them, What [2in 3the 4way 5among 6yourselves 1were you reasoning]?

34. And they were silent; [2with 3one another 1for] they were reasoning in the way, who was greater.

35. And sitting down, he called the twelve, and he says to them, If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.

36. And having taken a child, he set it in the midst of them; and having embraced it, he said to them,

37. Who ever [2one  3of such 4children 1should receive] in  my name, receives me; and who ever should receive me, [2not 3me 1receives], but the one having sent me.

38. [3responded 1And 4to him  2John], saying, Teacher, we beheld a certain one  in your name casting out demons, who does not follow us; and we restrained him, for he does not follow us.

39. And Jesus said, Do not restrain him! [3no one 1For 2there is] who shall do a work of power in  my name, and be able to quickly speak evil of me.

40. For he who is not against us, [2for 3us 1is].

41. For who ever should give you a drink of a cup of water in  my name, for you are of Christ, amen I say to you, in no way should he lose  his wage.

42. And whoever should cause to stumble one of the little ones  trusting in me, [2good 1it is] to him rather if [3encompass 2stone 1a mill] around  his neck, and to be thrown into the sea.

43. And if [2should cause you to stumble  1your hand], cut it off! [2good 3to you 1It is 5crippled 6into  7life 4to enter], rather than  [2two 3hands 1having] to go forth into  Gehenna, into the [2fire  1inextinguishable],

44. where  their worm does not come to an end, and the fire is not extinguished.

45. And if  your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off! [2good 1It is] to you to enter into  life lame, rather than  [2two 3feet 1having] to be thrown into  Gehenna, into the [2fire  1inextinguishable],

46. where  their worm does not come to an end, and the fire is not extinguished.

47. And if  your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out! [2good 3to you 1For it is] [2one-eyed 1to enter] into the kingdom  of God, rather than [2two 3eyes 1having] to be thrown into the Gehenna  of fire,

48. where  their worm does not come to an end, and the fire is not extinguished.

49. For all [2with fire 1shall be salted], and every sacrifice [2with salt 1shall be salted].

50. [3is good 1The 2salt]; but if the salt [2insipid 1becomes], by what means shall you season? Have [2in 3yourselves 1salt], and make peace with one another!  

## Mark 10

1.  Jesus Teaches on Marriage and Divorce And from there, rising up he comes unto the borders  of Judea, by the other side of the Jordan. And [2went 3again 1multitudes] to him; and as he was accustomed, again he taught them.

2. And coming forward, Pharisees asked him, Is it allowed for a man [2a wife 1to dismiss]? testing him.

3. And answering he said to them, What did [2to you 1Moses give charge]?

4. And they said, Moses committed to one's care [2a scroll 3of divorce 1to write] and to dismiss.

5. And answering  Jesus said to them, Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote to you  this commandment.

6. But from the beginning of creation [4male 5and 6female 2made 3them  1God].

7. Because of this [2shall leave 1a man]  his father and  mother, and shall be cleaved to  his wife;

8. and [3will be 1the 2two] for [2flesh 1one]. So that no longer are they two, but one flesh.

9. What then  God yoked together, let not man separate!

10. And in the house again  his disciples concerning the same asked him.

11. And he says to them, Who ever should dismiss  his wife, and should marry another, commits adultery against her.

12. And if a wife should dismiss  her husband, and should marry another, she commits adultery. 

13.  Jesus Embraces the Children And they brought to him children, that he should touch them;  but the disciples gave reproach to the ones bringing them.

14. And having beheld,  Jesus was indignant, and said to them, Allow the children to come to me, and do not restrain them! for of the ones such is the kingdom  of God.

15. Amen I say to you, Who ever should not receive the kingdom  of God as a child, in no way shall he enter into it.

16. And having embraced them, having put his hands upon them, he blessed them. 

17.  A Rich Man Questions Jesus And in his going forth into the way, [2running up 1one] and kneeling at him, asked him, [2teacher 1Good], what shall I do that [3life 2eternal 1I should inherit]?

18. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except one --  God.

19. The commandments you know, do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not witness falsely, do not wrong, esteem  your father and  mother!

20. And he answering said to him, Teacher, these things all I kept from my youth.

21.  And Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, One thing to you is lacking, Go, as much as you have sell, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven! And come follow me, taking up the cross!

22. But he being gloomy over the word went forth fretting; for he was holding [2possessions 1many].

23. And looking round about,  Jesus says to his disciples, How with difficulty the ones  [2things 1having] [2into 3the 4kingdom  5of God 1shall enter].

24. And the disciples were distraught at  his words. And Jesus again responding says to them, Sons, how difficult it is for the ones yielding upon  things [2into 3the 4kingdom  5of God 1to enter].

25. It is easier for a camel [2through 3the 4hole 5made by an awl 1to enter], than a rich person [2into 3the 4kingdom  5of God 1to enter].

26. And they were extremely overwhelmed, saying to themselves, And who is able to be delivered? 

27.  With God All Things Are Possible And looking at them,  Jesus says, With men impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with  God.

28. And Peter began to say to him, Behold, we left all and followed you.

29. And answering  Jesus said, Amen I say to you, There is no one who left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, because of me and the good news,

30. that should not receive a hundred fold now in  this time -- houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and fields, with persecutions, and in the [2eon  1coming] life eternal.

31. But many first will be last, and the last first. 

32.  Jesus Foretells His Death And they were in the way, ascending into Jerusalem; and [2was 3leading before 4them  1Jesus]. And they were distraught; and following, they were afraid. And having taken to himself again the twelve, he began to speak to them the things about to come to pass to him.

33. For behold, we ascend into Jerusalem, and the son  of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests, and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and they will deliver him up to the nations.

34. And they shall mock him, and they shall whip him, and they shall spit on him, and they shall kill him. And in the third day he will rise up. 

35.  James and John's Request And going to him, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying, Teacher, we want that what ever we should ask you should do for us.

36. And he said to them, What do you want me to do for you?

37. And they said to him, Give us that one at your right, and one at your left, should sit in  your glory.

38. And Jesus said to them, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, and the immersion which I am immersed with to be immersed?

39. And they said to him, We are able. But Jesus said to them, The cup indeed which I drink, you shall drink; and the immersion which I am immersed, you shall be immersed.

40. But the sitting at my right and at my left, it is not mine to give, but to ones whom it has been prepared.

41. And hearing the ten began to be indignant on account of James and John.

42. But Jesus having called them, says to them, You know that the ones seeming to rule the nations dominate them; and  their great ones exercise authority over them.

43. [3not 2thus 1But] will it be with you. But who ever should want to become great among you, shall be your servant.

44. And who ever of you should want to become first, shall be servant of all.

45. For even the son  of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give  his life a ransom for many. 

46.  Bar Timaeus Receives Sight And they come unto Jericho. And [2exiting 1of his] from Jericho, and  his disciples, and [2multitude 1a fit], a son of Timaeus -- Bar Timaeus the blind man, was sat down by the way begging.

47. And having heard that [2Jesus 3the 4Nazarene 1it is], he began to cry out, and to say, The son of David, Jesus, show mercy on me!

48. And [2reproached 3him 1many] that he should keep silent; but the more rather he cried out, O son of David, show mercy on me!

49. And Jesus stopping, spoke for him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage! Arise! he calls you.

50. And throwing off  his cloak, having risen up, he came to  Jesus.

51. And responding [2says 3to him  1Jesus], What do you want that I should do for you? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I should gain sight.

52. And Jesus said to him, Go! the belief of yours has delivered you. And immediately he gained sight, and he followed  Jesus in the way.  

## Mark 11

1.  Jesus Enters Jerusalem And when they approached unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany to the mount of the olives, he sends two  of his disciples.

2. And he says to them, Go into the town in front of you! And immediately entering into it, you will find a foal being tied, upon which not one of men has sat; having untied it, lead it!

3. And if anyone should say to you, Why do you do this? Say that,  Its master [2need 1has]; and immediately he will send it here!

4. And they went forth and found the foal being tied at the door outside upon the plaza; and they untied it.

5. And some of the ones standing there said to them, What do you do untying the foal?

6. And they spoke to them as Jesus gave charge; and they allowed them.

7. And they led the foal to  Jesus, and they put upon it  their cloaks; and he sat upon him.

8. And many  [2their cloaks 1spread out] in the way; and others [2boughs 1beat] from out of the trees, and spread them out in the way.

9. And the ones leading before, and the ones following, cried out, saying, Hosanna, being blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord.

10. Being blessed is the coming kingdom in the name of the Lord, of the one of our father David. Hosanna in the highest.

11. And [2entered 3into 4Jerusalem  1Jesus], and into the temple. And having looked round about all, [5late 4already 3being 1the 2hour], he went forth into Bethany with the twelve. 

12.  Jesus Curses the Fig Tree And in the next day of their coming forth from Bethany, he hungered.

13. And beholding a fig-tree far off having leaves, he went to see if he shall find anything on it. And having come upon it, [2nothing 1he found] except leaves; [3not 1for 2it was] the season of figs.

14. And responding  Jesus said to it, No longer from you into the eon [2not one 3fruit be 1may] to eat. And [2heard  1his disciples]. 

15.  Jesus Cleanses the Temple And they come into Jerusalem; and Jesus having entered into the temple began to cast out the ones selling and buying in the temple; and the tables of the money-changers and the chairs of the ones selling the doves he overturned;

16. and he did not allow that any carry vessels through the temple.

17. And he taught, saying to them, Has it not been written that,  My house [2a house 3of prayer 1shall be called] by all the nations? But you made it a cave of robbers.

18. And [6heard 1the 2scribes 3and 4the 5chief priests], and they sought how they should destroy him; for they feared him, for all the multitude were overwhelmed by  his teaching.

19. And when evening became, he went forth outside the city. 

20.  The Power of Belief And in the morning coming near, they beheld the fig-tree being dried up from the roots.

21. And calling to mind,  Peter says to him, Rabbi, see! the fig-tree which you cursed is dried up.

22. And responding  Jesus says to them, Have belief of God!

23. For amen I say to you, that who ever should say  to this mountain, Be lifted, and be thrown into the sea! and should not examine in  his heart, but should trust that what he says takes place, it will be to him what ever he should say.

24. On account of this I say to you, All as much as [2praying 1you ask], trust that you receive! and it will be to you.

25. And whenever you stand firmly praying, forgive! if you have anything against anyone, that also  your father, the one in the heavens should forgive you  your transgressions.

26. But if you do not forgive, not even  your father, the one in the heavens, shall forgive  your transgressions. 

27.  Jesus' Authority Questioned And they come again into Jerusalem. And in the temple during his walking, there comes to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders.

28. And they say to him, By what authority do you do these things? and, Who [2to you  3this authority 1gave] that you should do these things?

29. And Jesus answering said to them, [3shall ask 4you 1And 2I] one matter, and you answer me, and I will tell to you by what authority I do these things!

30. The immersion of John, [2from 3heaven 1was it] or from men? You answer me!

31. And they considered it among themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?

32. But if we should say, From men -- they feared the people; for all held  that John really was a prophet.

33. And answering they say to Jesus, We do not know. And  Jesus answering says to them, Nor I will tell you by what authority these things I do.  

## Mark 12

1.  The Parable of the Grower And he began [2to them 3in 4parables 1to speak]. [3a vineyard 2planted 1A man], and placed around it a barrier, and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and handed it over to growers, and traveled abroad.

2. And he sent to the growers [2at the 3season 1a servant], that [2from 3the 4growers 1he should receive] from the fruit of the vineyard.

3. But they having taken, flayed him, and sent him away empty.

4. And again he sent to them another servant, And that one having stoned, they smote on the head, and sent away being disgraced.

5. And again another he sent. And that one they killed, and many others; some flaying,  and some killing.

6. Still then [2one 3son 1having], his beloved, he sent him also to them last, saying that, They will show respect for  my son.

7. But those  growers said to themselves that, This is the heir; come, we should kill him, and [3will be ours 1the 2inheritance].

8. And taking him, they killed him, and cast him outside the vineyard.

9. What then shall he do -- the master of the vineyard? He will come and destroy the growers, and he will give the vineyard to others.

10. Nor  [2this scripture 1did you read], The stone which [3rejected 1the ones 2building], this is become for head of the corner.

11. By the Lord this happened, and it is wonderful in our eyes.

12. And they sought to seize him, and they feared the multitude; for they knew that [4against 5them 2the 3parable 1he spoke]. And leaving him they went forth. 

13.  The Pharisees Test Jesus And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they should catch him in a matter.

14. And they having come, say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and there is no care to you concerning anyone; [3not 1for 2you see] to the person of men, but in truth the way  of God you teach. Is it allowed [2tribute 3to Caesar 1to give], or not?

15. Should we give, or should we not give? And he, knowing their  hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you test me? Bring to me a denarius, that I should see it!

16. And they brought it. And he says to them, Whose  image is this and the inscription? And they said to him, Caesar.

17. And answering  Jesus said to them, Render the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things  of God  to God. And they marveled at him. 

18.  Jesus Questioned About the Resurrection And Sadducees came to him, the ones who say a resurrection not to be. And they asked him, saying,

19. Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if any brother should die, and should leave behind a wife, and [2children 1she should not leave], that [2should take  1his brother]  his wife, and should raise up seed to his brother.

20. [2seven 3brothers 1There were]. And the first took a wife, and dying he left no seed.

21. And the second took her, and he died, and not even he left seed. And the third likewise.

22. And [3took 4her 1the 2seven], and left no seed. Last of all [3died 4also 1the 2wife].

23. In then the resurrection, whenever they shall arise, which of them shall she be wife, for the seven had her for a wife?

24. And answering  Jesus said to them, [4not 1On account of 2this 3do you] err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power  of God?

25. For whenever [2from 3the dead 1they rise up], neither they marry nor are given in marriage; but are as angels, the ones in the heavens.

26. But concerning the dead, that they arise; did you not read in the book of Moses about the bush, as [2spoke 3to him  1God], saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of living. You then greatly erred. 

28.  The Foremost Commandment And [4having come forward 1one 2of the 3scribes], having heard them debating, knowing that [2well 3to them 1he answered], asked him, Which is foremost [2of all 1commandment]?

29.  And Jesus answered to him that, Foremost of all of the commandments, Hear, O Israel! The Lord  our God [3Lord 2one 1is].

30. And You shall love the Lord  your God from all  your heart, and from all  your soul, and from all  your thought, and from all  your strength. This is the foremost commandment.

31. And the second is likened to this, You shall love  your neighbor as yourself. Greater than these [3other 4commandment 2no 1is].

32. And [3said 4to him 1the 2scribe], Well teacher, in truth you spoke, that there is one God, and there is no other besides him.

33. And  to love him from the entire  heart, and from the entire  understanding, and from the entire  soul, and of the entire  strength, and  to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifice offerings.

34. And  Jesus beholding him, that prudently he answered, he said to him, [2not 3far 1You are] from the kingdom  of God. And no one any longer dared to question him.

35. And responding  Jesus said teaching in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David?

36. [3himself 1For 2David] said by [2spirit 1holy], [3said 1The 2Lord] to my Lord, Sit down at my right! until whenever I should make  your enemies a footstool  for your feet.

37. [3himself 2then 1David] calls him Lord. Then from where [2his son 1is he]? And the great multitude heard him with pleasure.

38. And he said to them in  his teaching, Take heed of the scribes, of the ones wanting [2in 3robes 1to walk], and greetings in the markets,

39. and first seats in the synagogues, and first place at the suppers,

40. the ones devouring the houses of the widows, and making an excuse [2long 1for praying] -- these shall receive more extra judgment! 

41.  The Widow's Offering And Jesus having sat down over against the treasury, viewed how the multitude cast money into the treasury. And many rich cast much.

42. And having come, one [2widow 1poor] threw [2leptas 1two], which is a quadrans.

43. And having called  his disciples, he says to them, Amen I say to you that  [3widow 1this  2poor 5more 6than all 4cast] of the ones casting into the treasury;

44. for all from out of  their abundance cast; but this woman from  her deficiency [2all 3as much as 4she had 1cast], [2entire  3livelihood 1her].  

## Mark 13

1.  Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple And as he was going forth from out of the temple, [3says 4to him 1one  2of his disciples], Teacher, behold what stones and what constructions!

2. And  Jesus responding said to him, You see these  great constructions; in no way shall there be left stone upon stone which shall not be broken up. 

3.  Signs of the End And as he was sitting in the mount  of olives opposite the temple, [8asked 9him 10in 11private 1Peter 2and 3James 4and 5John 6and 7Andrew],

4. Tell to us when these things will be, and what the sign is whenever [3are about 1all 2these things] to be completed!

5. And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed that not anyone should mislead you!

6. For many shall come in  my name, saying that, I am he. And [2many 1they shall mislead].

7. But whenever you should hear of wars and reports of wars, be not alarmed! for it is necessary to take place, but not yet is the end.

8. For shall rise up nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be earthquakes in different places, and there will be famines and disturbances; [2the beginnings 3of pangs 1these are].

9. [3take heed 1And 2you] to yourselves! for they shall deliver you up unto sanhedrins; and in synagogues you shall be flayed; and before governors and kings you shall be stood because of me, for a testimony to them.

10. And unto all the nations must first be proclaimed the good news.

11. And whenever they should lead you being delivered up, do not be anxious beforehand what you should speak, nor meditate upon! But what ever should be given to you in that  hour, this speak! [4not 1for 3are 2you] the ones speaking, but the [2spirit  1holy].

12. [3shall deliver up 1And 2brother] brother unto death, and a father a child; and [2shall rise up 1children] against parents, and shall put them to death.

13. And you will be a thing being detested by all on account of  my name; but the one remaining unto the end, this one shall be delivered. 

14.  The Abomination of Desolation And whenever you should behold the abomination of the desolation, the thing having been spoken by Daniel the prophet, standing where it must not, (let the one reading comprehend!) then [2the ones 3in  4Judea 1let] flee into the mountains!

15. And the one upon the roof, let him go not down into the house, nor enter to take anything from out of  his house!

16. And the one [2in 3the 4field 1being], let him not turn back to take  his cloak!

17. And woe to the ones [2in 3the womb 1having one], and to the ones nursing in those  days.

18. And pray that [2might not 3be 4in the 1your flight] winter!

19. [3will be 1For  2those days] an affliction, such as has not taken place with this kind from the beginning of creation of which God created until the present, and in no way shall be.

20. And unless the Lord cut short the days, not would [3have escaped 1any 2flesh]; but on account of the chosen ones whom he chose, he cut short the days.

21. And then if any should say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Behold, there; do not believe it!

22. For shall arise false christs and false prophets, and they shall give signs and miracles to  lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.

23. But you take heed! Behold, I have described beforehand to you all things.

24. And in those  days after  that affliction, the sun shall be made dark, and the moon shall not give  its brightness;

25. and the stars of the heaven will be falling off, and the powers, the ones in the heavens, shall be shaken.

26. And then they shall see the son  of man coming in clouds with [2power 1great] and glory.

27. And then he shall send  his angels, and they will assemble  his chosen ones from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth unto the uttermost part of heaven. 

28.  The Parable of the Fig-tree But from the fig-tree learn the parable! Whenever already her  [2branches 1tender] come to pass, and she should spring forth the leaves, know that [3near  1summer 2is]!

29. So also you, whenever you should see these taking place, know that it is near at the doors!

30. Amen I say to you that, in no way should [2pass by  1this generation], until of which time all these things should take place.

31. The heaven and the earth shall pass away; but my words in no way shall pass away.

32. But concerning  that day and of the hour no one knows, not even the angels, the ones in heaven, nor the son -- only the father.

33. Take heed, be awake and pray! [2you know not 1for] when the time is.

34. It is as a man going abroad leaving  his house, and giving to his servants the authority, and to each one  his work; and to the doorkeeper he gave charge that he should be vigilant.

35. Be vigilant then! [2you know not 1for] when the master of the house comes -- at evening, or at midnight, or at the crowing of a rooster, or in the morning;

36. lest coming suddenly he should find you sleeping.

37. And what shall I say to you -- to all I say, Be vigilant!  

## Mark 14

1.  Jesus' Life Threatened And it was the passover, and the holiday of the unleavened breads after two days. And [6sought 1the 2chief priests 3and 4the 5scribes] how [2him 3by 4treachery 5seizing him 1they should kill].

2. And they said, Not during the holiday, lest at any time there shall be a tumult of the people. 

3.  A Woman Anoints Jesus' Head And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, in his reclining, came a woman having an alabaster jar of perfumed [2spikenard 1liquid] of great cost; and having broken the alabaster jar, she poured it on his  head.

4. And there were some being indignant within themselves, and saying, For why  [2this loss  3of perfumed liquid 1has] taken place?

5. For it was possible to sell this above three hundred denarii, and to be given to the poor; and they strictly charged her.

6. And Jesus said, Let her go! Why [3for her 2troubles 1do you make]? [2a good 3work 1she worked] for me.

7. For at all times [2the 3poor 1you have] among yourselves, and whenever you want you are able [3for them 2good 1to do]; [5me 1but 3not 6at all times 2you do 4have].

8. What she has, she did; she first took to perfume my  body for the entombing.

9. Amen I say to you, Where ever [3should be proclaimed  2good news 1this] in the entire  world, even what this woman did shall be spoken for her memorial. 

10.  Judas Agrees to Deliver Up Jesus And  Judas  Iscariot, one of the twelve, went forth to the chief priests, that he should deliver him up to them.

11. And they hearing, rejoiced, and they promised [3to him 2money 1to give]. And he sought how opportunely he should deliver him up. 

12.  The Last Passover And on the first day of the unleavened breads, when [2the 3passover 1they sacrifice], [2say 3to him  1his disciples], Where do you want that going forth we shall prepare that you should eat the passover?

13. And he sends two  of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and [2will meet 3you 1a man 5a clay vessel 6of water 4bearing]; you follow him!

14. And where ever he should enter, say to the master of the house that, The teacher says, Where is the lodging where [2the 3passover 4with  5my disciples 1I should eat]?

15. And he will show to you [2upper room 1a great] being spread out prepared; there prepare for us!

16. And [2went forth  1his disciples] and came into the city, and they found it as he said to them; and they prepared the passover.

17. And evening having become, he comes with the twelve.

18. And as they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, Amen I say to you that, one of you shall deliver me up, the one eating with me.

19. And they began to grieve, and to say to him one by one, No, how I? and another, No, how I?

20. And answering he said to them, One from out of the twelve, the one dipping with me into the saucer.

21. Indeed the son  of man goes away, as it has been written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom the son  of man is delivered up; it was good to him if [3was not 4born  2man 1that].

22. And as they were eating, Jesus having taken the bread, having blessed, broke and gave to them. And he said, Take! Eat! this is  my body.

23. And having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave to them, and [2drank 3of 4it 1all].

24. And he said to them, This is  my blood, the blood of the new covenant, the blood [2for 3many 1being poured out].

25. Amen I say to you that, No longer in any way shall I drink of the offspring of the grapevine, until  that day whenever I should drink it new in the kingdom  of God. 

26.  Jesus Foretells Peter's Rejection And having sung praise, they came forth unto the mount  of olives.

27. And [2says 3to them  1Jesus] that, All shall be stumbled in me in  this night; for it has been written, I will strike the shepherd, and [3will be dispersed 1the 2sheep].

28. But after  my arising, I will lead before you into  Galilee.

29. And Peter said to him, Even if all shall be stumbled, yet not I.

30. And [2says 3to him  1Jesus], Amen I say to you that, today in  this night, before  twice the rooster calls out loud, three times you shall totally reject me.

31. And he all the extra said, Rather if it should be for me to die together with you, in no way shall I totally reject you. And likewise also all spoke. 

32.  Jesus in Gethsemane And they came unto a place of which the name is Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples, Sit here while I pray!

33. And taking  Peter and  James and John with himself, and he began to be astonished and anxious.

34. And he says to them, [2is dejected  1My soul] unto death. Abide here and be vigilant!

35. And having gone forth a little, he fell upon the ground, and prayed that, if it is possible [3might pass 4from 5him 1the 2hour].

36. And he said, Abba  father, all things are possible with you; carry away  [2cup 3from 4me 1this]! but not what I want, but what you want.

37. And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Were you not able one hour to be vigilant?

38. Be vigilant and pray! that you should not enter into a test. Indeed the spirit is eager, but the flesh weak.

39. And again, having gone forth he prayed, [2the 3same 4word 1having said].

40. And having returned, he found them again sleeping, [3were 1for  2their eyes] being weighed down, and they did not know what they should answer to him.

41. And he comes the third time, and he says to them, Sleep the remaining and rest! Be at a distance! [3came 1the 2hour]. Behold, [4is delivered up 1the 2son  3of man] into the hands  of sinners.

42. Arise! we should lead on. Behold, the one delivering me up approaches.

43. And immediately while he was speaking, Judas comes, being one of the twelve, and with him [2multitude 1a great] with swords and wood spears, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 

44.  Jesus Betrayed by a Kiss [4had given 1And 2the one 3delivering him up] an agreed upon sign to them, saying, Whom ever I should kiss, it is he; Seize him, and take him away safely!

45. And having come, immediately having come forward to him, he says to him, Rabbi, rabbi; and he kissed him.

46. And they put upon him  their hands, and seized him.

47. [3one 1But 2a certain] of the ones standing by, having unsheathed the sword, hit the servant of the chief priest, and removed his  ear.

48. And responding  Jesus said to them, As unto a robber do you come forth with swords and wood spears to seize me?

49. By day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me; but it is that [3should be fulfilled 1the 2scriptures].

50. And leaving him, all fled.

51. And one certain young man follows him, having put on a fine linen garment upon his naked body; and [3seized 4him 1the 2young men];

52.  but leaving behind the fine linen garment, [2naked 1he fled] from them. 

53.  Jesus Before the Sanhedrin And they took  Jesus to the chief priest. And [4gather 5to him 1all 2the 3chief priests], and the elders, and the scribes.

54. And  Peter from far off followed him, even inside into the courtyard of the chief priest. And he was sitting together with the officers, and being heated by the light.

55. And the chief priests and the entire  sanhedrin sought [2against  3Jesus 1testimony] to  put him to death; and they did not find.

56. For many witnessed falsely against him, and [4equal 1the 2testimonies 3were not].

57. And certain ones having risen up witnessed falsely against him, saying that,

58. We heard him saying that, I shall break up  this temple made with hands, and in three days [2another 3not made by hands 1I will build].

59. And not even thus [3equal 1was  2their testimony].

60. And [3having risen up 1the 2chief priest] into the midst, questioned  Jesus, saying, Do you not answer one thing? What is it these are bearing witness against you?

61. And he kept silent, and not one thing did he answer. Again the chief priest questioned him, and says to him, Are you the Christ, the son of the blessed?

62.  And Jesus said, I am, and you shall see the son  of man sitting on the right of the power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven.

63. And the chief priest, having torn  his inner garments, says, What yet need do we have of witnesses?

64. You heard the blasphemy; what does it appear to you? And they all condemned him to be liable of death.

65. And some began to spit on him, and to cover  his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy! And the officers [2slaps 3at him 1threw]. 

66.  Peter Denies Jesus And Peter being in the courtyard below, there comes one of the maidservants of the chief priest.

67. And beholding  Peter heating himself, having looked at him, she says, Even you [2with 3the 4Nazarene 5Jesus 1were].

68. But he denied, saying, I have not known him, nor have knowledge of what you say. And he went forth outside into the porch of the courtyard; and a rooster called out.

69. And the maidservant beholding him, again began to say to the ones standing by that, This one [2of 3them 1is].

70. And he again denied. And after a little time, again the ones standing by said  to Peter, Truly [2of 3them 1you are], for even you are a Galilean, and  your speech coincides.

71. And he began to devote to consumption and to swear by an oath that, I have not known  this man of whom you speak.

72. And a second time a rooster called out. And Peter called to mind the saying which [2said 3to him  1Jesus] that, Before a rooster calls out twice, you shall totally reject me three times. And giving it attention he wept.  

## Mark 15

1.  Jesus Before Pilate And immediately in the morning, a council having been appointed, the chief priests with the elders and the scribes, and the entire  sanhedrin, having bound  Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up  to Pilate.

2. And [2questioned 3him  1Pilate], Are you the king of the Jews?  And answering he said to him, You say it.

3. And [3charged 4him 1the 2chief priests] much; but he [2not one thing 1answered].

4.  And Pilate again questioned him, saying, Do you not answer one thing? See how much they bear witness against you!

5. But Jesus no longer [2anything 1answered], so that Pilate marveled.

6. And according to the holiday he loosed to them one prisoner, whomsoever they asked.

7. And there was the one being called Barabbas, [2with 3the 4joint-conspirators 1being bound], the ones who with the faction [2murder 1committed].

8. And yelling out, the multitude began to ask him to do as continually he did to them.

9. And Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want that I should release to you the king of the Jews?

10. For he knew that through envy [3delivered him up 1the 2chief priests].

11. But the chief priests incited the multitude, that rather  he should release Barabbas to them. 

12.  Jesus is Scourged and Crucified  And Pilate responding again said to them, What then do you want that I shall do to whom you call king of the Jews?

13. And again they cried out, Crucify him!

14. And Pilate said to them, For what evil did he?  But they more exceedingly cried out, Crucify him!

15. And Pilate, wanting [3for the 4multitude  2that which was fit 1to do], released to them  Barabbas. And he delivered up  Jesus, having been scourged, that he should be crucified.

16. And the soldiers took him away inside the courtyard, which is the praetorium; and they called together the entire  cohort.

17. And they clothed him in purple, and [4they put it on 5him 1having plaited 2a thorny 3crown].

18. And they began to salute him, Hail, O king of the Jews!

19. And they beat him on the head with a reed, and spat on him; and setting the knees they did obeisance to him.

20. And when they mocked him, they took [3off 4him 1the 2purple], and put on him  [2garments  1his own], and they led him out that they should crucify him.

21. And they conscripted one passing by, a certain Simon a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he should carry  his cross.

22. And they brought him unto Golgotha, a place which is being translated, [2of a Skull 1Place].

23. And they gave to him [3to drink 1myrrh mixed with 2wine];  but he did not take.

24. And having crucified him, they divided  his garments, casting a lot over them, who should take what.

25. And it was [2hour 1the third], and they crucified him.

26. And there was the inscription  of his accusation being inscribed, The king of the Jews.

27. And with him they crucified two robbers, one at his right, and one at his left.

28. And [3was fulfilled 1the 2scripture], the one saying, And [2with 3lawless ones 1he was imputed].

29. And the ones coming near blasphemed him, shaking  their heads, and saying, Ah, the one breaking up the temple and in three days rebuilding,

30. deliver yourself, and come down from the cross!

31. And in like manner the chief priests mocking among one another with the scribes saying, Others he delivered, himself he is not able to deliver.

32. The Christ, the king  of Israel, let him come down now from the cross! that we should know and should believe. And the ones being crucified along with him berated him. 

33.  Jesus Expires And having become [2hour 1the sixth], darkness took place upon the entire  land until [2hour 1the ninth].

34. And in the [2hour  1ninth] Jesus yelled out [2voice 1a great], saying, Eloi, eloi, lima sabacthani? which is being translated,  My God,  my God, for why did you abandon me?

35. And some of the ones standing by, having heard, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.

36. [3having run 1And 2one] and filled the sponge with vinegar, and having put it on also a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Allow it! we should see if Elijah comes to lower him.

37. And Jesus letting go [2voice 1with a great], expired. 

38.  The Veil of the Temple Splits And the veil of the temple split in two, from above unto below.

39. And beholding, the centurion, the one standing by opposite him, that thus having cried out he expired, said, Truly  this man was son of God.

40. And there were also women from far off viewing, among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the one of James the less and Joses mother, and Salome,

41. (the ones who also when he was in the Galilee followed him, and served him) and [2others 1many] -- the ones going up with him unto Jerusalem. 

42.  The Burial of Jesus And already evening having become (since it was the preparation which is before the Sabbath,)

43. there came Joseph, the one from Arimathea, a decent counselor, who also himself was waiting for the kingdom  of God. He having dared entered to Pilate, and asked the body  of Jesus.

44. And Pilate marveled that already he has died. And having called the centurion, he questioned him if [2earlier 1he died].

45. And having known from the centurion, he presented the body  to Joseph.

46. And having bought fine linen, and having lowered him, he wrapped him in the fine linen; and he laid him down in a tomb, which was quarried from out of rock, and he rolled a stone upon the door of the tomb.

47.  And Mary the Magdalene and Mary of Joses viewed where he was placed.  

## Mark 16

1.  The Resurrection of Jesus And the elapsing of the Sabbath, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the one of James, and Salome, bought aromatics, that having come they should anoint him.

2. And exceedingly in the morning of day one of the Sabbaths, they come unto the tomb, at the rising of the sun.

3. And they said among themselves, Who will roll away [3for us 1the 2stone] from the door of the tomb?

4. And having looked up, they viewed that [3was rolled away 1the 2stone]; for it was [2great 1exceedingly].

5. And having entered into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting down on the right, being clothed [2apparel 1in white]; and they were astonished.

6. And he says to them, Do not be astonished! You seek Jesus the Nazarene, the one having been crucified; he was arisen, he is not here; see the place where they put him!

7. But go! say to his disciples and to Peter that he goes before you unto  Galilee; there you shall see him, as he said to you.

8. And having come forth quickly, they fled from the tomb. [5took hold of 1And 6them 2trembling 3and 4a change of state]; and [2no one 3not one thing 1they told]; for they were afraid. 

9.  Jesus Appears to Mary and the Disciples And having risen in the morning on the first day of the Sabbath, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.

10. That one having gone reported to the ones [2with 3him 1having been], who were mourning and weeping.

11. And those having heard that he lives, and was seen by her, disbelieved.

12. And after these things with two of them walking, he was made manifest in another appearance going into the field.

13. And those having gone forth reported to the rest; and those neither believed.

14. Afterwards with them reclining, [2to them 3to the 4eleven 1he was made manifest], and he berated  their unbelief and hardness of heart, that to the ones seeing him being arisen they did not believe.

15. And he said to them, Having gone into the world all together, proclaim the good news to all in the creation!

16. The one believing and being immersed shall be delivered; but the one disbelieving shall be condemned.

17. And signs to these believing shall follow closely; in  my name [2demons 1they shall cast out]; [3languages 3they shall speak 2new];

18. [2serpents 1they shall take away]; and if anything deadly they shall drink, in no way shall it hurt them; [3upon 4ill ones 2hands 1they shall place], and [2well 1they shall suffice].

19. So then the Lord, after  speaking with them, was taken up into the heaven, and he sat at the right  of God.

20. And those having gone forth, proclaimed everywhere of the Lord, and were working together [2the 3word 1firming] by the [2following after 1signs]. Amen.
