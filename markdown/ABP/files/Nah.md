# Nahum

## Nahum 1

1.  The Concern of Nineveh The concern for Nineveh. The scroll of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

2. God is jealous, and the lord is punishing; the lord is punishing with rage; the lord is punishing  his adversaries, and lifting away himself  of his enemies.

3. The lord is lenient, and great is  his strength; and [4one as innocent 2will not 3acquit 1the lord]; [2is by 3consummation 4and 5by 6a rumbling  1his way], and the clouds are the dust of his feet;

4. the one pressing together the sea, and the one drying it, and [2all 3the 4rivers 1making quite desolate]. [4are lessened  1Bashan 2and  3Carmel], and the blossoming  of Lebanon failed.

5. The mountains shake from him, and the hills are shaken, and [3rises upwards 1the 2earth] at his presence; the whole, and all the ones dwelling in it.

6. From in front of his anger who shall stand, and who shall withstand in the anger of his rage?  His rage melts away sovereignties, and the rocks are broken because of him.

7. Gracious is the lord to the ones waiting on him in the day of affliction; and he is knowing of the ones venerating him.

8. And by a flood coursing [2a consummation 1he shall execute] of the ones rousing up; and  [3his enemies 2shall pursue 1darkness].

9. What do you devise against the lord? [3a consummation 1He himself 2will make]. He will not punish twice for the same thing with affliction.

10. For the enemy [2unto 3his foundation 1will be made barren], and as a yew tree being twisted he shall be devoured, even as stubble he shall be dried up fully.

11. From out of you shall come forth a device against the lord, [2wicked things 1planning] adverse to him.

12. Thus says the lord, who rules many waters, And so they shall be drawn apart, and the report of you shall not be listened to attentively any longer.

13. And now I will break  his rod from you, and the bonds I will tear up.

14. And [2shall give charge 3concerning 4you 1the lord], There shall not be sown the report of  your name any longer from out of the house of your god; I will utterly destroy the carved images, and the molten images; I will establish your burial, and that quickly.

15. Behold upon the mountains the feet announcing good news, and reporting peace. Solemnize, O Judah,  your holidays! Render  your vows! For in no way should they proceed any longer  to go through you, for they should have grown old.  

## Nahum 2

1.  The Destruction of Nineveh He is finished, he is consumed, [4ascended 5breathing 6in 7your face 1the one being lifted away 2from out of 3affliction]. Watch the way! Hold the loin! Be [2manly 3in 4strength 1very]!

2. For the lord perverted the insolence of Jacob, as the insolence  of Israel; for the ones shaking off shook them off, and  [2their vine branches 1they ruined].

3. The weapons of his command of men [2men 1are mighty] mocking with fire; the reins  of their chariots in the day of his preparation, and the horsemen shall be making a disruption.

4. In the ways; [3shall be in tumult 1the 2chariots], and shall be closely joined in the squares; the sight of them as lamps of fire, and as lightnings running along.

5. And [2shall be remembering  1their great men], and shall flee by day; and they shall be weak in  their goings; and they shall hasten unto the walls, and they shall prepare  [2advance guards 1their].

6. Gates of the cities were opened wide, and the palaces fell into ruin,

7. and the support was uncovered; and she ascended, and  her maidservants were led away as doves, uttering sounds in their hearts.

8. And Nineveh, [2are as 3a pool 4of water  1her waters]; and they fleeing did not stand, and there was none  paying attention.

9. They plundered the silver, they plundered the gold, and there was no limit  to her decoration; they were weighed down by all  [2items  1her desirable].

10. Thrusting and violent shaking, and tumult, and heart breaking, and loosening of the knees, and pangs on every loin, and the face of all as a burnt earthen pot.

11. Where is the home of the lions, and the pasture  being to the cubs? Where [2go 1did the lion], for [3to enter 4there 2cub 1the lion], and there was none  frightening?

12. The lion seized by force the things fit  for his cubs, and choked prey  for his young lions, and filled [2with game 1his nest], and  his home of things of seizure.

13. Behold, I am against you, says the lord almighty, and I will burn away [3in 4smoke 2multitude 1your], and  your lions I will devour by the broadsword, and I will utterly destroy [2from out of 3the 4land  1your game], and in no way should [2be heard of 3yet  1your works].  

## Nahum 3

1.  Iniquity of Nineveh O city of blood, entirely false, [2of iniquity 1full], [2shall not 3be handled 1the game].

2. The sound of whips, and the sound of quaking of wheels, and [2horse 1the pursuing], and the chariot stirring up,

3. horseman ascending, and of the shining broadsword, and flashing shields; and the multitude of slain, and of a heavy downfall; and there was no limit to her nations, and they shall be weak in  their bodies from a multitude of harlotry;

4. [2harlot 1a good], and gratifying, taking the lead in potions; the one selling nations in  her harlotry, and tribes with  her potions.

5. Behold, I am against you, says the lord almighty. And I will uncover  your behind in  your presence, and I will show the nations  your shame, and to kingdoms  your dishonor.

6. And I will cast upon you an abomination according to  your uncleannesses, and I will make you for an example.

7. And it will be all the ones seeing you shall go from you, and shall say, Wretched Nineveh, who shall moan her? From what place shall I seek comfort to her?

8. Tune the string of the lyre! Prepare a part for Amon, the one inhabiting in rivers! Water is round about her, whose  rule is the sea, and [2water  1her walls].

9. Ethiopia is her strength, and Egypt. And there stood no limit  of your flight into exile. Put and Libya became her helpers.

10. And she into displacement shall go captive; and  her infants they shall dash upon corners of all  her ways; and over all  her honorable things they shall cast lots, and all  her great men shall be tied with manacles.

11. And you shall be intoxicated. And you shall be for overlooking, and you shall seek for yourself a position from enemies.

12. All  your fortresses are as you, [2fruits 1having], and if they should be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of ones eating.

13. Behold,  your people are as women among you to the ones your enemies. By opening [3shall be open 1the gates  2of your land]. [2shall devour 1Fire] the bars of your gates.

14. [2water 4for being encompassed about 1Draw 3to yourself]! Secure  your fortresses! Step into the mortar, and trample it together with straw! Secure it more than with a brick!

15. There [2shall devour 3you 1the fire]; [2shall utterly destroy 3you 1the broadsword]; it shall devour you as a locust, and you shall be oppressed as a grasshopper.

16. You multiplied  your trade above the stars of the heaven. The grasshopper advanced and spread forth.

17. [2leaped out 3as 4the small locust  1Your consolidation], as the locust mounted upon a fence on [2day 1an icy]; the sun rises, and it hops, and knows not  its place -- woe to them.

18. [2slumbered  1Your shepherds], O king of Assyria, [2rested  1your mighty ones]. [2departed  1Your people] unto the mountains, and there was none  looking out for them.

19. There is no healing to your destruction; [2is inflamed  1your wound]. All the ones hearing the message of you clap hands over you. For upon whom [2not 3come upon  1did your evil] continually?
